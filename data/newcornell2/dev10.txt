you may well call it upside down , since you occupy its lowest level . and deservedly . the eastern desert has never been explored -- because we 've always assumed that no life can exist there . save yourself , taylor . tell me -- is there another jungle beyond the forbidden zone ?	i do n't know .
if you are protecting others of your kind , it will cost you your identity .	i 'm not protecting anybody ! that hearing was a farce . what have i done ?
stop right there .	do n't be a fool . you 're outnumbered and outgunned .
there is no contradiction between faith and science . true science .	all right , let 's see if you 're willing to put that statement to a test .
what is your proposal ?	when were the sacred scrolls written ?
twelve hundred years ago .	very well . if zira and cornelius can prove that those scrolls do n't tell the whole truth of your history ; if they can show you definite evidence of another culture from an unrecorded past -- will you exonerate them ?
of course .	okay.up to the cave .
i do n't say he was a man like an earthman , but i 'd call him a close relative , for he was plagued by most of man 's ills . yet , fragile as he was , he came before you -- and was superior to you .	that 's lunacy . i can give an alternate description for everyone of those objects that 's equally as inventive as yours . but it would be conjecture , not proof .
tell him to pull back !	cease fire ! withdraw !
then answer this : if ran was superior , why did n't he survive ?	he might have been wiped out by a plague . natural catastrophe . like a fiery storm of meteors . from the looks of this part of your planet , i 'd say that was a fair bet .
then there is another jungle ?	of course , you could return with us . our society might find a place for you and your mate .
sure . in a cage .	where else , but in a cage , does man belong ?
why ? from the first , i 've terrified you , doctor . and in spite of every sign that i 'm an intelligent being who means no harm , you continue to hate and fear me . why ?	because you are a man . and you were right -- i have always known about man . from the evidence , i believe his wisdom must walk hand in hand with his idiocy . his emotions must rule his brain . he must be a warlike animal who gives battle to everything around him -- even himself .
what evidence ? no weapons were found in the cave .	the forbidden zone was once a paradise . your breed made a desert of it , ages ago .
we 're back at the beginning . i still do n't know the why . a planet where apes evolved from men . a world turned wrong side up . a puzzle with one piece missing .	do n't look for it , taylor . you may not like what you find .
well , bright eyes , is our throat feeling better ?	listen , listen -- i can speak --
speak ! go on . speak again .	my - name - is n't - bright eyes it 's taylor !
i 'm not acting ! i can talk ! how much proof do you want ?	dr. zaius , i could have sworn he was answering you !
where have you been ? why did n't you come to see me ?	shhhh !
what is this ?	a hearing .
it 's him ... landon .	which one ?
you ! ... you knew about this ?	no , i swear -- i never saw this man before .
listen-	taylor -- just keep quiet and we may get away with this . remember that men all look alike to most apes .
cornelius and i have been indicted for heresy . unless we can prove our theories , we do n't stand a chance of acquittal .	you 're going back to the forbidden zone ?
are you going to take her with you ?	yes .
actually , you 're a different breed . this creature will never evolve .	maybe not .
you want her that much ?	you threw us together , remember ? and you guessed right . men , like apes , get despondent without a mate .
what 's the diagnosis , doctor ? a touch of the sun ?	she 's not sick at all . she 's pregnant .
and that 's your minister of science . honor- bound to expand the frontiers of knowledge .	taylor , please --
taylor ! tell him .	he has a point . on my planet children often play with ape dolls .
then tell them dr. zaius wo n't leave here alive .	taylor , you ca n't .
taylor , please -- do n't treat him that way .	why not ?
it 's humiliating .	was n't i humiliated ? by all of you ? did n't you lead me around on a leash ?
would you like to come along ?	we ca n't .
dr. zira , i 'd like to kiss you good-bye .	all right , but ... . ... you 're so damned ugly !
go with god , taylor . that 's an old expression . it comes from both ape and man .	god bless you .
he 's moving his fingers !	of course . he saw you moving yours .
would n't it more properly be done in your office ?	yes , sir .
dr. zira -- you state here that a ship from outer space sank in an inland sea of our eastern desert .	i do not state it , sir . the prisoner does .
do you believe him ?	like you , i find it difficult .
but how convenient that the proof of his arrival has vanished ? you also state that bright eyes had two intelligent companions at the time of his capture .	this is his assertion .
how sad . stuffed and mounted , eh ? dead men , like sunken ships , can tell no stories . and his other companion ?	he does n't know .
let them talk , mr president . let them talk .	sirs : our theories have a bearing on his identity .
secondly , if these 'tools ' as you call them , are unidentified , why are they introduced as 'evidence ' of anything ?	but there 's the doll , sir .
but suppose you find nothing but a wasteland . how will you survive ?	he wo n't survive . do you know what sort of life awaits you out there , taylor ? that of an animal . if you are n't eventually hunted down and killed by apes , some jungle beast will devour you .
but the proof ? the doll ?	in a few minutes there will be no doll . there ca n't be . i 'm sorry .
bunker ...	where ?
... but 'lias is still out there .	i 'll get him . you get the man in , taylor now . or i 'll article 15 both your asses . move !
elias is dead . join up with the platoon . move it .	he 's dead ! where ? ... you saw him ?

way out of anything , man . just keep your pecker up , your powder dry , the worm will turn . how many days you short ?	not just me ... it 's the way the whole thing works . people like elias get wasted and people like barnes just go on making up rules any way they want and what do we do , we just sit around in the middle and suck on it ! we just do n't add up to dry shit .
hey that 's great king , that 's great ... you take it on home for me , you tell 'em king ... got your address right ? you know where you can reach men , man . anytime !	i got ta didi man . do n't wan na miss that chopper . i 'll send you a postcard . after i get me some . i 'll send you some tapes too man . this new guy jimi hendrix man , whew ... you okay taylor ? just 'member take it easy now , do n't think too much , do n't be a fool , no such thing as a coward cause it do n't mean nuthin . jes keep on keepin ' on . okay my man ...

sounds pretty far out to me 'lias .	maybe but i seen it happen at ia drang in '66 , first cavalry and they cut us to fuckin ' pieces ! give me three men , if i 'm wrong , i can still roll up that flank .
whatcha doing in the underworld taylor ?	this ai n't taylor . taylor been shot . this man chris been resurrected ...
merle ?	merle ? jesus ! ... patty ?
whew ! - where that come from ?	found it . growing in a garden .
i know barnes six months and i 'll tell ya something - that man is mean , red in his soul like a dick on a dog .	barnes gets killed , his jaws 'd go on clacking ...
he done a year in japan in the hospital , then when he gets out , the first thing he done is re-up . four years he been in the field ...	... and you know how many times he done been shot ? seven times ! seven .
the good lord works his revenge in strange ways .	yeah , you done said it . revenge on us .

tennessee someplace . hill country .	barnes took a bullet right there . at ia drang valley ... and the cocksucker survived - that 's baaad man . that 's his high , baby . high on war !
well he ai n't normal that 's fo sure .	that 's what he is ... baaaa !
i was home on leave y'know and everybody 's just worried 'bout making money , everybody 's out for themselves , they do n't even want to talk about it man , it 's like the fucking twilight zone back there - you would n't even know there 's a war on here . my sister says to me why you have to go there like i started this ...	baaaa ! fuck it , they sold us out - so what ! what 'd you'all expect ? civilian life is phoney bullshit man . they 're robots man - watchin ' dopey television and drivin ' dopey cars , and they fuck up , nobody dies . that 's all right , you keep fuckin ' up , politicians keep lyin ' . cause it do n't really matter . do n't mean shit . so what ! whatcha want - a parade ! fuck that too ! no war time no grunt never got no respect . till he was dead - and even then ! you 're fighting for yourself man ! you 're fighting for your soul , dat 's all . remember dat . and it 's some goddamn battle too - if you'se a man , wrestle with that angel ... ... love and hate - the whole shitbang show , that 's the story then and now and it ai n't hardly gon na change ...
you wanted to see me sir ?	jackson , looks like you got elias ' squad now .
squad ? i did n't know we was still referring to this platoon in terms of squads sir .	these two holes are yours ...
begging your pardon lieutenant but my holes are far enuff apart you could run a regiment through there and nobody 'd see them - i got five live bodies left ...	i do n't want to hear your problems , jackson . you 'll get new men any day . time being you make do like everybody else .
hey lieutenant i did n't ask for this job , i ...	i do n't want to hear about it jackson .
you do n't want to hear about it ?	that 's right . i do n't want to hear about it 'cause to tell you the truth , i do n't give a shit okay ... i just do n't give a shit anymore .
right ...	this is one time we could sure use elias .
no thanks , i 've seen seattle .	my name 's larry mitchell . i live in vancouver .
same as an hour ago . remember ? i 'm the steady type .	i 'm afraid there 's nothing i can do about it , mr. mitchell .
you could tell me your name . and where you 're going .	how far does this train go ?
vancouver , b.c .	i 'm going to vancouver , mr. mitchell .
or reno ? they always throw them off the bridge there , i 've heard .	perhaps i do n't take it so lightly .
where are you staying in vancouver royal . it 's pretty crowded you know .	is it ? i expected to go to the vancouver royal . should i have a reservation ?
i 'll make one for you . i live there .	well..
a very small service . it does n't even ask for thanks . how long for ?	i really do n't know .
indefinitely ?	i do n't know .
nice room . balcony and everything . lovely view too .	very nice mitchell turns .
no thanks ?	thank you .
suppose i had n't known that immigration inspector ? had n't put in a good word for you ?	i 'm supposing .
i have a darned good idea you 're name is n't betty mayfield at all .	yes ?
how about taking to uncle larry into the old firm ? he 's a useful guy to have on your side .	
dine and dance tonight ? i 've got fifty bucks to throw away .	not tonight .
what 's the matter ?	i 'm not in the mood for dining and dancing .
we have some nice places around vancouver .	i 'm sure you have .
well , how about a breeze up to the penthouse about six o'clock ? a friend of mine is throwing a cocktail party up there .	i have n't been invited .
nobody gets invited to clark brandon 's parties . they just go .	perhaps i 'd better get you straightened out , mr. mitchell . you 've been rather nice to me , in a couple of ways . and i 'm grateful . but i do n't think this entitles you to put me on a leash .
the brush-off , huh ?	i 'm trying very hard to be polite about it .
do n't i even get my face slapped ?	would you mind ?
okay . you win .	if you change your mind about the cocktail party , or anything else , give me a buzz .
betty , this is margo west . she wants to meet you . miss mayfield .	how do you do ?
i think i 'd like to dance .	why certainly , baby .
please be a little more careful how you talk , mr. mitchell .	how careful should i be ?
i do n't like being referred to as babe , or addressed as baby . i do n't like your possessive attitude , nor your hints of secret knowledge . in fact , to be very frank , mr. mitchell , i do n't think i like you .	maybe you 're going to have to like me .
i think you 're drunk .	just drunk enough .
what 's the matter , baby ? do n't you like being kissed ?	next time you try that , mr. mitchell ... ..do n't . i 'm warning you .
good evening , miss .	how soon can i get a plane to seattle ?
i 'm afraid there 's nothing more tonight , miss . unless you charter a plane .	how long would that take ?
well ... they have to service the plane ... and get a pilot down to the field , unless there 's one hanging around there still ... and then they have to get the immigration officer ...	immigration officer ?
they might think i was running away from something .	possibly , miss .
good morning . can i do something for you ?	i 'm miss mayfield . is mr. campbell here ?
i 'm mr. campbell , miss mayfield . purely as a matter of routine , i want to ask the name of your bank .	bank ?
merely for our records , miss mayfield . it 's usual for the guests who come here for the first time .	i 'm carrying quite a large sum in travelers checks . how much of a deposit would you like ?
you can have the table yourself , if you 'd rather . i 'm only killing time .	no , please .
sit down then . we often have a double up here .	i see .
your liquor laws..	disgusting , are n't they ? if you really want a martini , i know where you can get one .
a fellow named brandon has a penthouse here . he 's holding open house . i was up there . too noisy . bored .	i see .
it might be worth a martini to you .	i do n't need it that badly . i do n't enjoy crashing other people 's parties .
it 's open-house . no crashing involved . anybody in the hotel 's welcome .	what did you say his name was ?
brandon . clark brandon . fellow about my age . lot of money ... that he did n't make . former american . now naturalized in canada . social standing indeterminate . manners not quite perfect . scotch superb .	you do n't sound as if you liked him very much .
no.. not very well . and i like his friends even less . but.. if you really want a good dry martini..	as i said before ...
you 're not paying for this . it 's quite enough that you let me sit at your table .	i never pay for anything . they just keep me here to amuse the guests .
and do you amuse the guests ?	no . are you really going to drink that stuff ?
you 're drinking it .	i can be talked out of it . as a matter of fact , i 'd like a dry martini myself .
would it make you anymore amusing ?	whatever you say .
i did n't say anything .	i do n't know you and you do n't know me . i made a reasonably polite suggestion . but i 'm sure you 'd rather be alone .
neatly said ... but to the wrong man . the trouble with pretty girls is that they ca n't imagine anyone thinking of anything else but the fact they are pretty girls . i get tired of it .	do you think i do n't ?
thanks for the fresh air . that felt good .	you 're sure mr. brandon wo n't mind ?
dance ?	no thank you .
i know it 's a littler late for an apology .	much too late .
you said it was n't a tragedy .	what 's funny about that ? if you pick up people like larry mitchell other people are bound to get funny ideas about you . the world is full of larry mitchells .
there is n't one.. that anyone would believe . i went for a walk after dinner , down to the ocean ... alone ... i came up and went to bed . i did n't sleep very well . then there was a thunderstorm . and it began to rain . i went across to close the french door . that 's the first time i saw him out there .	he got in here how ?
no . and i 've never fired a gun in my life , are n't you supposed not to touch it ?	sure ... but somebody always does..
they 'll know whether he killed himself .	i do n't .
how did you meet him ?	on a train . he said he lived here , and he offered to make a reservation for me .
nice of him .	he knew the immigration officer . he eased himself in .
he was a great boy for that . what else ?	that 's all there is .
go ahead ... if you want to . it does n't matter .	i 'd rather wait until it does matter .
you tried to run away .	there was n't any plane .
want a spike in it ?	no thanks .
there 's one thing i may as well tell you . you 'll find it out anyhow . i tried to run away -- when i found him out there on the balcony . there was n't any plane .	you did n't have to tell him that .
bad ?	bad enough .
he could hardly help suspecting you .	that 's putting it mildly .
what time is it ?	quarter after one . why ?
there 's a lot of night left to live through .	so there is . you do n't want to go to bed . i do n't want to go to bed . let 's go somewhere and hear some music -- have something to drink -- something to eat -- even dance .
dance ? tonight ?	let 's not pretend mitchell meant anything to either of us .
certainly not to me .	just who are you , anyway ?
you , too ? my name is betty mayfield . i was born , and i am here . message ends . that 's what i told him . he did n't like it .	i 'm different . i like it fine .
cold ?	is this the best you can do ?
want to dance ?	dance ? here ?
why not ?	they know you here -- know your name .
that man over there . he was in the hotel lobby .	i did n't notice him .
we walked right passed him . he 's following us .	killaine 's not that sort of guy . he said no -- he meant no .
then he 's got to be a detective .	could n't be .
quite sure you saw him in the hotel lobby ?	absolutely sure .
he 's a fellow with a very hard knee , and he knows how to use it .	you do n't know who he is ?
he 's not a cop . a cop would n't have kneed me .	he was following us -- but he 's not a policeman .
us ?	all right -- following me .
why ?	no matter . there 's nothing i can do about it .
anything i can do about it ?	take me home -- and forget you ever saw me . that 's a silly remark is n't it ?
it still does n't matter if i kiss you ?	nothing matters .
that 's the second round i 've lost tonight . that fellow hurt me .	so have i .
it sounds like a fair location . could you be a little more exact ?	i 'm in the hudson bay company 's store . that man last night -- the one that followed me --
cant be too close for me . right across the street from it suits me . anything else listed ?	there 's another man -- right outside the booth here . i never saw him before .
i hated to go to that place . i almost went to the police station instead .	no percentage in that .
they 're going to arrest me .	i know . killaine has a warrant .
if you meant it , you would n't show it to me , betty . or am i supposed to deliver it to dear inspector killaine ?	wrote it in the waiting room of the hudson bay store . with somebody 's pekingese trying to climb into my lap . perhaps you 're right . perhaps i did n't mean it . all i know is that i 'm licked .
there 's a lot of water between vancouver and the u.s.a. this note is a suicide note . after you 're gone where would they look for you ? why would they look for you ? darkness , and open water , and a fast cabin cruiser . and i have a pocket full of money . and if i helped you , i 'd be committing a crime , or so they tell me .	that was n't why i called you . why did i hope -- when i had n't any right to hope ?
how bad is it ? bad enough for --	yes . i 've never been very far from it , for a long time . will you do something for me ?
take me where i have n't the courage to take myself .	how bad is the other thing ? the secret ?
this is the ace , betty . but not of spades . they 'll find out about the other . they might know already . and when they get this -- what would they look for ? where ? out there somewhere ?	they 'll look for you .
i run over to victoria . play some golf with some people i know . do it all the time . that 's why i have a cabin cruiser . custom- built.forty knots . mr clark brandon an almost gentleman of almost complete leisure . member of six golf clubs . broke 70 once on the shaughnessy heights course . you have to be good to do that , and if you look out of a front window of the empress hotel in victoria , in a few hours you can look right down on mr. brandon 's boat , the valkyrie . came alone ? sure . he always comes alone . mr brandon 's a rather lonely man .	and betty mayfield --
blonde , beautiful , and sad -- and nowhere . of course she might have run away -- if she knew how . and where to go . she might have dyed her hair . bleached it before probably . and changed her name again . but look at this note . and look at her room in the hotel . her stuff is all there . has n't a rag except what she stood up in . you do n't run away like that . not if you are young and beautiful . no chance .	but that 's what i 'm doing . could n't they think of that ?
if they had any reason to . why make it tough for themselves ? why go to all that trouble ? here 's an open book . close it . no reason to keep it open . she was a nice girl , anyway . and perhaps she did n't kill him on purpose . perhaps she did n't kill the other one . you never know . give her the benefit of the doubt . leave her stay where she is . close the book . finis .	killaine ...
you 'll be safe here . i wo n't be long . help yourself to anything you want . the galley 's through there . you can make coffee if you like .	this must have cost a fortune .
it did , but it never paid off -- until now . i ought to be back within an hour . we ca n't leave until near dark anyway .	do you have to leave the note ?
i 'd still go through -- even if i ended up in jail .	you would n't like it . i 've been there .
well ?	you leave it .
killaine 's wise . we ca n't wait any longer . here , put this on . but stay out of sight until we clear the harbor . i 'll tell you when .	killaine 's wise to what ?
see anything ?	i can still see the shoreline . the moon is rising .
cold ?	frozen .
i decided i did n't want a drink ... i 'm beginning to wonder .	wonder what ?
if you 're doing all this just for me .	that , and the fun of it .
i thought you had to be back to the hotel . to leave my -- my note .	that 's right .
funny , i never thought of you that way . you were so close too . we were all pretty stupid about you .	including killaine .
including killaine ... i still ca n't think of you that way .	i told you my father died in jail . he stole a fortune . most of it pretty dirty money . i do n't care to have that known .
in a way .	if it was an accident , you could have told the truth .
so could you . but our records were a little against us .	what your father did does n't condemn you .
nobody believed i was n't in on it . i was just a dumb-smart collage boy , and he was my father . i thought it was a legitimate business . he was a politician , with fingers in a lot of pies . i never saw the pies . they had names . for the record . innocent names . you know where that kind of money comes from , do n't you ?	the money that makes you mr. clark brandon . let 's you live in a penthouse , on top of the vancouver royal . lets you own a cruiser . lets you do as you please , go where you please . you big , open-handed , generous guy . that 's the kind of money it takes , is n't it ?
it buys things , just like any other kind .	that man that was following us last night -- he did n't come back this morning . i 'm beginning to wonder about him , too . was he really following me -- or you ?
no . i paid him off .	he 'll come back ... they always come back when you give them money .
not this one . and not mitchell .	you-killed-him ?
magruder obliged me . no use my saying it was n't planned that way . i had to clean up . i 'm not a dumb- smart college boy anymore . nobody in the world would believe i did n't plan the whole thing .	i guess i 'm a little screwy . maybe i could believe it . should i try ?
do n't go soft on me , baby . i 've got your note in my pocket . you wrote it , all by your own self . and i have to use it . it has to be found in exactly the right place .	so that i will never be found .
you 'll never make it . you 've out- smarted yourself .	i 'm still on course to victoria . nobody saw you get on board , nobody seen you since .
it was n't the time or place . do n't worry about the note , baby . i 'm playing for my neck now .	and i 'm begging for my life -- and yours .
mine ?	yes . yours . you have n't murdered anybody . you killed mitchell . was n't that an accident ? it must have been . if you kill a blackmailer , you kill him dead -- so that he ca n't talk anymore .
mitchell was dead enough .	and that nasty man that followed us last night . you did n't kill him .
who 'd believe it but you ? i took him out to sea and threw him in the water . even if they find him , what connects him with me ?	magruder does .
you think magruder wants to hang beside me ?	but the next one is murder . first the little step , then the longer step , and then the step you can never take back . you could tell about mitchell . you could tell about magruder -- and the detective . it would hurt , but you could do it . you could never tell about me .
would i want to ?	every day of your life you 'll want me . you 'll never get over it . every time you see your face in the mirror --
this is it , betty . they 'll find us again , fog or no fog .	if it has to be -- do you mind if i do it myself ? oh , i do n't mean with the gun . this is no trick . when i wrote that note you have in your pocket -- that was no trick either . it 's not so hard for me as you think . i 'm not crying about it , i 've been skating close to it for quite some time . the water is cold down there -- but so is everything else . and there 's you .
me ?	yes . you . you 're not really a murderer yet .
i think you mean that .	do you think i was faking ?
yes , miss .	i 'd like a dry martini . very dry , please .
sorry , miss . beer and ale only . canadian law .	beer ? well , all right .
beer or ale , miss ?	ale . i do n't mind .
mrs. west is a very emotional woman .	i do n't know her.. or particularly want to .
you probably know the type . you find them in hotels and resorts all over the world . they always have clothes , and money , and usually have had three or four husbands . they dress and enamel themselves with great care . they worry a great deal about those little lines at the corner of the eyes.. and they demonstrate their incompetence at the art of living bet getting mixed up with people like larry mitchell . tell me about yourself , miss mayfield .	i was born in new york city . i grew up . and here i am .
i 'll have to know a little more than that .	i 'm sorry , that 's all there is .
please answer my question .	you did n't ask a question . you made a speech .
that 's an evasion and you know it .	it is ?
well , that 's not getting us anywhere . you wo n't tell me who you are , or give any account of yourself . you wo n't even give me your address in the united states . why ? unhappy marriage ?	who told you i was married ?
your family coat of arms , mr. killaine ?	regimental ! seaforth highlanders .
i 'm sorry .	stop saying you 're sorry . i want information , not regrets .
what this ?	yes .
where 's you get it ?	a graduation present .
an unhappy marriage hardly seems a sufficient reason for that .	why do n't you arrest me and be done with it .
good morning , mr. killaine . i 'm sorry i ca n't give you the name of my bank -- because i have no bank at the moment . that was a crude trick .	they 're all crude , when they do n't work . had breakfast ?
care for a stroll outside ? beautiful morning . the air is like wine , the sky is a deep blue .	deep blue ? i 'd call it grey-blue .
florida ?	i 've never been to florida .
down below 's stanley park . on the other side of the trees , there 's a beach . you can see it . steveston 's over there . coast guard station . there 's the yacht club , and beyond it , the docks . the over on the other side of the inlet , there 's grouse mountain . it 's about 4000 feet high . there 's a restaurant on top of it . very nice restaurant . i 'm sorry we could n't have met in pleasanter circumstances , miss mayfield .	we would n't have met at all .
true . i was a bit irritable last night . i apologize .	you were a galahad , compared to some cops i 've known .
you 've had dealings with the police before ?	who has n't -- one way or another ?
but not in the investigation of a major crime , i hope .	is it a crime ?
we 're 98 per cent certain mitchell was murdered . there are a lot of reasons . was he very drunk when you last saw him ?	you were there when i last saw him .
i 'll find out , you know . perhaps not today -- perhaps not tomorrow . but in the end , i 'll find out .	the police always do , do n't they ?
i would n't make you talk about it . my job is the death of marry mitchell . why ca n't you give me your confidence ?	you -- or the vancouver police department ?
we try to be decent .	you 're a police officer . a very nice one -- but you have a job to do . i 'm a girl who 's in a jam , and it 's your job to keep me there . do n't go considerate on me . i might start to bawl .
you wo n't tell me who you are ? you wo n't even give me a chance to help you ?	nobody can help me . you , least of all .
if i understand what you meant by that .	you understand perfectly .
then there is n't much i can do , is there ?	there is n't anything you can do .
this is n't a very good place to talk .	i do n't want to talk .
i expected nothing else .	i might be able to save you . if i knew enough .
you would n't even try there must be some copper in you , or you would n't be an inspector .	there must be -- but when i 'm with you i ca n't find it .
i 'm about to be very silly . a man passes a girl on the street -- a very lovely girl -- his eyes meet her eyes , and something reaches out and takes hold of his heart -- and then she goes on and is lost in the crowd -- and he says to himself , `` there goes my lost love '' -- and it 's true -- if he never sees her again , it 's still true . of course , after a while , he forgets -- or almost forgets -- because after a while we forget almost everything . but this man is a copper . he gets orders -- routine orders -- to go to a place and investigate a murder -- and everything points to a certain girl .	points very straight to her .
he looks at the girl , looks into her eyes --	what does he see ?
palm trees against a sunset -- waves breaking on a coral reef -- the taj mahal by moonlight -- roses in an english garden , just after a shower -- clichs , one and all -- but good ones , with a lot of mileage left in them -- there 's one thing he does not see -- murder -- and murder was what he was sent to find . pretty ridiculous , is n't it ?	very ridiculous .
that 's my hard luck -- i 'm man enough to tell you about it -- and not be sorry .	what do your friends call you ? -- the ones that know you well ? -- and like you very much ?
they call me jeff .	jeff . shall we go now , jeff , and get it over with ?
not quiet yet . we know who the gun belonged to . margo west . she told us this morning . it does n't mean much . mitchell took it away from her . he had a habit of going through her bag .	looking for peanuts , i suppose .
so mitchell had handled it . afterwards , brandon picked it up . there 's no indication you handled it .	i always wear gloves when i shoot people . a bad joke -- but better than tears .
time 's up . i 'm off the case .	they 'll only find someone else -- who wo n't be so kind .
that 's something i ca n't spare you . but i wo n't do it myself .	because you think your in love with me ?
you 've got a couple of hours , maybe .	to do what ?
i ca n't answer that .	what will they do to you ?
that 's they 're business . can i drop you somewhere ?	you 're still a police officer , jeff . i saw you send those two men away . i know they were watching me .
what are you going to do -- toss your job into puget sound ? because i make you think of magnolias ? i thought policeman was something like a soldier . that his duty came first . however much he might happen hate it .	i 've been a soldier too . there is a difference . a policeman , like a judge , has a right to disqualify himself on proper grounds .
what proper grounds ? you ca n't be in love with me . you hardly know me . i 'm not in love with you .	i know that .
but even if you were in love with me .	there 's an empty taxi across the street . if you 're so anxious , take it . he 'll know the way to the police headquarters .
you do things the hard way , do n't you ?	sometimes .
not sometimes . always . just because it is the hard way . you 're that kind of man , jeff .	goodbye , betty .
he could have killed me a dozen times . you 'd never have known .	we know everything .
no , jeff . you do n't . he 's not a murderer , i tell you . he ; s not a murderer .	i hope he can prove it . come on . you do n't want to get pneumonia .
but i tell you -- -if you 'd only understand .	i understand , betty . i understand perfectly .
good morning , mr. brandon .	morning . any calls ?
mr. reed would like you to call him .	all right . get him .
and there 's a mr. goble to see you . says his business is personal .	who 's goble ?
mr. reed , please , for mr. brandon . very well . have him call . mr. brandon is in his office now . mr. reed stepped out , mr. brandon .	this way .
i 'd like a few words with you , in private .	i 'm not interested in blind dates .
nice friendly approach you 've got . goble . i could hardly walk when i got out of bed this morning .	you asked for it .
i 'm still asking . what do you want ?	i 'm not sure i want anything from you . you might want something from me .
name it .	information -- protection -- you might even want to hire me to go home and listen to the radio . that 's the funny part of my business -- once in a while , i get hired not to work . nice girl you were with last night . known her long ?
private eye ?	you guessed it . the card 's phony . i got plenty of 'em . different names , different jobs . i work out of san francisco . go anywhere , do anything . all it takes is the folding .
what are your rates ?	$ 40 a day and expenses . expenses run pretty high on a case like this . i 'm a long way from home . i do n't have a b.c . licence . i 'd need about $ 500 for a retainer .
what have you got on miss mayfield ?	mayfield ? oh , that girl you were with last night . you have n't hired me yet . mr. brandon .
that 's a nice hard knee you 've got , goble . how 'd you like to trade it for a broken neck ?	quit trying to scare me , mr. brandon , i 'm neurotic .
you hurt my feelings . i ought to raise the price to be a thousand .	if i call the police , your price will go down to a minus sign .
bluff . you 've waited too long .	for five hundred , what do i get ?
i go home and paint the kitchen .	for two hundred ?
i stick around and wait for the five hundred .	you mentioned information .
sorry . another client paid for that . you can hire me not to use it .	a thousand .
got it on you ?	got the information on you ?
there 's two hundred . i 'll meet you in an hour -- where we met last night	why not here ?
i do n't like your perfume in my office . make it somewhere else if you do n't like charlie 's .	charlie 's suits me fine . i do n't scare .
hi margo . hello killaine . you two come together ?	in the same elevator . it is a public conveyance .
let me introduce you . mr. killaine , mrs. west .	fascinated .
what 'll you have , margo ?	martini .
you make friends quickly , do n't you , clark ?	sometimes .
and without much discrimination .	leave that one lay .
i 'm sorry . this thing has just knocked me silly . how long do we have to wait for this police character ?	until he comes . he 's a nice guy . you 've met him .
all right , let 's see the buzzer .	what 's a buzzer ?
so you 're not a cop .	me a cop ? what made you think that , mr. brandon ?
who told you my name ?	i 've got good ears .
how are your teeth getting along ?	the new ones are fine . the last set i had gave me all kinds of trouble .
what 's this in favor of ?	i do n't like to be tailed . the lady i 'm with does n't like to be stared at . to put the matter in a couple of nutshells , i do n't like you .
what ?	a private joke .
it goes with this ... cold houses and warm drinks ... the effete englishman .	you 're not english .
that 's what i like about cocktail parties . everyone is so perfectly natural .	how 's life treating you ?
the usual grind .	round of golf saturday ?
would it have helped if i 'd knocked him down ?	hardly . who 's the girl ?
somebody mitchell picked up on the train . i do n't even know her name .	she does n't look like a girl who would let herself be picked up on a train .
thank you .	yes , i 've seen it before .
where ?	on miss mayfield 's balcony.. beside the chaise , i picked it up . do n't ask me why . i ought to know better .
could be .	i rather thought so . and before that , had you ever seen the gun ?
it was lying where on the balcony ?	near his right hand . about a foot away . perhaps more . good heavens , one does n't use a tape measure .
how about a cup of coffee ?	no thanks . i had some . how would you like to take a walk for , say , half and hour ?
how are you two getting along ?	delightfully . every time miss mayfield says something , i know less than i did before . well , i may as well knock off for tonight . good night , miss mayfield . do let me thank you for your cooperation .
in case you want to have us followed .	i do n't .
time for a little chat ?	if it does n't take too long . drink ?
thanks . lovely view you have , have n't you ?	i never notice the view after the first week .
i would . fancy waking up every morning with that in your lap . wonderful thing , money is . remember what somerset maugham said about it ?	i would n't know .
`` money is a sort of sixth sense that gives meaning to all the others . '' very appealing , especially to a poor man .	could we discuss that some other time ?
sure . let 's discuss betty mayfield . how long since you saw her ?	a couple of hours .
i have a warrant for her arrest .	that must hurt .
i 've always thought you were a pretty nice guy , brandon . i 'd like to go on thinking so . if you tried to help her get away --	would that make me a heel ?
you 'd be breaking the law .	does n't answer the question .
the only answer i have for you .	you passed up a dozen chances to arrest her . what toughened you up ?
information .	do n't kid me . you do n't think she murdered mitchell .
it could have been an accident .	that could be told .
not if she knew she would n't be believed .	your concentrating too hard , killaine . what about margo west ? she had a motive . i guess you know by this time whose gun it was ?
and old man clarendon ? he had a motive , too . margo and her money .	mitchell was killed down here . how could clarendon get in to do it ? or margo for that matter .
how could mitchell ? after that act he put on up here , is it likely she 'd let him in ?	she did n't have to . he could have climbed down from here .
mitchell was too drunk .	or just drunk enough . he was with her when she registered . he knew where her room was . you were out most of the evening . there was a lot of mess to clean up . waiters coming and going , the door standing open . suppose mitchell came in to grab a drink for himself , then wandered out on this balcony , then realized betty 's balcony was just below yours .
romeo in reverse . uh-uh . no sale , killaine .	you do n't buy it . okay . so i still want betty mayfield . where is she ?
no more for me , thanks . remember what i said . i ca n't interfere with the law .	where would she go , anyway . do n't tell me you have n't got her covered .
you forgetting the gag line , killaine . the police do n't take anything for granted .	i 'm afraid they do . far too often . so long .
you do a lot of real estate trading , brandon ?	now and then . mostly just for the fun of it .
i tried it once . i lost my shirt .	i buy my shirts by the dozen . fortunately .
i had a father who knew how to steal .	what ?
you asked me where it all came from .	oh . that was just one of those idle questions . one does n't expect an answer .
hello , mitchell . having fun ?	the liquors lovely . the rest of the party you can have .
what 's the matter , baby . do n't you like me anymore ?	lay off , ca n't you ?
do me a favor , mitchell . find yourself a nice secluded park bench .	did i do something wrong ?
i would n't know . just do it somewhere else . there is such a thing as good manners .	how would you know , brandon ?
want to walk out ... or get thrown out ?	you do n't throw guests out , brandon .
good afternoon , mr. campbell .	mr. mitchell .
a little something on account perhaps ?	rather more than a little something , mr. mitchell .
i think we 'd better discuss this in my office , mr. mitchell .	nothing to discuss . tomorrow the sun will shine even brighter . be grateful for small mercies .
i 'm getting positively haggard . in a couple of years people will be describing me as well preserved .	i see out friend larry mitchell is with us again .
so much less refined than frizzling them in the chair .	oh , shut up ! you have n't even got your spats on .
what are you doing here ?	i do n't think you locked your door .
what do you want ?	see how easy it is ? perhaps miss mayfield left her door unlocked . or if she did n't , there 's a passkey on every floor in the linen room . the head porter has a passkey . the bell captain has a passkey . the hotel 's full of passkeys .
passkey ?	or -- since one is a well-known and respected guest -- one could go to the desk in the lobby and say `` miss mayfield seems to have lost her room key -- have you another '' ? they always have another .
do n't be a fool . i loved him . he was n't worth it , but i loved him .	and now that he 's safe from all other women , you can go on loving him .
you nasty , sardonic --	sardonic , if you will my dear . bust nasty . you lied about the gun .
i 'm a very observant man . you had something in your bag this afternoon , something that causes you to hold it in a particular way . something that made a particular sound when you put it down on the bar . you went out with mitchell . none of us ever saw him again .	that 's not enough .
i saw your face this evening when the detective showed you the gun . you lied . it was obvious .	he saw my face too .
so he did -- but he has n't told you what he saw . i have .	they 'll arrest that girl . everything points to her .
one of these days , you 're going to wake up in the middle of the night and find that you 've cut your throat .	how clumsy . i 'd never forgive myself . good night my dear .
you could have got in that room , just as you got in here . how do i know you did n't kill larry ?	with what motive ?
nastiness . you 're nasty with words . why would n't you be nasty with deeds once in a while ? you hated him -- and i know why .	he was very easy to hate . if you 'll look in your mirror , when you are in a better temper- you 'll know why .
mr. clarendon , have you ever seen this before ?	i 'm sorry , inspector , i do n't know much about..
recently , then .	no , not recently . i 'm sure of that .
i need n't keep you any longer , mr. clarendon .	thank you . it is rather late ... and i 'm not young anymore . good night .
the harbor police have just picked up a dead man out of the water .	floater ?
not a floater . only just dead .	you 're the waterfront specialist . find out about it . i 've got a murder to investigate .
you have two murders to investigate . this man 's head was beaten in . and there 's nothing in his pockets .	drunk-rolling job . they hit him too hard .
i 've been on the waterfront detail for twelve years . this man had n't been dead an hour . he was n't killed last night . he was killed today . in broad daylight . that 's no drunk- rolling job .	let me know when you 've identified him
and do n't get too logical , driscoll . in police business it does n't work . i wish it did . but it does n't	i 'm an irishman , sir . an irishman is always logical .
got a moment , inspector ?	i 've got a year . or a second . i 'm not sure which .
we 've done that . he 's a san francisco private eye . name martin j. goble , g-o-b-l-e. had initials in his hat and for once he lived where he bought it . goble and greer is the firm name .	swimming with his hat on ? that 's original .
if you 'd seen the blood on his head -- and some body had to carry him out to sea --	i understand . pity to mess up a nice clean boat .
i got through to greer , his partner in the detective business . greer wo n't give out .	i 'd suggest a telegram . something like this : chief of police , san francisco . a licensed private detective named named martin j. goble , address so-and-so , has been found murdered within our jurisdiction . his partner , name something-something greer , refuses to give us any information . correction . refuses information necessary to our investigation . can you assist ? signed detective sergeant driscoll , vancouver , british columbia , police .
send that ?	would you ?
catch me at the vancouver royal if it 's important .	how important would it have to be ? it 's only murder , inspector .
the super 's just given me the sweetest dressing down i 've ever had . i 'm still reeling from it . and believe me , i had it coming . i apologize . what you think is important -- i think is important .	thanks , inspector . what are your orders about this wire to san francisco ?
what 's the face for , driscoll ?	magruder 's conked out . adrenaline injections , oxygen tent . he may come out of it and he may not . as a source of quick information , we ca n't forget him .
i 'm looking for mr. brandon .	the joint 's not open , mac . who 's brandon ?
i have an appointment with him , right here , right now .	go live in a tent .
it 'll be a tough dollar when guys like you learn the alphabet .	talk english . how do i know you 're you ?
mr. brandon could n't be here . he might have left something for you . what would it look like ?	one of those nice long manila envelopes -- sealed . not too fat- not too thin .
what do i get for it ?	you get it 's brother .
i need a receipt . sign your name across the flap .	open it and count it .
you in charge here ?	so it seems sergeant .
right .	i hate to pull rank on you sergeant , but once in a while ... for moral purposes ... you might address me as `` inspector '' . in moments of extreme desperation , you might even call me `` sir '' .
i knew him . he was easy to dislike , poor chap .	they tell me he 'll be a great loss to the liquor trade . this mayfield girl ...
... i supposed you knew her , too , inspector .	i 've met her .
pearl-handled .25 automatic , uh ? no , it 's a belgian gun ... 6.6 mm .	correct , inspector . a woman 's gun . u.s. 125 caliber ammunition in it . it was on a table in there .
this make of gun throws a shell backwards , high , and to the right . the chaise is only about four feet from the wall .	so the shell ought to have gone over ?
unless the gun was slanted up .	so the wound and the shell give you the same answer .
right . a clean deduction from observed facts . they 've got to be simple once in a while , inspector .	i 've always looked forward to it . all right , let 's get him out of here and tidy up .
she did n't seem the type to lam out -- even if she got the chance . that stuff was all gone through last night . anything special you 're looking for , inspector ?	i 'll know when i find it .
`` g.g . market one-eight-four-two . ''	gigi , huh ? sounds french -- one of those fancy ladies . must have been very fancy , if he scratched her phone number in gold .
that 's pretty risky business , inspector .	somebody did it twice last night -- in the dark .
not too hard , is it ?	maybe we 've been pretty dumb --
was that about the right angle ?	i think so .
where 's the shell ?	should be over there .
you 've got a dead man on your hands . you killed jim -- even if it was n't murder . what are you going to do about it ?	if i 've got any sense i 'm going to call headquarters .
they 'll probably believe you . but they 'll want to know what you were fighting about . why mitchell had a gun . you 'll tell them a simple story . they 'll pretend it sounds all right to them . now you 're headquarters . how does it sound to you ?	before i took the story and closed the case , i 'd want to know a lot more about these people . i 'd want to know just about everything about them .
exactly . now i 'm the killer . and there 's something i do n't want you to know . something that would destroy my comfortable life , rob me of my friends , my position .	such as ?
assume there is something to hid . i go to a lot of trouble . what do i do ? what would you do ?	do i know who lives down there ?
you can find out .	do i know that she 's out of the room ? likely to be out of it for some time ?
you can find out the first part . the second part you have to take a chance on .	pretty big chance , huh ?
this is the shell . what about the gun ?	well . what about it ?
i 've handled it . mitchell 's handed it . if i wipe it off , no suicide . if i take it out and lose it , no suicide . if i leave it here ... .no suicide .	so ?
how did he know he 'd get the chance ? he could n't have arranged it .	he could have tried . if he was up there in the dark , listening , he 'd know when she came home , know when she found mitchell dead , know what she did about it . if she telephoned , he 'd probably hear that .
and she did give him the chance , the way it worked out .	if she did n't -- if luck was against him -- he wipes the gun off , reaches the wall up there -- drops it on the chaise .
no suicide .	did we ever really think it was suicide ?
you win , inspector . you win all along the line . why did n't we think of brandon before -- or did we -- some of us . yeah . of course you did . when a suspect thinks he 's safe , you go on letting him think he 's safe . wait for a mistake .	and a motive -- which we have n't got . so this could all be a dream .
greer and goble in the call building , san francisco . just like you thought ... two murders in two days . different places , different methods , different people . nothing connects them , but a telephone number .	a think wire -- -but very , very strong . let 's get out of here .
oh , the coldstream guards . do n't you take your hat off in elevators ?	i never wear a hat . oh , so i am . i forgot . i guess i 'm terribly sorry again , mrs. west .
may you what ?	oh nothing .
scotch and plain water , i think .	warm water , no doubt .
i never saw it before .	positive ?
what about me ?	not quiet yet .
you knew mitchell pretty well , did n't you , mrs. west ?	i was in love with him ... which shows you the quality of my brains . why do n't you ask her about the gun ?
i shall . from your knowledge of mitchell , would you say he would be likely to commit suicide ?	anybody could commit suicide , if he felt low enough . i 've felt it myself .
then why not give miss mayfield the benefit of the doubt ?	i 'd be delighted to ... anytime you can show me the doubt . i 'll wrap it up in tissue paper and put a christmas seals on it for her .
remember that time , did n't i ? good morning mrs. west . does your visit here mean you 've changed your mind ?	how did you know ? clarendon . you cops never tell anybody anything , do you .
other people always know so much more than we know -- so much more than they 're willing to tell us .	it was clarendon . he knew i had the gun in my bag .
you could n't possible have traced it this soon -- not possibly .	of course not . thanks for telling me . i have n't seen mr. clarendon .
i am a fool .	that depends upon your motive . you were in love with mitchell , were n't you ?
yes -- and he 's already becoming vague to me . funny ! last night i was furiously jealous . jealous of what ? i out that gun in my bag deliberately . who was i going to kill with it ? a girl i did n't even know ? a man i knew to be a thief and a forger ? a half-man ? a gigolo ? it 's already ludicrous . love ! what a comedy !	you did n't play it for laughs last night .
did you ever have a serious operation ?	mortar shells are not funny , either .
at first , it does n't hurt at all . that 's shock . then it hurts terribly -- you would n't believe such pain could exist -- and six months later you ca n't remember what pain felt like . it has n't taken six months this time . it has n't even taken twenty- four hours . is that a beastly thing to say ?	not if it clears the air .
it does . may i go now ?	i 'll investigate mr. clarendon 's financial position --
i do n't understand .	perhaps a rich widow would have solved all his problems .
now , you 're being beastly .	sure . you did n't come here in person just to tell me about the gun . you wanted me to be looking across the desk at you while you talked about mitchell . if i believe you , it would be psychologically impossible for you to have killed him last night .
and if you did n't believe me ?	you would still have planted information that clarendon knew about the gun -- and not as an accusation , but in the process of defending yourself by making a confession . very neat . good morning , mrs. west .
yes , i think so . here are two glazed manila envelopes . one is the bag type . the other one had the money in it . do n't ask me how i know . i know .	i 'm interested in who handled it .
no doubt about that one .	how about magruder ?
he checks too .	that leaves two strangers .
so far .	try betty mayfield . the mitchell case .
mayfield ? she fit into this ?	she might .
you 'll have to take my word for it . we do n't make slides until we have perfect prints for comparison .	i 'll take your word .
this gun permit was issued to clark brandon ?	the card says so , does n't it ?
killaine , this is mr. mitchell , senior . young mitchell 's father . he just flew in from toronto .	how do you do , sir .
i 've explained the situation to mr. mitchell up to a point . now about this mayfield girl ?	she 's a suspect , naturally . but not the only one .
no .	i hear she 's a very pretty girl .
which forces me to arrest her against my better judgment .	aye . you have a point there .
am i to interpret that as an order to arrest miss mayfield ?	when i give an order , you 'll not need it interpreted . you have an hour to make your mind up . well , are ye satisfied , mr. mitchell ?
are you a policeman or a soft-headed nincompoop ?	a little of both , sir , and perhaps not quiet enough of either .
it wo n't look pretty good on your record , killaine . where 's the girl now ?	i do n't know , sir .
well , find out . who 's covering her ?	nobody 's covering her , i detached the officer assigned to that duty .
this girl is a murderess , killaine .	i disagree , sir . as inspector in charge of the case i have the right to form that opinion , the right to act on it .
ye have , have ye ?	we lifted seven fairly good prints from miss mayfield 's toilet articles . washington ought to teletype us within a few hours .
and in the meantime this girl goes where she pleases , does what she pleases ?	yes , sir .
`` superintendent j. mckechnie , vancouver police department . vancouver b.c . replaying to your e.p . teletype classification no . 2684 incomplete . we advise identification possible . elizabeth kinsolving , arrested greenwater , north carolina , january 8 , 1948 , on a charge of murder . signed , fbi. , washington , d.c. h. cleary , inspector in charge .

'' she bleached her hair , or course . would your sensibilities be offended , if i sent out a general alarm to pick up this girl ?	i think you 'd be entirely justified , sir .
but you still think she 's innocent .	i do .
i believe you won decorations during the war .	two .
there are people in this world who do n't think a police badge is a badge of honor . i 'm not one of them .	nor i. this is why i gave it to you .
you 're a young man . you 're romantic . you think a pretty face and a clean conscience go together . you think a soft voice means a soft heart . you 'll grow out of that .	not too far , i hope .
get out of here !	what are my orders , sir ?
i 'm afraid you 're not very glad to see me , margo .	with your charm ? how could i help it ? have a nice trip ?
so-so .	who 's the girl ?
her name 's mayfield . betty mayfield .	nice .
she 's just a girl i met on the train . you do n't mind do you ?	why should i mind ?
you should n't . you washed me up very thoroughly .	as thoroughly as i could . it was n't easy . but you are helping me .
margo , darling . you washed me up . remember ? we 're just friends . you wanted it that way .	she 's very beautiful . she 's much younger than i am . and she 's rich , i hope .
rich ? i have n't the faintest idea . why ?	you ought to know why .
i do n't . my hunch is she 's just torn up an unhappy marriage . i was able to do her a small favor .	splendid . now she can return the compliment .
i hoped to get enough to cover them before they cleared . i was n't lucky .	you know what would happen to you if i turned these over to the police ?
i have a rough idea .	you 'd go to jail . for a long term .
what 'll we do about it , margo ?	she is much younger than i am . that 's something i 'm going to have to get used to . is n't it , larry ? they 'll all be much younger than i am . here . tear them up .
i 've always been a heel . i guess i always will be .	you do n't have to make a pose of it .
it 's the only pose i have left . i 'm sunk . broke . i do n't even have my hotel bill .	i seem to recognize this routine . first the kiss then the touch . oh , what 's the use . you 're you .
i seem to remember that you like to help yourself .	that 's not very kind .
what 's this ?	what does it look like ?
how long have you had it ?	years , why ?
it 's against the law to cross the border with a gun . the canadian police might like to know about this .	you already have the checks , darling .
i did n't mean it that way i 'm sorry .	oh , forget it . clark brandon 's throwing a party up in his penthouse this evening . take me ?
of course .	how about your new friend ?
i told you she 's just..	a girl you meet on the train . excuse my bringing it up again . be back in an hour . right ?
right .	in an hour , larry .
i 'm sorry . i forgot about calling for you .	it 's quite unimportant , mr. mitchell . after all , you got what you wanted .
be nasty .	i have no intension of being nasty , mr. mitchell .
she is beautiful . and young . no thank you .	i say yes !
you 're very attractive , my dear . and you look very unsophisticated .	unsophisticated ? if i knew about this babe ...
mr. penfield . i am sorry to have kept you .	it 's kind of you to see me .
he 's a little unhappy . i hope he was n't a nuisance ?	he was delightful .
my first husband worked for the bbc . i doubt if anyone there remembers him now , just another long dead diligent administrator . he would have been useful in the fight to preserve the bbc 's independence during the suez crisis - one of the few things he was passionate about . i became involved too . i started work on a book that would have been published on the tenth anniversary of suez . then he died , and i loots the will to write it . by the time i was over his death , other books had been published , and it was n't worth going on .	what a shame .
it was n't much more than a pot boiler.suez was very important for our generation . i did n't want it to be forgotten . and that 's why i 'd like to be able to help you . but really mr. penfield , i looked through my notes before you came , they 're all very much out of date , there 's been so much published since . i do n't think i 'm your man .	well , i am a great admirer of your work . i read your books on chartism when i was still at school . i 'm a journalist , not a historian . there are questions of method , and approach . i wondered --
i see . are you a socialist , mr. penfield ?	yes .
my husband apologises for not joining us . it 's not too cold for you , mr. penfield ?	it 's fine , thank you .
since you are a friend of my daughter 's , i think i 'm entitled to call you james , do n't you think ?	please do . i was beginning to wonder who this mr. penfield was .
to ann .	to james . i remember what it was i was going to say . we were talking about forgetfulness . the czech writer kundera has one of his characters say that the struggle of man against tyranny is the struggle of memory against forgetting .
history books are first onto the bonfires .	if we leave the remembering to historians then the struggle is already lost . everyone must have a memory , everyone needs to be a historian . in this country , for example , we 're in danger of losing hard-won freedoms by dozing off in a perpetual present .
here i am lecturing you . have some pt .	thanks .
so i can go ahead and be a historian without feeling like a poseur.i shall be fulfilling a citizen 's duty .	if you like . but do n't be too modest , james . the citizen 's duty is to remember , not necessarily to write books . you are highly qualified . you 're a responsible journalist doing what sounds to me like a very demanding job . every day you take decisions that depend on your sense of history . a genuine tyranny would have to get rid of people like you .
you 're kind to be so encouraging .	i think you 'll do very well .
i do worry about susan . have you known her long ? she has n't mentioned you .	actually , we 've only just met . but we 're quiet good friends .
it 's a pity she could n't make it up here today .	yes .
she 'll be here next weekend . why do n't you come too , james ? i 'll * show you the marshes properly . if you 're lucky you might even see the first of the geese arriving from siberia .	well , i 'd hate to be a nuisance .
thank you .	we 'll see you next week , and if --
the references are to hansard or to newspapers . i have n't got the actual speeches now . you 'll have to chase them up .	i will , thanks .
hello . anyone for a walk ? tom is n't , i can tell you .	well , we were just ...
shall we go ?	yes .
then i began to listen to what the well-off were saying about the poor now the war had just ended , and the language was much the same as it had been before the first reform act . a small minority thought that england was really theirs , they had made it , they owned it . the rest , the wage earners , were foreigners , outsiders intent on wrecking it all .	did n't evelyn waugh say that the country under atlee seemed to be under enemy occupation ?
did he ? i left school and worked for the labour party . my older brother , george , had just been killed in greece , and he 'd been an active member . i hero-worshipped him . he was 25 years old ... it was an exciting time for us , those first couple of years after the war . we thought the country was about to become a true democracy . i can understand why people of your generation want to write about that time . they feel betrayed . they want to know what went wrong .	what went wrong ?
thank you .	sit on that log , dear .
now first of all , tell us your name .	penfield . james penfield .
but i 'm not an interviewer or a correspondent .	that does n't matter . as long as we can get our message through to someone there . jill , where are those handouts ?
give them here . this tells you how the women 's peace camp came to be set up . all local women at first , then we had support from women and men all over the country .	very good .
terrific .	but what we need is national coverage . it 's difficult with this falklands madness going on . do you think you might be able to do something when you get back ?
charles ! i did n't know you were back . have a good holiday ?	not too bad , thanks . how have you been ?
working hard on that book i was telling you about . coming to the meeting ?	i 'm not sure i can face it .
how 's mary ?	she 's fine . well , actually we 've broken up . it 's all over .
no . that 's terrible , charles . what happened ?	look , i 'd rather you did n't ask me questions . i ca n't talk about it .
aha . james giving some woman the old heave-ho .	exactly that .
it 's terribly good .	do n't tell me you 've actually read it , jeremy .
committed to memory . forever .	i see .
attributed ?	of course .
why , is there a new foreign secretary ? who was the old one anyway ?	it need n't concern you , edward . james has got some news . he needs a poet 's advice .
congratulations . who with ?	a glamorous young lady way above his station ...
i know , i know ! gentlemen , let me introduce you to one of our most talented contributors to the cold war . james penfield . he wrote the opening chapter , on 'the berlin airlift ' . one of the best chapters in the book .	hello .
would you like a dessert ... i 'm having one .	no thanks . i 'd like to break away --
i 'll have some of that .	... break away completely from --
and some of that . sorry .	... from all the moralising and talk of national humiliation that is now the standard line on suez ...
yes ... you 're not a socialist then ?	no . i 'd want to --
good .	i 'd want to set out events as they happened . the way i see it is this : the british empire was an ideal . it may have become totally obsolete by the middle of this century , but it was n't totally dishonourable to try and defend its remains and try and salvage some self-respect , which is what i think the conservatives were trying to do . then there 's the essential --
are you going to have coffee ?	yes , please .
and you 'll join me in a sambucca ?	thank you .
personally james , i 'm very excited by this new arrangement we have . it gives us direct access to literally hundreds of american collages . twentieth century history is a growth area over there , do n't ask me why . your readership will be first and second year american collage students ...	freshman and sophomores ...
you know the lingo . jolly good . so your language will have to be simple , not stupid , mind , but simple , very , very simple , and always remember it 's an american readership .	like i was saying , the american angle in suez is very important . i would n't want to say they let us down . i think that 's wrong . a good ally is one who does n't back you up in your mistakes , who tells you when to pull back . and the americans were good allies . simple as that .
james ... i ca n't begin to tell you how pleased we all are . congratulations , and i really mean it .	thank you .
it 's everything we wanted . a very good read . a terrific piece of work . so , here 's to you and suez .	and to history .
so it 's all worked out perfectly ...	that 's her .
was that your chapter , then ? it was very good .	thank you . we met last week , at the wajda film . you wo n't remember . we did n't actually speak .
can i give you a lift ?	no , it 's all right . i can get a cab . night night .
what did you think of that wadja film ?	i quite liked it . i was n't as enthusiastic as everyone else .
i thought it was tremendous .	i think it went on rather too long .
i could n't bear for it to end .	and i did n't like that man .
oh , but he was terrific .	and the shape of it all . it was sort of ... shapeless .
really ? i thought those long flashbacks were extremely good .	you do n't like flashbacks because your mother 's a historian .
good theory . but i like my mother . i have no aversions to what she does .	too bad . what did your father do ?
everyone describes the same process . at first it is exciting . you 're at the centre of the world . as soon as anything happens , you 're the first to know about it . and there are deadlines a dozen times a day , even more , and that 's intimidating and exciting . then you get the hang of it and the excitement wears off . your a clerk in a rather dowdy office . there 's none of the glamour of television , or the penetration of serious journalism . you 're a processor of semi-official news . some people leave at this stage . then , if you hang on , and especially if you 're promoted , you discover a new kind of pleasure . you 're pleased by the ease with which you can write summaries and bulletins from news agency printouts , by the way you ca judge length . ending a broadcast on the dot , having everything run smoothly , selecting a running order that makes sense , knowing instinctively what you can and can not do . professionalism .	and you 're at this third stage
no , there 's a fourth . numbness . you do everything right , but you feel nothing either way .	i think you 're exaggerating . and if you are n't , you should jolly well change your job .
oh yes ?	yes . you 're much too old to making a drama out of alienation , or whatever you call it . you 've got to take responsibility for your own happiness . that 's what i think anyway .
mummy and i , we were more like lovers , really , or sisters . then a couple of years after daddy died , and not long after i left oxford , she started seeing various men and i was furious . i really was upset . i stopped going home . i never phoned . i went round telling everyone how awful her books were . and she hardly seemed to notice , and that made me angrier . then i got a job i was interested in , and i started to see lots of men , and i suppose i grew up a little and began to understand . so i wrote her a long letter , almost seven pages , saying how sorry i was , and how i was worried that we were drifting apart . and do you know , she wrote me a poem , a really beautiful poem about mothers and daughters .	how nice .
it makes me weepy just to remember it . so we were fine again , and then she got married to matthew who 's a womaniser and a bit of a yob , but quite nice really , makes tv commercials . what about yours .	both dead .
damn . they 're early .	who ?
i called you a taxi .	very thoughtful .
again ?	yes , if you like . call me at work .
why not stay ?	i have to be up early .
me too .	two or three years ago i would have stayed . and fucked you .
you do n't trust me .	i do n't trust anyone . that 's what comes of working in television .
in radio we 're different .	i bet . thanks for the drink .
i might see you in norfolk over the weekend .	you just might .
i think we 're ready now , thank you . and how was norfolk ? did you get on with my mother ?	i think she liked me .
did she talk about me ?	no . we talked about history , and siberian geese .
do you think she 's invited you up for her sake or for mine ?	i have n't really thought about it .
i have n't seen much of you .	no . it 's a bit of a madhouse . for some reason a lot of my mother 's friends specialise in monologues .
look , will you come on a walk with me tomorrow ?	i might .
might ?	yes . might . remember , you 're here to talk to my mother .
jeremy phoned this morning	what did he want ?
he 's making plans for brighton . he thought we could travel down together .	that 'll be fun
in your car	why not .
shall we have a drink or something ?	oh ... excuse me . there 's nicholas .
we do n't seem to get much time to talk .	i know . i 'm sorry .
not here .	to the airlift .
to the airlift .	any sign of the goddess barrington ?
not yet you know any of these people ?	one or two . a grey lot . some social democrats . some diligent anti-communists . a political section man from the us embassy . and this exquisite californian wine , courtesy of the cia .
blas and epicene .	we were just chortling over that . blas and epicene . it perfectly describes the new foreign secretary . so -- i hope you do n't mind , edward , i pinched it for my piece today .
c'mon . i do n't want any jones about this .	no jokes . james is in love .
bastard .	name so susie barrington . daughter of the eminent historian , anne barrington , step-daughter of the scandalous matthew byrd the acclaimed sack-artist ...
to the fleet .	to the fleet .
and the argies .	the argies .
now , top secret file .	come on . hand over .
uh-huh . tell me what you think of this first .	it 's shit .
you approve !	let me see .
get way . you 'll see when i 'm ready . first i want you to reflect on my noble behaviour , on how your interests are closest to my heart , how i lay awake at night worrying --	jeremy , just let me see what you 've got .
you 're so hard . all right then . i was chatting to some people from the diary page , and the name of barrington came up . i expressed an interest ...	oh yes .
... an innocent interest , and found out that last year vogue ran a series called 'mothers and daughters ' number seven , anne and susan barrington . being a decent loving friend i went to the files and made a copy for you .	let me see .
she 's never written a book in it , but she clearly knew a lot .	mmm ...
it 's obvious what you have to do . your way into the daughter 's pants is through the mother , up the suez canal ...	you 're so gross .
she 's very nice , apparently . lives in norfolk . and very left-wing . you 'll have to watch yourself there .	ha ha ...
according to this , the daughter goes up to stay quiet often . you 'll need to get yourself invited for the right weekend .	you 've really got it all worked out , have n't you ?
that 's enough of that .	we 've been playing ten minutes for christ sake .
what have you been up to ?	well , everyone 's desperate for a new falkland 's angle . purdy 's come up with a real dog . worker 's rights in argentina . so i 've been running round getting people to do things . but no one 's keen . workers rights . when did anyone on that paper give a damn about workers rights ? i said to purdy , `` look , tits , bingo , jingo , horoscope , sport , celebs , gossip and the occasional firm stand on -- ''
the torture of small children --	on the torture of very small children , but do n't start telling them about their rights --
hold those rights .	tame those rights ... you know , we 're even freighting in a couple of exiled argie trade unionists from paris for a tv tie in . one of them had his balls tap-danced on by the secret police . the other one had to be hosed off the wall of his cell after the police -- yes my good man ?
fortunate that i was here to keep susan entertained .	sorry . got held up . what are you doing here ?
delivering gossip and goodwill . it seems we 'll both be doing brighton . perhaps you should come too .	will it be fun ?
perhaps i will , then .	i 'm off . let 's meet . you promised to tell me about norfolk .
still in love ?	i 'm not sure .
six onion bajees ! great girl . did you shake the mother off ?	yes , finally .
big mistake , i think . you might have learned a lot .	are you up to something ?
susan and i are very old friends , james .	fuck off .
and you were obviously getting nowhere with her . i was waiting for the right moment to tell you that .	my god . you even cooked up that norfolk trip .
it might have worked . really . i would have been delighted for you if it had . but she was n't interested . not my fault .	you 're a piece of shit
hello .	hello .
i 'm waiting for your mother .	she said awfully sorry , make yourself comfortable , she wo n't be long . .
thanks .	why not sit down and wait ?
okay , i will .	she 's not my mother , anyway . my mother 's in italy .
oh , i see .	have you come to talk about me ?
what period ?	suez . 1956 .
do you want to hear my list of english kings and queens ?	all right .
it goes from henry viii . henry viii , edward iv , mary , elizabeth i , james i , charles i , charles ii , james ii , william and mary , ann , george i , ii , iii and iv , victoria , edward vii , george v , edward viii , george iv , elizabeth ii .	what about the cromwells ?
wait ... and with talks at the united nations still making little progress , tension and anxiety settled on mps of all parties in westminster . speaking on the jimmy young show earlier today , mrs thatcher said the prospects of a peaceful solution did not look encouraging . what is it ?	take a look at these .
not bad .	fifteen news items . i got exactly the same running order as the bulletin desk . they 're all old pros .
it 's that lady from norfolk again .	i 'm not here .
i 'm terribly sorry . he does n't seem to be here ... no ... yes , if i see him , i will . .. goodbye . she 's going to phone back .	next time tell her i 've gone away .
hello , jimmy .	dad .
so how is she ?	well , she does n't complain much . you know what she 's like . she keeps asking when you 're coming ...
i 'm sorry about saturday , dad . it was just impossible to get away .	oh she knows you 're very busy , especially now , with everything going on ... the doctor said to try her on solids , but she 's been right off her food ... you take this up to her . tell her you made it . she 'll like that .
everyone 's been marvellous really , jimmy . the neighbours come and sit with her while i 'm at work .	that 's good .
and joe ramage - do you remember him ? he comes and helps out in the shop .	yes , you said .
now , are you going to have some more tea ?	no , thanks dad .
i 've got to be going . i 've got a meeting tonight .	the bed 's all made up if you want to stay .
i just might give you a ring when we get back to london . there 's one or two things i 'd like to ... will you let me have your number before you leave ? have you ever watched a commercial being made ?	no .
i 'll tell you another thing . we might have led the world once into the industrial revolution , now we lead with television commercials . we 're the best , it 's as simple as that . even the americans will admit it now ... the camera work , the acting , the scripts , special effects . we 've got the lot . nearly all the good directors here have ambitions to make serious films . that food you 're eating .	yes .
what would you call it ?	i dunno . ploughman 's lunch .
ploughman 's lunch . traditional english fare .	u-huh .
susan told me that your visits to norfolk had ... well , an ulterior motive .	she said that ?
you were n't really interested in suez at all . incredibly enough , you were interested in my wife .	now listen ...
jeremy ! how fantastic .	darling susan .
you 're so famous now .	and you 're so beautiful . what are you doing here ?
we 're thinking of doing this current affairs thing for schools . world history since 1945. twelve programmes , lots of stock film .	in that case , you should meet my very dear friend , james penfield . brilliant analyst of recent history and a world authority on the berlin airlift .
it was last year .	we might be able to dig out a couple of suez survivors for you .
darling susan . you look like an angel . but where 's your hat ?	oh no !
do n't point it at james !	voila !
what have you got there ?	you 'd look naked without one .
we 'll see what we can do .	promise ?
it was incredible . he came back , made a pompous little bow and said , 'my dear girl you may film me all afternoon if you wish . ' and he 's promised not to talk to the press .	it 's because he desires you . the women get all the breaks at these conferences .
it 's true ! i was here last year doing a piece , remember ? i was in the bar with all these northern trade unionists and their sponsored mps . they were all incredibly fat and beery , huge trousers and braces . and so sweet . they all stood round me like children saying 'you ! working for television ? you 're just a young thing . ' they would n't let me buy drinks even when i told them the programme was paying . they kept looking at my pass which was pinned here and saying 'oo , can i ? '	then one of them was sick all over your new dress .
do n't close the door . do n't turn out the hall light .	i wo n't . goodnight .
ah , susy , it ...	tom . .. bed ! go on .
do n't you want to walk , tom ?	no .
something happened . you got nuked in the last quarter .	yeah , my knee got folded about 90 degrees the wrong way .
and that 's why you never went pro ?	two years of surgery . i missed my window . limped through law school instead .
mmm . a lawyer , huh ? too bad . but at least you 're surfing now . so your life 's not over yet , right ?	not yet .
friends of yours , huh ?	the one you decked is bunker wiess . the big one is his brother , warchild . the other two always hang . they think they 're some kinda death squad around here .
what 's their program ?	they 're punks . nazis . their brains are wired wrong . they hurt surfing because they give nothing back , and they have no respect for the sea . they just want to get radical . it 's mindless aggression . they 'll never get it , the spiritual side of it .
you always talk like this ? you 're not gon na start chanting or anything are you ?	no . so i was up the beach . i saw it going down . you did n't hesitate ... they never backed you up an inch . that 's rare in this world .
thanks for stepping in .	de nada .
gon na be some people at my house tonight . maybe you can make it .	where ?
do n't you gamble ?	only make bets i ca n't afford to lose . only way to be 100 % committed .
so what 's the biggest ? waimea ?	no , bells beach , australia .
i got ta be fucking crazy .	yeah , but are you crazy enough ?
football 's a man-made game . you keep score with numbers . but in this , there 's no field , no rules , no opponent . just you and the wave .	i know that part . tell me something i can use , here .
i 've watched you once or twice . you surf like it 's some kind of street fight . you jerk along from moment to moment , fighting everything that comes at you . always trying to win .	a flaw i 'm working on .
the only way to win out here is to surrender . you have to feel what the wave is doing , accept its energy , get in sync . just feel it all moving in the blackness ... you do n't need to see .	yeah , right , vision is highly over- rated .
how you figure ?	news , last night ... those guys , the ex-presidents ... they robbed my bank yesterday . and i was just there the day before , cashing a check . see ... look . assured trust ... same place .
one shot stopping .	'one shot stopping ' ... good , very good . i like you , johnny . i like you because you 'll sacrifice anything to win . i respect that . it elevates you a little above the drones who have learned compromise . here , hold it . check out the weight .
ever done this before ?	once .
pure adrenalin , right ? ! the ultimate rush . other guys snort for it , jab a vein for it -- all you got ta do is jump .	sure , it 's a blast , but listen , i sorta screwed up my knee yesterday --
it 's a little ceremony we always have at the end of summer . one last speedstar .	so , who ... uh , who packed my chute ?
i did . what 's the matter ? do n't trust me ?	you got ta earn trust .
we gon na jump or jerk off ?	my man !
utah , you copy bruddah ?	whoooaaah ! shhiiittt ! whoooaaah !
you gon na pull ?	after you , alfonse . i insist !
do n't screw around man , pull it !	you do it ... you first !
one thousand feet . pull the goddamn cord !	you first !
what 's this ?	insurance policy . now this is going to sting a bit , but it 's for your own growth , brah . press play .
you 're a fucking dead man --	whoa , whoa ! ! think it through ! i 'm the only one knows where they are . just let me talk for a second .
talk .	she 'll be fine , rosie wo n't do anything . at least not as long as i meet him at a certain place and time , about ... let 's see ... ... six hours from now .
you call him ... right now ... and tell him to let her go .	sorry , ca n't do it , brah . he 's on the road . and where they 're going there 's no phones . damn , i hate this johnny , i really do . i hate violence . see , that 's why i need rosie . i could never make this thing work , myself . no way i could hold a knife to tyler 's throat , man ! she was my woman , once . we shared time in this world . but rosie , he 's kind of a ... mechanism . once you set him in motion , he wo n't stop . that 's his gift , a kind of ... blankness . noon comes , straight up , he 'll gut her like a pig and try not to get any on his shoes . nothing i can do , unless i get there .
we 're wasting time .	see ! that 's what i like about you , man ! you 're just sharp as a razor blade .
i ca n't do this .	sure you can ! you may even like it ... it 's a killer rush . you 'll see . hey , do n't i show you things , johnny u ?
bodhi , this is your wake up call , man -- i ... am ... an ... eff ... bee ... eye ... agent ! !	wild , ai n't it ? ! see , we exist on a higher plane , you and i. we make our own rules . why be a servant of the law johnny u ... when you can be it 's master ?
i 'm not armed .	but you 're not alone .
where 's roach ?	around somewhere . listen , i 'm in kind of a hurry , johnny u. what can i do for you ?
you got ta tell me where she is .	and let my policy expire ? sorry .
look , bodhi man . people are dead . the ride is over .	i say when it 's over !
why should i ?	what if your chute fails , bodhi ? rescind the order . let her off the hook , she 's served her purpose . do it , man , you owe me that much . let me hear it before you check out .
pretty radical , johnny . even for you . why do n't you pull it ?	no games , bodhi . pull the cord ! now ! !
go on , johnny . pull it . but you got ta drop the gun , first ! right ? ! you use your other hand what you gon na hold on with ?	pull it right now or i 'll blow your fucking head off and pull it myself !
three seconds ... two ... one ...	shit ! !
wild ride , huh ?	jesus christ , bodhi !
and i always knew i could count on you , agent utah .	i 'm not fbi anymore .
you never were ...	i asked them to give me a couple minutes ...
yeah ? what ?	have you seen a little dog ? kind of a cockapoo lookin ' thing . about this big .
you sure he is n't out back ? you mind if i go take a look ?	look , i do n't know anything about your dog , okay --
well is there anyone else here that might have seen him ?	there 's nobody else here ...
you know less than nothing . if you even knew that you knew nothing , at least that would be something , but you do n't .	yes , sir .
eating solid breakfasts , utah ?	sir ?
all the food groups ? avoiding sugar ? caffeine ? i see to it that my people maintain cardiovascular fitness . we stay off hard liquor , cigarettes ...	i take the skin off chicken .
this is us . bank robbery . and you 're in the bank-robbery capital of the world --	1322 last year in la county . up 26 percent from the year before .
that 's right . and we nailed over a thousand of them . we did it by crunching data . good crime-scene work , good lab work , good data-base analysis . nobody had to tackle a car once . you getting the signal , special agent ?	zero distortion , sir .
you 're a real blue-flame special , are n't you , utah ? i do n't know why they sent you to la . must be an asshole shortage .	not so far .
how was the beach ?	fine .
surf conditions okay ?	a little mushy .
a little mushy ! you think the taxpayers would like it , utah , if they knew they were paying a federal agent to surf and pick up girls ?	babes .
what ?	the correct term is babes , sir . uh , this type of undercover operation is entirely dependent on picking up the idiom of the speech . otherwise penetration is not possible , sir . of the social infrastructure , i mean .
special agent utah , this is not some job flippin ' burgers at the drive-in . yes , the surfboard bothers me . yes , your approach to this case bothers me . and yes , you bother me . you two have produced squat in the last two weeks , during which time the ex- presidents have robbed two more banks ! ! do you have anything even remotely interesting to tell me ?	caught my first tube this morning .
three men dead . one of them a cop . how 's that sit in your gut , utah ?	take your hand off my shoulder right now .
they found the drop car up on mulholland . i want you two to go work it .	what ? now i 'm working the drop car ? who 's handling the scene here ?
cole and munoz ? i been on this case for two years .	that 's the point , is n't it ?
yeah , i get it . time to play let 's dick the old guys , huh , harp ?	supervising special agent , harp . now i want you to go work the drop car , okay , angelo ? okay ?
look , harp . do n't turn him over to the uniforms like some punk . let me ride him in .	yeah , sure . why not ? you two screw-ups deserve each other . that 's why i put you together in the first place . christ pappas , you 're as bad as he is ... talk about the blind leading the blind --
harp , let me tell you something . i was an agent in this bureau when your mommy was still wiping your shinny pink ass , and you know one thing i learned in all those years that you still have n't ?	what that ?
added to which indignity , i got three months left to retirement and they saddle me with some blue-flamer fresh out of quantico for a partner . some quarterback punk , johnny unitas or something .	the shit they pull , huh ?
pappas . angelo pappas .	punk . quarterback punk .
good move .	yeah , they control the room well . stick strictly to the cash drawers .
they do n't go for the vault ?	never go for the vault . they never get greedy .
smart . you burn time in the vault .	reagan usually drives . stolen switch car , they leave it running at the curb , looks parked from a distance . when they run , they dump the vehicle and vanish . and i mean vanish .
surgical . look at them separate the dye packs . dick and ronny know their jobs .	the ex-presidents are the best i 've seen , kid .
you through , mr. wizard ? let me know if you find jimmy hoffa under the seat while you 're at it . hell , it 's only 7:30. the night 's still young ... you can solve this case and start on another one .	well , what 're your ideas on these guys ?
forget about it , kid . they 're ghosts . let the goddamn yuppie mormon affirmative action assholes handle it . see i 'm almost 55 ... so i must be senile , right ? they better get me out before i start pissing myself in public . drooling . it would look bad for the bureau , right ?	so you 're gon na coast to retirement , when you could nail these guys and go out with come dignity .
sorry .	yeah . that was thirty years ago anyway . l.a. 's changed a lot since then . the air got dirty and the sex got clean . so you want to nail the ex- presidents ? be a big hero ?
yeah . what 's your theory ?	the fucking punks are surfers .
oh well he must be a surfer .	shutup , you might learn somethin ' you 're not careful ... so last year nixon scuffs a counter going over . there was a soil sample . non- specific mud traces of asphalt , oils , blah , blah ... sand and ... carnuba wax . so i became a wax expert . there 's 80 some uses for this stuff , something like five hundred products .
candle wax . car wax . mustache wax ? could be anything . guy 's waxing his mustache at the beach . gets sand in it . wipes it off with a shoe . shoe scuffs the counter .	the lab made three possible matches , this was one of 'em .
sex wax ? you 're not into kinky shit , are you angelo ?	surfers use it on their boards . they rub sand into it for traction .
... four months . june to october . mmmm ... same the year before .	another month and we do n't see 'em again 'til next summer .
johnny , it 's the only way .	why ca n't i just walk around with this thing under my arm and act stoned ? ask a few questions .
they 're like some kind of tribe . got their own language . you ca n't just walk up to these guys . you 've got to get out there . learn some moves . get into their head . pick up the speech .	angelo , this stuff is for little rubber people who do n't shave yet .
i think you got ta hit them straight on !	got it ...
what , you could n't have just left the thing in your car ?	it sticks out , so i ca n't lock it . look , angelo , you think i joined the fbi to learn to surf ? this was your lame-o idea in the first place . you got ta back me up on this .
angelo , pay attention . there 's gon na be a test afterward . lab is showing traces of toxins . pcbs . heavy elements ... selenium , titanium and arsenic .	guy 's the toxic avenger .
the beaches are always being closed because of waste spills , right ? and surfers are territorial . they stick mostly to certain breaks . if we can get some hair samples , and get a match to a certain beach , we 'd know which break the ex-presidents surf . you buyin ' this ?	no . but let 's do it , anyway . it 's gon na bug the shit out of harp .
big zippo so far . how about you ?	patience hotshot . patience . it 'll be subtle , if it 's here at all .
no , but there are four guys back there you might check out .	thanks , buddy .
look , if you 're gon na go leavin ' your piece and your shield in the car , you can damn well stay in sight . okay ?	okay , dad .
... felony b and e , three months in juvey . better . felony assault . postgraduate work at chino . excellent . i 'm lovin ' it . what about the brother ? great ! another model citizen . these guys really fit the profile .	remember , all bank robbers are losers , but not all losers are bank robbers .
when did harp say they 'd have the warrant ?	he 's pushing it through first thing . you better get some sleep tonight , it could be an interesting morning .
did that worthless punk partner of mine ever show up ?	right here , partner .
i 'm ready to rock , angelo . where you want me ?	cole and munoz are going in the back door . babbit is backing me . so i want you at the side window by the hedge . you 're strictly backup , got it ?
got it .	awright . get into position . i 'm rolling .
aw shit .	nice tattoo , dietz .
johnny ! uh , you , uh ... should call first , you know ? hey , where the hell were you all day ? you got ta at least call in or something . you okay ?	angelo , we got ta talk .
... so i started tailing him .	this zen master surfer .
bodhi , yeah . i 'm on him all day , right . he goes here , he goes there , he goes to tower records and buys come cds , he has lunch at patrick 's road house ... ... he goes into the assured trust savings and loan .	did he rob it ?
cute . he was inside for about 20 minutes . the other guy , roach , waited in the truck . they were scoping it out , right ? !	yeah , or cashing a check .
wait , wait . then these guys go back to their beach house and box up all their shit . load it in bodhi 's truck and take it to a public storage unit . you see ? summer 's almost over . they 're splitting . they 're gon na pick up a little traveling money tomorrow . the next day at the outside latest . i got a feeling .	last time you got a feeling i had to kill a man , which i always hate because it looks bad on the report .
they 're on their way to maui .	no way . not yet . come on .
i say we call it in . get some backup . but you got ta do it . harp wo n't listen to me .	sure . no problem . i 'll just call up and tell him his favorite agent saw this one surfer moon another surfer yesterday and it looked real suspicious . shit , he 'll probably call out the national guard .
i say we do n't call it in . under no circumstance are we to call this in .	look , we handle it ourselves , for right now , okay ? we cover the bank , whatever . you and me . that way if nothing happens , or more accurately , when nothing happens ... i do n't get my tits any further into the wringer than they already are .
time for lunch .	angelo , it 's eleven thirty .
the hell are they ? !	they took a left at the next light !
nothing ?	nothing .
i know where they 're going .	figured you did .
angelo ! do n't fire !	kid , get outta the way ! !
what do you want ?	shrimp and fries .
i mean , what do you want ? what are you doing hanging around here .	i need you to teach me .
gim me a break . one shrimp and fries to go ! anything to drink ?	i 'm serious .
i can see that . but forget it . stick to tennis , or whatever you 're good at . miniature golf . here , your number 's 37 .	well , i 'm just gon na go back out there till i catch on to it or break my neck .
what is it ? you all of a sudden got this bug you had to go surfing ? this is a line , right ?	no , no . see , all my life i 've done things for other people . in high school i played football because my old man expected me to . then my parents always figured i 'd go to law school , so i did . football scholarship . graduated phi beta kappa --
this gon na take long ?	wait , so i 'm a big hero to my folks , right ? but two years ago they got killed in a car wreck and i just suddenly realized all my goals had been their goals . and i had n't been living my own life . so i wanted something for myself . something that maybe did n't make any sense . you know what i mean ?
i came out here from ohio a month ago . never saw the ocean before . i did n't think it would effect me so much . like i 'm drawn to it , or something . i want to do what you do . it 's the truth .	tomorrow , 6 am . here . if you 're a minute late i 'm gone . and stud ... i did n't take you to raise . i can show you a few things but after that you 're on your own . that 'll be four fifty .
stop here . do you agree to do exactly what i say when i say it ?	sure .
nice place .	he rents it for the summer . bodhi always gets some slick place and throws it open to every surf burnout around . most a these guys ca n't keep a job . when the swell comes , they 're gone , they have to ride .
who 's the girl ?	catch of the day .
oh , oh . that sounds personal .	people are expendable to bodhi .
meaning you were expendable .	we went out for about five minutes ... which is four minutes longer than most of them . but you ca n't hold it against him , he 's ... different .
sure , he 's `` the bodhisattva '' .	yeah , he thinks he 's evolved to a higher plane of existence , or something . maybe he has . you 've seen him surf ... that frenzy . it seems like anger . it 's not . it 's the energy of lovemaking . the sea is the woman in his life . she 's his only true lover .
bunch of goddamn adrenaline junkies . i hope you 're not buying into this banzai-bullshit like the rest of bodhi 's moonies .	what are you talking about ?
what 's goin ' on ?	swell 's here , johnny . bodhi always knows .
i can barely do this in broad daylight .	come on . at least no one 's gon na see how bad you are .
you had enough ?	yeah . i just want to sit out here for a minute .
look at you .	what ?
well , usually you have this sort of intense scowl of concentration , like you 're doing this for a school project or something ... i do n't know , like something 's driving you . see , it 's gone . if i did n't know better i 'd say you looked almost happy .	i ... i do n't know . i ca n't describe what i 'm feeling .
those are cold .	warm them up .
i ... i got ta go .	johnny ... what 's going on ? i do n't get it ... did i do something ?
ouch .	betadyne does n't hurt .
so what 'd the other guy look like ?	never saw him , was your basic hit and run .
jesus christ , johnny -- you 've been using me ! your jacket 's on the floor in the bathroom -- this goddamn thing 's half out of the pocket ... oh god , it 's all part of some case , is n't it ?	tyler , put the gun down .
i work bank robbery . guys i 'm after are surfers . i needed you , at first , but not --	fuck you , johnny utah . fuck you ! ! do n't you have a soul ? goddamn you to hell !
well , i saw you and --	yeah , you saw me and you figured that if a mere girl can do it , a big strong stud like you should n't have any problem . right ? ! well you figured wrong , dork !
hey ! uh , how do i get back in ?	carefully , tough guy . very carefully .
my name 's johnny utah !	who cares !
bye .	wait ! jesus christ ! you 're fucking crazy , you know that ? you go in there you 're gon na eat it on the rocks . here , follow me .
major , looks like there were ten , maybe twelve guerrillas . looks like they took some prisoners from the chopper . then a different set of track , over there .	what do you mean ?
strange , major . there was a firefight . shooting in all directions .	i ca n't believe jim hopper walked into an ambush .
i do n't believe he did , sir . i could n't find a single track . just does n't make sense .	what about the rest of hopper 's men ?
billy ... what the hell 's wrong with you ?	something ... in the trees ...
you 've been pushing too many pencils , dillon . had enough ?	no way , old buddy .
that piece of work you guys pulled off at the berlin embassy last week was really something . blew the entry points on three floors and neutralized the opposition in eight seconds flat . beautiful .	like the old days , dillon .
was n't my style . we 're a rescue unit , not assassins . this must be good . big shot from the cia , leaves his desk to come back to the bush . what 's so important ?	those cabinet members are very important to our scope of operations in this part of the world . they 're about to get squeezed . we ca n't let that happen . i needed someone who could get the job done , quick and quiet ... no screw-ups . i needed the best . the best . so , i pulled a few strings at the state department ... and here we are .
our rendezvous points and radio freqs . are indicated and fixed . awacs contact on four hour intervals .	who 's our back-up on this ?
no such thing , old buddy . it 's a one way ticket . once we cross that border , we 're on our own .	this gets better by the minute .
you do n't know how much i missed this , dutch ! ! ! once you get this in your blood , you never get it out ! ! !	you never were all that smart ... let 's go ! ! !
billy 's on it . heat seeker . pretty sophisticated for half-asses mountain boys .	they 're getting better equipped every day .
mean anything to you ?	probably another rebel patrol . they operate in here all the time .
i knew this man . green berets , out of fort bragg . what the hell were they doing in here ? you got any answers for this , dillon ?	jesus ... this is inhuman . uh ... i was n't told of any operations in this area . they should n't have been here .
it was all bullshit . all of it . from the start ... you set us up , got us in here to do your dirty work .	that 's right , i set you up . you 're a veteran at this , dutch , i had to .
why us ?	because i told you , you 're the best . i knew you could do it but i could n't get you in here without a cover story .
what story did you give to davis ?	we 've been lookin ' for this place for months . the chopper must have gotten close when they got shot down . hopper was sent in to get my men . he was just doing his job . when he disappeared i had to clean this up , i had to stop there bastards . we were so close , we could n't quit . we could n't sleep through this one . i needed you , dutch , ca n't you see that ?
she 's too valuable . she 's got to know their whole network . the whole set up . we take her with us .	we take her and she 'll give away our position , every chance she gets . no prisoners , dillon .
blain ... ... just like the others ... no powder burns , no shrapnel .	the wound all fused , cauterized ... what the hell did this ?
we 're still too far in , they wo n't risk coming in for us .	expendable assets , dillon . seems langley is never around when you need them .
i can accept that , it comes with the job .	bullshit . you 're just like the rest of us .
you 're wastin ' your time .	no more games .
what the hell do you think you 're doing ?	we 're going to need everyone .
what are you talking about ? we 'll be out of here in ten minutes .	we 're not going .
he 'll be looking for the trip wires . if we 're lucky , he wo n't see this .	now what , dutch . you going to send your mystery guest an invitation ?
no way , dutch . i 'm going . you get these people and get the hell out of here .	this is n't your style , dillon .
guess i 've picked up some bad habits from you , dutch . now do n't argue with me , you know i 'm right . get to that chopper and hold it for us . we 'll be along .	you know you ca n't win this one .
i 'll see you there .	right behind you .
thanks .	anytime .
do n't know , only saw one of 'em . camouflaged . he was there ... ... those fucking eyes ...	what , sergeant ?
take a position over there . i 'll work around towards you . when i flush him , you nail him ...	... right , i got a score to settle for the bro ...
any sign of the hostages ?	we found 'em both , dead . and the gear from the chopper . if they 're central american , i 'm a fuckin ' chinaman . by the looks of 'em , i 'd say our cabinet minister and his aide are cia . another thing , major , we were lucky ... couple of those guys we waxed are russians , military advisors by the look of it . something big was about to happen here .
what 's got billy so spooked ?	ca n't say , major ... been squirrely all mornin ' ... fuckin ' weird ... sometimes i think that nose of his is too good ... smells things that ai n't there .
you saw what ?	i saw it .
put him in his poncho and liner and carry him back . we 'll bury him in the morning .	i 'll take him .
we 've got most of the flares , frags . and two claymores just outside . nothin 's comin ' close to here without trippin ' on somethin ' .	thank you , sergeant .
i 'm sorry , bull . it 's never easy . he was a good soldier .	the best friend i ever had .
you 're looking well , dutch .	it 's been a long time , general .
that 's over the border , general .	that 's the problem . apparently they strayed off course . we 're certain they 've been captured by the guerrillas .
what have you got in mind , general .	we figure we 've got less than twenty-four hours to catch up with them . after that , there 's not much hope . we want a rescue operation mounted tonight . that does n't give you much time .
you lift off in three hours . there 's one other thing .	what 's that , general ?
took 'em out with a heat seeker .	there 's something else , major ...
mmmnnn ... ?	i do n't think that was any ordinary army taxi ...
what 's he got ?	same business , guerrillas hauling two guys from the chopper ... followed by men with american equipment ...
major , you 'd better take a look at this .	hawkins ?
what in god 's name ... ?	i think it 's hawkins .
where the hell is his body ?	there 's no sign of it .
how could anyone get through this , carry blain out , right under our noses without leavin ' a trace ?	he knows our defenses .
georgia .	no wonder . for starts , you should know that hot pants are < u > horrid < /u > , even when you do have the legs to carry them off . what are your plans while you 're in town ?
well ... i might be going out to dinner .	you 'll want a cocktail dress then . turn . you have a beautiful figure . a little too out in the open but simply lovely . size six ? do you need shoes ?
i dunno . do thigh high , leather boots go with a cocktail dress ?	philip ! we 'll need shoes !
your uncle will like this .	he 's not really my uncle .
mr. harris , we know you 've purchased at least twenty percent of our stock . we also know you plan to file a formal bid for a majority share .	twenty-five percent .
we 're on the verge of closing a large navy contract . double is ridiculous but we can assure you a healthy profit on your shares . we would give you a promissory note ...	you 're not getting any navy contracts .
there 's no way you could know that .	but i do know . i also know your lines of credit are over-extended . if i do n't buy your company , someone else will ... ah , the escargot .
we can reach an understanding on this .	i do n't think so . you should know we 're going to fight you with every resource we have .
do what you have to do . i do n't take it personally .	i do . i take it all very personally . very nice meeting you , vivian .
i like your hat .	huh ? oh ... yeah . s'okay ? uhm ... how 're ... business things going .
let 's not talk about it , it 's too depressing . come on , i 'll show you thunder .	please , we hardly know each other .
hey , big guy , you getting tired , yet ? i am . this is vivian . you two been together long ? you and edward ?	no .
it 's ... it 's not like that .	i see . well . maybe that means you 'd have lunch with me sometime then .
you do n't know anything about me .	i 'd like to find out . you do n't know anything about me either . that 's why people have lunch .
what 's that long building over there ?	storage , i think .
the real estate possibilities are endless . most of the yard we 'll just level . i talked to a couple of developers , under the table , of course , and they said --	you what ?
congratulations , sir .	what ?
who are you going after next , sir ?	who indeed ...
what would it take to buy our stock back ? name your price .	to get me in a mood to sell -- double what i paid . but your company does n't have enough capital right now to buy anything .
mr. kross , i 'm not here to sell you my stock . on the contrary , i 'm here to buy yours .	you 've got a lot of nerve .
no . what i have is a lot of money .	i know all about you , mr. harris . when you buy companies , they have a way of disappearing . even the pension funds are stripped clean . the last three companies you took over were cut up in so many pieces , widows were left without their retirement checks .
what i did with those companies was perfectly legal .	i do n't question the legality of what you do . it 's your morality that makes me sick . i will not allow my company to be raped by a man like you .
mr. harris .	how are you , mr. kross .
yes . i 'm here to tell you that i 've reconsidered my position on your acquisition offer .	< u > expected < /u > ... offer .
of course , yes . after the < u > expected < /u > filing period is over , i 'm going to recommend to the board that we accept your bid .	you 're making the right decision , sir .
stop . for just a moment . mr. kross , i 'd like to ask you a few questions < u > before < /u > you sign . you realize that you 're a target . if you were n't mine , you 'd be someone elses , correct ?	yes .
i ... i would take advantage of it .	how ?
i ... i do n't know . there ... there was n't time ...	i suppose you 'd find out soon enough that you have assets you presently do n't seem aware of , would n't you ? the waste processing licenses at that abandoned shipyard of yours , you 'd certainly find out about that .
quiet . would i get the loans ?	this time i imagine you would , yes . hmm ... with all this in mind , mr. kross , i ca n't logically make a formal bid on your company , can i ?
you 'd be initiating a financial battle you 'd ultimately lose , mr. harris .	you 're very right . i think the best thing we could all do is go home .
hey sugar , you lookin ' for a date ?	what 's that ?
you looking ' for some company ?	uh , no . how do i get to beverly hills ?
what ? you gon na tell me you 're lost ?	yes .
no , you look like a hooker .	actually , i 'm a movie star out for a walk .
good . can you tell me how to get to beverly hills ?	sure . for five bucks .
that 's ridiculous .	the price just went up to ten .
why do n't you just do it out of the kindness of your heart ?	sit ... and spin .
nice car . yours ?	no .
stolen ?	not exactly .
mind if i turn on some heat ?	if you can figure it out , be my guest .
very good . you 're obviously mechanical .	you 're not from l.a. , huh ?
new york .	what motel you staying at ?
< u > ho < /u > tel .	okay , what < u > ho < /u > tel ?
regent beverly wilshire . i bet you know it .	yeah , i peed in the fountain there once . give me a break .
what 's your name ?	what do you want it to be ? vivian , my name 's vivian .
you like being a hooker , vivian ?	it pays .
so do day jobs .	day jobs , yeah . i 've tried them . turn right .
must be dangerous . hooking .	tell me about it . l.a. is suffering from a wacko epidemic . and who knows where half the guys i pick up have been . i mean , i use condoms . always . and i get checked out once a month at the free clinic . not only am i better in the sack than an amateur , i 'm probably safer .
very good . you ought to have that printed up on your business card .	if you 're making fun of me , i do n't like it .
ugly habit , biting your nails .	you do n't know habits , you think this is ugly .
what do you charge for company , vivian ?	company would cost you ... a hundred dollars .
for the whole night ?	for an hour .
you 're joking .	i never joke about money .
no , but it 's getting there .	vivian , how much to put up with me for the entire night ?
three hundred .	fine .
what 's your name , lover .	edward . my name is edward .
get in . this side .	what ?
better believe it .	then let 's go . it 's worth 300 just so i do n't have to drive .
my raincoat 's in the back . put it on .	why ?
you may feel more comfortable . this is not the kind of place that rents rooms by the hour .	you mean they do n't have hookers .
every place has hookers , but if this hotel has hookers , they do n't look like they 're ...	off the boulevard .
room service . what do you drink ?	diet coke .
send up a bottle of crystal champagne .	can i have some chips ?
want to know something ? i do n't quite know . i had n't planned this .	do you plan everything ?
always .	well , the meter 's running , it 's your money . speaking of which , cash 'll do . in advance .
let 's talk some more first .	right . so ! in town on business ?
uh-huh .	let me guess , you 're a ... lawyer .
and why do you say that ?	i dunno ... you have that sharp , useless look .
sounds like you 've known a lot of lawyers .	i 've known a lot of everybody .
i think he wanted you to tip him .	tsk . excuse me , i did n't think he had change for a hundred .
where are they ? shopping together ?	they should be . they 're both good at it .
it 's a very good year .	oooh , thank god .
try a strawberry .	why ?
because they bring out the flavor of the champagne .	jesus , you act like you 're seducing some valley girl you picked up in a dance club .
you really are a very beautiful girl .	just a romantic , that 's you .
what do you like ?	if i want you to turn me on i 'll pay < u > you < /u > three hundred . just lay back and let me drive .
good morning .	you did n't wake me . i 'll be out of here in a minute .
did you sleep well ?	yeah . too good . i forgot where i was .
where 'd you go ?	i took the couch . i had some work to do . about last night ...
oooh , baby , you were the best . i was beside myself .	mmm , i could tell .
i just hope it was worth three hundred bucks .	i 'd say you give a good dollar value .
do you ever ... enjoy it ?	i like guys if that 's what you 're asking . not that i trust 'm .
no ? why 's that ?	`` occupational hazard '' .
i buy companies .	no shit . they expensive ?
the one i 'm buying this week will cost around 150 million .	... dollars ?
so what a ya do with the companies once you buy 'm ?	i sell them .
by breaking up a company 's assets --	what are assets ?
vivian --	c'mon , i might buy a company some day .
assets are anything of value a company owns . sometimes the pieces are worth more than the whole . by selling them off , i make a profit .	sorta like stealing cars and selling 'm for parts , huh ?
not ... quite .	there , see ? now the emblem is right in the middle of the knot .
where 'd you learn to do this ?	i fucked the debate team in high school . tsk . i had a grampa . he liked ties on sundays . you mind if i take a swim in your bathtub before i hit it ?
all right . how much for the week ?	what ?
it 'd cost you .	of course . how much ?
four thousand .	vivian , may i point out five more nights at three hundred a night is only 1,500 .
but you want days too .	all right , two thousand .
three .	done .
i 'm not just talking about sex .	look butthead , i 'll treat you so nice you 'll never want to let me go , okay ?
never answer the phone . ever .	tsk , believe me , this will be the last time .
did you buy some clothes ?	i got a dress , yeah .
just one ? christ ... i hope it 's appropriate .	it 's very tasteful . i think you 'll especially like the zipper in the crotch . i 'm -- joking .
let 's hope so . you 'll get some more clothes tomorrow . i 'll be pushed for time so meet me in the hotel lobby at seven forty-five sharp . got it ?	no , i do n't `` got it '' . even the farmboys back in georgia come to the door when they 're taking you on a date .
this is n't a date .	go by yourself then . where you taking me anyway ?
the rex .	any good ?
i think you 'll approve .	... all right . i 'll meet you in the lobby . but only cause you 're paying me to .
hello ?	i thought i told you not to answer the phone .
i 'm sorry .	you 're forgiven .
and that 's the way the game is played .	some game . screwin ' some poor slob out of his retirement .
you 're upset , huh ?	upset . no . i never get upset about business .
you liked the guy , though .	whether i liked him or not is irrelevant . it 's business . there 's no emotion involved in business ... if you want to survive .
know what we 're gon na do in a little while then ? we 're gon na call domino 's and have 'm deliver a bigass pizza . we 're gon na eat it in bed . we 're gon na veg ' out and watch television .	television ?
yeah , it 's this box , it has pictures , sound . you do n't have to use your brain at all .	i have work to do .
i still do n't understand why you only bought one dress .	i was n't as much fun as i thought it was going to be .
why not ?	well , you know those cold bitches that work in those stores and try to intimidate you ? it works .
was someone rude to you ?	i had a little problem in one store . i was n't dressed right . i do n't know what to say . i do n't belong there . maybe i 'll just go back to bridget . she was cool .
okay .	good .
i thought maybe you 'd like dinner .	thank you . i would . nice .
wait till you see what i have on underneath .	please .
what about dinner ?	dinner can wait .
you always been rich ?	no .
seems like it . i guess it 's easy to get used to , huh ?	easier than learning how to be poor . my father 's family was wealthy . when i was young there were cars and houses , private schools , nannies . but then my father divorced my mother to marry another woman . and he took his money with him .
keep talkin ' . i like hearin ' .	not much to tell . i went to public school . went to university on scholarship . went to work for an investment firm . in eight years i owned it . my father was chairman of the board of the third company i ever went after . i swallowed that company and shit out the pieces . one of the pieces was him .
you still mad at 'm ?	he died a long time ago .
you 're really pushing it , bringing me here .	i think it 's exciting .
what id we run into someone i know ?	i really doubt anyone here frequents hollywood boulevard .
real genuine guy .	he 's good at what he does .
you could freeze ice on his wife 's ass . she anything like your ex ?	shall we mingle ?
edward , these women here , i do n't think any of 'm like the guys they 're with . they 're just into it for the money .	i 'm sure that 's true for some of them .
i thought i was the pro . these women make me feel like an amateur .	ready to stomp sod ?
you asshole ! i ca n't believe what a -- !	vivian , what the --
clean the slut up , take her out , huh ? ! what are you trying to prove ! ? i 'm not a piece of meat for you to offer to your friends !	i do n't know what you 're talking about .
i 've been with stinking old men who 've made me want to puke but i 've never had anyone make me feel as dirty as you did tonight .	would you please calm down . tell me what happened .
what was i supposed to do ? i told the truth . why should the truth upset you ? it 's not as if you 're from a convent .	i want my fucking money . i 'm getting out of here . i do n't want anything more to do with you .
can we talk about this ? can you just try to calm down ?	your goddamned friend , he thinks the only reason i 'm with you is for the money .
well , it 's true . just pay me what you owe me and i 'm gone .	vivian ...
pay me ! before i pick up this chair and smash your face in .	fine . i 'm only here a couple of more days and i 'm not going to spend them fighting with you .
fuck off .	i 'll call you a cab . if you want the clothes , pack them up .
vivian ... i 'm sorry . i was n't prepared for questions about us . it was an idiotic and insensitive thing i did . i should have known that it would hurt you .	i 'm not hurt . it does n't hurt you when somebody pisses on you , it just pissed you off .
do i look okay ?	hmm ... let 's see ... no , there 's something missing .
what 's that ?	i do n't want you to get too excited ... these are on loan ... however ...
edward , i ca n't .	shush . of course you can .
what if i lose it ?	you wo n't .
what if someone tries to steal it ?	i 'll guard them and you with my life .
you do n't want to go all the way to san francisco in a limousine , do you ? i do n't .	where are you taking me ! ?
to meet some friends . rudolpho , a poet ... benoit , a landlord ... mimi , a flower maker ...	huh ?
i 've never been on a plane before .	i 'm glad you like it . now be quiet , i 've really got to read these .
sorry . you 're not paying me to ask you question like that .	vivian . i 'm paying you to be you . be you . have you ? ever been in love with anyone ?
you mean , besides elvis ? i 'm a human being . sure . once . first time i ever ran away from home , i got as far as atlanta . i met this boy . he 'd been with his parents on their way to chicago . they stopped at a gas station . he went to the john . when he came back they 'd split . we sorta started looking out for each other . aw , he was sweet . and boy , was he good looking , y'know , dark hair and eyes . the chicken hawks were on him all the time . he hated that . sometimes we 'd find a safe place to crash nights and we 'd curl up together and we 'd talk about all these crazy things . the two of us getting married someday . having kids . stupid stuff .	what happened to him ?
if it 's in italian , how will i know what they 're saying ?	i 'll whisper some of the main parts of the story to you . but you 'll be surprised how much you understand . the music conveys the story more powerfully than any words .
but do n't they have it in english ?	vivian , do n't be afraid of what you do n't know . that 's the fun of it .
if you 'd gone on about how much you liked it , i 'm not sure i 'd have believed you .	i more than liked it .
i know . i 'm glad .	did you ?
one more night and you 're finally rid of me .	yeah , you 've been pretty tough to take .
what else ? you gon na leave some cash by the bed when you pass through town ?	it would n't be like that . i want to get you off the street . you 'll have a different kind of life . what 's wrong with that ?
vivian , i 've thought about this a lot . this is the best solution .	when i was a little girl , my mother locked me in the attic when i was bad , which was pretty often . i 'd stare out the window up there and make believe i was a princess trapped in the tower by the wicked queen . then suddenly a knight on a white horse with his bright colors flying would ride up . rescue me from the tower , and then we 'd ride off ... but never , ever in all the times i had that dream did the knight say , `` come on baby , i 'll put you up in a great condo . ''
vivian , life 's not a fairy tale .	i know . hey , do n't mind me . i 'm being stupid . i 'll think about it , okay ? it 's a real good offer for a whore .
i 've never treated you like a whore .	you just did .
what did you do to him ?	what do you mean ?
last time i saw him he was this strong guy . now he 's beaten . and you < u > liked him < /u > .	vivian , i want you to listen to me . the man realized that it would be better for his future and his son 's future , if he cooperated .
right .	it 's not your concern . it 's ... business , that 's all .
business .	yes . the man made a business decision .
it 's all just business to you . him . me . your life . everything 's business .	it 's what i do for a living . it 's how i make money .
why do guys always know how to hit a woman ? right across the cheek , wham , so it feels like your eye is gon na explode . what do they do , take you all aside in high school and show you how ? it pisses me off !	not all men hit . and no one is going to hit you anymore .
right . you 're quite the sir galahad today , are n't ya ' ? i heard what you did with kross .	it was a business decision .
i got tired of hating my father .	it was good .
you 're packing .	i 'm leaving . do n't ya see ? if i stay with you like you want me to , there 'll always be some guy , your friends eve , treatin ' me like that ... thinkin ' they 're allowed to . what are you gon na do , fight 'm all ? no . i 'll take my money now , please .
aw , do n't ... no ...	stay with me tonight . not because you 're being paid to . stay with me because you want to .
i did n't think so .	vivian ...
barnard thomas , manager of the hotel .	of course , yes . if you 'll excuse me just a moment --
i have a message for you from your `` niece '' , sir .	my what ?
mr. harris , a guest of yours , is a guest of ours and shall be treated accordingly . the young lady asked me to tell you that she is waiting for you in the lounge .	thank you .
good afternoon , mr. harris .	afternoon .
what 's up , where you going ?	give me your car keys , will you , i 'm going back to my hotel .
at least stay for a drink . this party 's for you .	apologize to elizabeth for me .
listen , there 're some major local talent inside just dying to meet you ...	really ? some high class gold digger who speaks french better than i do ? no , thank you . i just got off the phone with one .
cynthia 's not coming ?	no .
love this car ! is it new ?	yes ! and you do n't even know where you 're going !
i want to .	edward , if the three of us sit down together we might as well announce our plans in the wall street journal .
i 'll see him alone . everyone knows you 're my muscle . we 'll make it social . tell kross i 'll meet him for dinner . tonight if you can arrange it .	you should n't go alone . he might claim that you tried to black mail him .
bill , we 're businessmen , not the damn mafia . i 'll see you in the office . by the way , about your car ...	oh , god , what ?
edward , did you hear me ?	i 'm here .
what ! ?	we do n't have the time to bring someone new up to speed . besides ... you 've already impressed everyone you need to , have n't you ?
what time 's diner tonight ?	eight o'clock . kross is bringing his son . very bright kid , watch yourself with him . who 's this girl you 're taking ?
goddamit ! where is he getting the money to fight ?	someone 's loaning it to him . get on it right away .
put the pension funds on hold until i say otherwise .	we 're letting them slide ?
i want the treatment plant licenses to be top priority right now .	but , edward ...
excuse me for saying this but what is wrong with you this week ? first , you go soft on the pension funds . now , you 're giving him the chance to get away ? as of two minutes ago , you are committed to the tune of over fifty million dollars --	come on , bill , do n't talk to me about how much money 's involved . it 's my money .
bill , i 'd like you to meet vivian .	bill stuckey , vivian . my wife , elizabeth .
fill me in on this . how 'd you and vivian meet ?	we just did .
come on , you can tell me . i sure would like to know where a guy runs into a girl as attractive as this .	the night i left your house , i was lost . i was looking for directions .
and you just happened to run into her . great . what 's she do ? she work ?	yes ...
doing what ?	vivian 's in sales .
why do you want to know ?	hear me out . i 've known you a long time . i see a difference in you this week . like that tie . i 'm suddenly wondering if this girl 's not the difference . especially when i see her talking with david kross .
she met him at dinner last night ... i like this tie .	so now they 're best friends ? edward , this girl appears out of nowhere and now i see her talking to a guy whose company we 're trying to buy . it 's too convenient .
you 're being ridiculous .	industrial espionage is not ridiculous . edward , how do you know she has n't attached herself to you so she can bring kross back information ?
this is no time to disappear . we 're in too far .	bill ? stop panicking . kross is n't going anywhere and i do n't need to spend the rest of the day watching his stock go down . i 'll be in the office tomorrow .
promise me you 'll read those contracts by then .	goodbye , bill .
did i wake you ?	i 'm up .
i had to call . i jus got off the phone with james kross . get this . he wants to see you . today .	why ?
he would n't say . edward ... i think we got him . his nuts are on the block and < u > we got him < /u > . you there ?	give me twenty minutes .
i do n't think there 's any sense in --	let him answer .
oh , my god ... edward , no !	i suppose you 'd use them as collateral on new loans , would n't you ?
what ! ?	have a good day , gentlemen .
you broke my nose .	i think i broke my hand . you 're fired .
edward , we 've been together ten years .	and i do n't like what we 've become . i 'll cover any losses you have on this one . now get out , you asshole !

carlos had some great rock .	i bet . that was our rent !
we worked for that money . we were gon na put together enough to get out of that dump we live in , get off this street .	viv ... do n't be stupid . we 're whores .
i just saw somebody pulled out of a dumpster . i wonder how much she made tonight ?	do n't be mad at me . i 'll pay you back . i promise .
i thought you were giving up that drug shit .	i will . i 'm trying . meanwhile i got some crack left , you wan na get high ?
no , let 's go to work . okay ?	okay . i 'm sorry i said your dream was stupid .

miss vivian --	maybe i 'll just order a burger , barney , that way i can eat with my hands .
miss vivian ... there 's a salon here in the hotel . instead of worrying unnecessarily about table manners , why do n't you just have your hair done instead ?	professionally ?
barnard thomas here . miss vivian , i wonder if you might come down to the front desk . there 's someone here to see you .	me ?

come on , barney , you and me live in the real world . you do n't know how to treat a girl like anything but a lady , mr. thomas .	certain ladies make that very easy ... vivian . john , call a limousine for our guest , please . have it take her anywhere she wishes to go . bill the hotel . see you again sometime soon .
may i help you ?	i 'm just looking , thanks .
are you looking for something in particular ?	yes . something ... conservative .
you have beautiful things . how much is this ?	i do n't think it would fit you .
i did n't ask if it would fit . i asked how much it was .	it 's very expensive .
what is with you ?	excuse me ?
i 'm going to spend < u > money < /u > .	i do n't think we have anything for you here . you 're obviously in the wrong place .
would you like to try it on ?	'scume me .
yes ?	do you remember me ?
no , i 'm sorry , i do n't .	i was in here yesterday .
having a good time , vivian ?	yeah . thanks .
what ?	it 's okay . edward told me . your secret 's safe with me .
yeah . sure . why not . call me at the regent beverly wilshire .	i just might do that .
do you want to know what he did ? do you want to know what the crazy son of a bitch did ? he handed the whole thing back to kross ! on a silver platter . for no reason ! what was he thinking , i mean , what was going through his goddam head ? why ? what was all that benevolent crap ? what are we going to become , a philanthropic foundation ? i 'll probably be the director of several worthwhile charities .	i think it 's great .
i bet . a lousy whore and you 're the gum in a hundred million dollar deal .	aw , come on , bill . it 's just business .
get out !	do n't worry . i 'll pay for it . what a you charge ? huh ? twenty , thirty , fifty bucks , < u > maybe < /u > ? are you a fifty dollar whore ?
do n't even think -- -- do n't even think about trying to escape . the chains are far too thick . and do n't dream of being rescued either . the only way in is secret . and only the prince , the count , and i know how to get in and out .	then i 'm here till i die ?
till they kill you . yeah .	then why bother curing me ?
the prince and the count always insist on everyone being healthy before they 're broken .	so it 's to be torture .
you do n't believe me ?	you survived the fire swamp . you must be very brave ... ... but nobody withstands the machine . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - 69 .
if we surrender , and i return with you , will you promise not to hurt this man ?	may i live a thousand years and never hunt again .
he is a sailor on the pirate ship `` revenge . '' promise to return him to his ship .	i swear it will be done .
my westley will always come for me .	i suggest a deal . you write four copies of a letter . i 'll send my four fastest ships . one in each direction . the dread pirate roberts is always close to florin this time of year . we 'll run up the white flag and deliver your message . if westley wants you , bless you both . if not ... please consider me as an alternative to suicide . are we agreed ?
he will come for me .	of course .
ah ! my dulcet darling . tonight we marry . tomorrow morning , your men will escort us to florin channel where every ship in my armada waits to accompany us on our honeymoon .	every ship but your four fastest , you mean .
every ship but the four you sent .	yes . yes , of course . naturally , not those four .
you never sent the ships . do n't bother lying . it does n't matter . westley will come for me anyway .	you 're a silly girl .
yes , i am a silly girl , for not having seen sooner that you were nothing but a coward with a heart full of fear .	i-would-not-say-such things-if- iwere-you-
you do n't seem excited , my little muffin .	should i be ?
brides often are , i 'm told .	i do not marry tonight .
i killed him myself .	then why is there fear behind your eyes ?
who are you ?	i am no one to be trifled with , that is all you ever need know .
to think -- all that time it was your cup that was poisoned .	they were both poisoned . i spent the last few years building up an immunity to iocane powder .
catch your breath .	if you 'll release me ... whatever you ask for ransom ... you 'll get it , i promise you ...
and what is that worth , the promise of a woman ? you 're very funny , highness .	i was giving you a chance . no matter where you take me ... there 's no greater hunter than prince humperdinck . he could track a falcon on a cloudy day . he can find you
i never said he was my dearest love . and yes , he will save me . that i know .	you admit to me you do not love your fiance ?
he knows i do not love him .	`` are not capable of love '' is what you mean .
rest , highness .	i know who you are -- your cruelty reveals everything .
you 're the dread pirate roberts ; admit it .	with pride . what can i do for you ?
you can die slowly cut into a thousand pieces .	hardly complimentary , your highness . why loose your venom on me ?
on the high seas , your ship attacked , and the dread pirate roberts never takes prisoners .	i ca n't afford to make exceptions . once word leaks out that a pirate has gone soft , people begin to disobey you , and then it 's nothing but work , work , work , all the time .
you mock my pain !	life is pain , highness . anyone who says differently is selling something . i remember this farm boy of yours , i think . this would be , what , five years ago ?
does it bother you to hear ?	nothing you can say will upset me .
i asked him what was so important for him . `` true love , '' he replied . and then he spoke of a girl of surpassing beauty and faithfulness . i can only assume he meant you . you should bless me for destroying him before he found out what you really are .	and what am i ?
faithfulness he talked of , madam . your enduring faithfulness . now , tell me truly . when you found out he was gone , did you get engaged to your prince that same hour , or did you wait a whole week out of respect for the dead ?	you mocked me once , never do it again -- i died that day !
... as ... you ... wish ...	oh , my sweet westley ; what have i done ?
farm boy . polish my horse 's saddle . i want to see my face shining in it by morning .	as you wish .
farm boy . fill these with water -- -- please .	as you wish .
i fear i 'll never see you again .	of course you will .
but what if something happens to you ?	hear this now : i will come for you .
but how can you be sure ?	this is true love . you think this happens every day ?
can you move at all ?	move ? you 're alive . if you want , i can fly .
i told you , `` i would always come for you . '' why did n't you wait for me ?	well ... you were dead .
death can not stop true love . all it can do is delay it for a while .	i will never doubt again .
we 'll never survive .	nonsense -- you 're only saying that because no one ever has . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - 57 .
singed a bit , were you ?	you ? -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - 58 .
this will all soon be but a happy memory because roberts ' ship `` revenge '' is anchored at the far end . and i , as you know , am roberts .	but how is that possible , since he 's been marauding twenty years and you only left me five years ago ?
finally , roberts decided something . he said , `` all right , westley , i 've never had a valet . you can try it for tonight . i 'll most likely kill you in the morning . '' three years he said that . `` good night , westley . good work . sleep well . i 'll most likely kill you in the morning . '' it was a fine time for me . i was learning to fence , to fight , anything anyone would teach me . and roberts and i eventually became friends . and then it happened .	what ? -- go on --
we 'll never succeed -- we may as well die here .	no . no . we have already succeeded .
i mean , what are the three terrors of the fire swamp ? one , the flame spurts . no problem . there 's a popping sound preceding each , we can avoid that . two , the lightning sand . but you were clever enough to discover what that looks like , so in the future we can avoid that too .	westley , what about the r.o.u.s . 's ?
we did it .	now , was that so terrible ? -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - 64 .
oh , westley , darling . westley , why wo n't you hold me ?	gently .
at a time like this that 's all you can think to say ? `` gently ? ''	gently ! !
oh , westley , will you ever forgive me ?	what hideous sin have you committed lately ?
i got married . i did n't want to . it all happened so fast .	it never happened .
what ?	it never happened . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - 117 .
but it did . i was there . this old man said , `` man and wife . ''	did you say , `` i do '' ?
well , no , we sort of skipped that part .	then you 're not married -- if you did n't say it , you did n't do it -- would n't you agree , your highness ?
i did that on purpose . i do n't have to miss .	i believe you -- so what happens now ?
we face each other as god intended . sportsmanlike . no tricks , no weapons , skill against skill alone .	you mean , you 'll put down your rock and i 'll put down my sword , and we 'll try to kill each other like civilized people ?
frankly , i think the odds are slightly in your favor at hand fighting .	it 's not my fault being the biggest and the strongest . i do n't even exercise . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - 38 .
look are you just fiddling around with me or what ?	i just want you to feel you 're doing well . i hate for people to die embarrassed .
you 're quick .	and a good thing too .
why is that , do you think ?	well , i have n't fought just one person for so long . i 've been specializing in groups . battling gangs for local charities , that kind of thing .
why should that make such a difference ?	well ... ... you see , you use different moves when you 're fighting half a dozen people than when you only have to be worried about one .
it 's fabric from the uniform of an army officer of guilder .	who 's guilder ?
once the horse reaches the castle , the fabric will make the prince suspect the guilderians have abducted his love . when he finds her body dead on the guilder frontier , his suspicions will be totally confirmed .	you never said anything about killing anyone .
i 've hired you to help me start a war . that 's a prestigious line of work with a long and glorious tradition .	i just do n't think it 's right , killing an innocent girl .
no more rhymes now , i mean it .	anybody want a peanut ?
i only dog paddle .	veer left . left . left !
faster !	i thought i was going faster .
you were supposed to be this colossus . you were this great , legendary thing . and yet he gains .	well , i 'm carrying three people . and he 's got only himself .
-- i do not accept excuses . i 'm just going to have to find myself a new giant , that 's all .	do n't say that , vizzini . please .
you be careful . -- people in masks can not be trusted .	i 'm waiting !
give her to me . catch up with us quickly .	what do i do ?
finish him , finish him . your way .	oh , good , my way . thank you , vizzini . which way is my way ?
probably he means no harm .	he 's really very short on charm .
oh , you 've a great gift for rhyme .	yes , some of the time .
fezzik , are there rocks ahead ?	if there are , we 'll all be dead .
hello .	it 's you .
you do n't look so good . you do n't smell so good either .	perhaps not . i feel fine .
he 's with the prince in the castle . but the castle gate is guarded by thirty men .	how many could you handle ?
i do n't think more than ten .	that leaves twenty for me . at my best , i could never defeat that many . i need vizzini to plan . i have no gift for strategy . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - 82 .
no -- not vizzini -- i need the man in black --	-- what ? --
-- look , he bested you with strength , your greatness . he bested me with steel . he must have outthought vizzini , and a man who can do that can plan my castle 's onslaught any day . let 's go --	-- where ?
to find the man in black , obviously .	but you do n't know where he is .
the man in black ?	his true love is marrying another tonight , so who else has cause for ultimate suffering ? excuse me --
-- fezzik , please --	everybody ... move ! !
well , we montoyas have never taken defeat easily . come along , fezzik . bring the body .	the body ?
have you any money ?	i have a little .
inigo -- there 's more than thirty --	what 's the difference ? we 've got him . help me here . we 'll have to force feed him .
has it been fifteen minutes ?	we ca n't wait -- the wedding 's in half an hour and we must strike in the hustle and the bustle beforehand .
tilt his head back . open his mouth .	how long do we have to wait before we know if the miracle works ?
you 've been mostly dead all day .	we had miracle max make a pill to bring you back .
where did we put that wheelbarrow the albino had ?	over the albino , i think .
will this do ?	where did you get that ?
do n't pester him , he 's had a hard day .	right , right , sorry .
inigo .	what ?
he 's getting away from me , fezzik . please . fezzik !	i 'll be right back .
i brought you a special present .	what is it ?
a book ?	that 's right . when i was your age , television was called books . and this is a special book . it was the book my father used to read to me when i was sick , and i used to read it to your father . and today , i 'm gon na read it to you .
it does n't sound too bad . i 'll try and stay awake .	oh . well , thank you very much . it 's very nice of you . your vote of confidence is overwhelming . all right . the princess bride , by s. morgenstern . chapter one . buttercup was raised on a small farm in the country of florin .
her favorite pastimes were riding her horse and tormenting the farm boy that worked there . his name was westley , but she never called him that . is n't that a wonderful beginning ?	yeah . it 's really good .
-hold it , hold it-	what is this ? are you trying to trick me ? -- where 's the sports ? -- is this a kissing book ?
-- wait , just wait --	-- well , when does it get good ?
it was a very emotional time for buttercup --	i do n't be-leeve this .
westley did n't reach his destination . his ship was attacked by the dread pirate roberts , who never left captives alive . when buttercup got the news that westley was murdered --	-- murdered by pirates is good --
what ?	the eel does n't get her . i 'm explaining to you because you looked nervous .
well , maybe i was a little bit concerned . but that 's not the same thing .	because i can stop now if you want .
oh no . no , please .	what is it ? what 's the matter ? -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - 56 .
they 're kissing again , do we have to hear the kissing part ?	someday , you may not mind so much .
skip on to the fire swamp -- that sounded good .	oh . you 're sick , i 'll humor you . so now , where were we here ? yeah , yeah , yeah . ah . oh . okay . westley and buttercup raced along the ravine floor .
you read that wrong . she does n't marry humperdinck , she marries westley . i 'm just sure of it . after all that westley did for her , if she does not marry him , it would n't be fair .	well , who says life is fair ? where is that written ? life is n't always fair .
i 'm telling you you 're messing up the story , now get it right !	do you want me to go on with this ?
yes .	all right , then . no more interruptions . ... at noon , she met her subjects again . this time as their queen .
it was ten days till the wedding . the king still lived , but buttercup 's nightmares were growing steadily worse .	see ? did n't i tell you she 'd never marry that rotten humperdinck ?
westley 's only faking , right ?	you want me to read this or not ?
who gets humperdinck ?	i do n't understand .
who kills prince humperdinck ? at the end , somebody 's got to do it . is it inigo ? who ?	nobody . nobody kills him . he lives . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - 90 .
no ! i 'm okay . i 'm okay . -- sit down . all right ?	okay . all right , now , let 's see . where were we ? oh yes . in the pit of despair .
what ? what ?	no , it 's kissing again . you do n't want to hear it .
now i think you ought to go to sleep .	okay .
maybe you could come over and read it again to me tomorrow .	as you wish ...
yellin .	sire .
as chief enforcer of all florin , i trust you with this secret : killers from guilder are infiltrating the thieves ' forest and plan to murder my bride on our wedding night .	my spy network has heard no such news .
she will not be murdered . on the day of the wedding , i want the thieves ' forest emptied and every inhabitant arrested .	many of the thieves will resist . my regular enforcers will be inadequate .
form a brute squad then . i want the thieves ' forest emptied before i wed .	it wo n't be easy , sire .
rise and report .	the thieves ' forest is emptied . thirty men guard the castle gate .
double it . my princess must be safe .	the gate has but one key , and i carry that .
you mean you wish to surrender to me ? very well , i accept .	i give you full marks for bravery -- do n't make yourself a fool .
ah , but how will you capture us ? we know the secrets of the fire swamp . we can live there quite happily for some time . so , whenever you feel like dying , feel free to visit .	i tell you once again -- surrender !
for the last time -- surrender !	death first ! !
a technicality that will shortly be remedied . but first things first . to the death .	no . to the pain .
i do n't think i 'm quite familiar with that phrase .	i 'll explain . and i 'll use small words so that you 'll be sure to understand , you wart-hog-faced buffoon .
-- and then my tongue , i suppose . i killed you too quickly the last time , a mistake i do n't mean to duplicate tonight .	i was n't finished -- the next thing you lose will be your left eye , followed by your right --
-- and then my ears , i understand . let 's get on with it	wrong ! your ears you keep , and i 'll tell you why --
there was a mighty duel -- it ranged all over . they were both masters .	who won ? how did it end ?
the loser ran off alone . the winner followed those footprints toward guilder !	shall we track them both ?
could this be a trap ?	i always think everything could be a trap -- which is why i 'm still alive .
once we 're out of sight , take him back to florin and throw him in the pit of despair .	i swear it will be done .
she 's been like that ever since the fire swamp . it 's my father 's failing health that 's upsetting her .	of course .
i could never cause you grief ; consider our wedding off . you returned this westley to his ship ?	yes .
your princess is really a winning creature . a trifle simple , perhaps , but her appeal is undeniable .	oh , i know . the people are quite taken with her . it 's odd , but when i hired vizzini to have her murdered on our engagement day , i thought that was clever . but it 's going to be so much more moving when i strangle her on our wedding night . once guilder is blamed , the nation will be truly outraged . they 'll demand we go to war .
now , where is that secret knot ? it 's impossible to find . are you coming down into the pit ? westley 's got his strength back . i am starting him on the machine tonight .	tyrone , you know how much i love watching you work . but , i 've got my country 's five hundredth anniversary to plan , my wedding to arrange , my wife to murder , and guilder to frame for it . i 'm swamped . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - 75 .
your guess is as good as mine --	i 'll beat you both apart . i 'll take you both together .
who are you ? -- are we enemies ? why am i on this wall ? -- where 's buttercup ? --	let me explain -- -- no , there is too much . let me sum up . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - 99 .
buttercup is marrying humperdinck in a little less than half an hour , so all we have to do is get in , break up the wedding , steal the princess , make our escape after i kill count rugen .	that does n't leave much time for dilly dallying .
and it is guarded by sixty men .	and our assets ?
well , why did n't you list that among our assets in the first place ? what i would n't give for a holocaust cloak .	there we can not help you .
why ? you ca n't even lift one .	true , but that 's hardly common knowledge , is it ? thank you . now , there may be problems once we 're inside .
now ?	not yet .
now ?	light him .
where 's fezzik ?	i thought he was with you .
no .	in that case --
you know , it 's very strange -- i have been in the revenge business so long , now that it 's over , i do n't know what to do with the rest of my life .	have you ever considered piracy ? you 'd make a wonderful dread pirate roberts .
hello . my name is inigo montoya . you killed my father . prepare to die .	stop saying that !
no --	-- offer me money --
-- yes --	-- power too -- promise me that --
-- all that i have and more please --	-- offer me everything i ask for --
-- anything you want --	i want my father back , you son- ofa-bitch !
what ? what ?	are you the miracle max who worked for the king all those years ?
look , i 'm retired . and besides , why would you want someone the king 's stinking son fired ? i might kill whoever you wanted me to miracle .	he 's already dead .
sir . sir .	hah ?
we 're really in a terrible rush .	do n't rush me , sonny . you rush a miracle man , you get rotten miracles . you got money ?
sixty-five .	sheesh ! i never worked for so little , except once , and that was a very noble cause . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - 93 .
this is noble , sir . his wife is crippled . his children are on the brink of starvation .	are you a rotten liar .
i need him to help avenge my father , murdered these twenty years .	your first story was better . where 's that bellows ? he probably owes you money , huh ? well , i 'll ask him .
he 's dead . he ca n't talk .	look who knows so much . well , it just so happens that your friend here is only mostly dead . there 's a big difference between mostly dead and all dead . please open his mouth .
now , mostly dead is slightly alive . now , all dead ... well , with all dead , there 's usually only one thing that you can do .	what 's that ?
true love . you heard him . you could not ask for a more noble cause than that .	sonny , true love is the greatest thing in the world . except for a nice mlt , a mutton , lettuce and tomato sandwich , where the mutton is nice and lean and the tomato is ripe . they 're so perky , i love that . but that 's not what he said . he distinctly said `` to blave . '' and , as we all know , `` to blave '' means `` to bluff . '' so you 're probably playing cards , and he cheated
humiliations galore !	that is a noble cause . give me the sixty-five , i 'm on the job .
thank you for everything .	okay . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - 97 .
slow going ?	look , i do n't mean to be rude , but this is not as easy as it looks . so i 'd appreciate it if you would n't distract me .
sorry .	thank you .
i do not suppose you could speed things up ?	if you 're in such a hurry , you could lower a rope , or a tree branch , or find something useful to do . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - 26 .
i could do that . in fact , i 've got some rope up here . but i do not think that you will accept my help , since i am only waiting around to kill you .	that does put a damper on our relationship .
but i promise i will not kill you until you reach the top .	that 's very comforting . but i 'm afraid you 'll just have to wait .
i hate waiting . i could give you my word as a spaniard .	no good . i 've known too many spaniards .
you do n't know any way you 'll trust me ?	nothing comes to mind .
we 'll wait until you 're ready .	again . thank you .
do you always begin conversations this way ?	my father was slaughtered by a sixfingered man . he was a great swordmaker , my father . and when the six-fingered man appeared and requested a special sword , my father took the job . he slaved a year before he was done .
how old were you ?	i was eleven years old . when i was strong enough , i dedicated my life to the study of fencing . so the next time we meet , i will not fail . i will go up to the sixfingered man and say , `` hello , my name is inigo montoya . you killed my father . prepare to die . ''
you 've done nothing but study swordplay ?	more pursuit than study lately . you see , i can not find him . it 's been twenty years now . i am starting to lose confidence . i just work for vizzini to pay the bills . there 's not a lot of money in revenge .
well , i certainly hope you find him , someday .	you are ready , then ?
you seem a decent fellow . i hate to kill you .	you seem a decent fellow . i hate to die .
i thought it fitting , considering the rocky terrain --	naturally , you must expect me to attack with capo ferro .
you are wonderful !	thank you -- i 've worked hard to become so .
i admit it -- you are better than i am .	then why are you smiling ?
because i know something you do n't know .	and what is that ?
you 're amazing !	i ought to be after twenty years .
there 's something i ought to tell you .	tell me .
who are you ? !	no one of consequence .
i must know .	get used to disappointment .
kill me quickly .	i would as soon destroy a stained glass window as an artist like yourself . however , since i ca n't have you following me either --
making sure nobody 's following us .	that would be inconceivable .
stop doing that . we can all relax , it 's almost over-	you 're sure nobody 's following us ?
as i told you , it would be absolutely , totally , and in all other ways , inconceivable . no one in guilder knows what we 've done . and no one in florin could have gotten here so fast . out of curiosity , why do you ask ?	no reason . it 's only , i just happened to look behind us , and something is there .
go in , get after her !	i do n't swim . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - 15 .
look ! he 's right on top of us . i wonder if he is using the same wind we are using .	whoever he is , he 's too late -- -- see ? the cliffs of insanity . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - 19 .
he 's climbing the rope . and he 's gaining on us .	inconceivable !
he did n't fall ? inconceivable ! !	you keep using that word -- i do not think it means what you think it means . my god ! he 's climbing .
i want to duel him left-handed .	you know what a hurry we 're in .
well , it 's the only way i can be satisfied . if i use my right -- tch -- over too quickly .	oh , have it your way .
let me explain-	-- there 's nothing to explain . you 're trying to kidnap what i 've rightfully stolen . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - 43 .
perhaps an arrangement can be reached .	there will be no arrangement -- -- and you 're killing her !
but if there can be no arrangement , then we are at an impasse .	i 'm afraid so -- i ca n't compete with you physically . and you 're no match for my brains .
you 're that smart ?	let me put it this way : have you ever heard of plato , aristotle , socrates ?
yes .	morons .
really ? in that case , i challenge you to a battle of wits .	for the princess ?
i accept .	good . then pour the wine .
inhale this , but do not touch .	i smell nothing .
what you do not smell is called iocane powder . it is odorless , tasteless , dissolves instantly in liquid , and is among the more deadlier poisons known to man .	hmm .
now , a clever man would put the poison into his own goblet , because he would know that only a great fool would reach for what he was given . i 'm not a great fool , so i can clearly not choose the wine in front of you . but you must have known i was not a great fool ; you would have counted on it , so i can clearly not choose the wine in front of me .	you 've made your decision then7
not remotely . because iocane comes from australia , as everyone knows . and australia is entirely peopled with criminals . and criminals are used to having people not trust them , as you are not trusted by me . so i can clearly not choose the wine in front of you .	truly , you have a dizzying intellect .
wait till i get going ! where was i ?	australia .
you 're just stalling now .	you 'd like to think that , would n't you ? you 've beaten my giant , which means you 're exceptionally strong . so , you could have put the poison in your own goblet , trusting on your strength to save you . so i can clearly not choose the wine in front of you . but , you 've also bested my spaniard which means you must have studied . and in studying , you must have learned that man is mortal so you would have put the poison as far from yourself as possible , so i can clearly not choose the wine in front of me .
you 're trying to trick me into giving away something -- it wo n't work --	it has worked -- you 've given everything away -- i know where the poison is .
then make your choice .	i will . and i choose --
what 's so funny ?	i 'll tell you in a minute . first , let 's drink -- me from my glass , and you from yours .
you guessed wrong .	you only think i guessed wrong -- -- that 's what 's so funny ! i switched glasses when your back was turned . you fool .
-- get back , witch --	i 'm not a witch , i 'm your wife . but after what you just said , i 'm not even sure i want to be that anymore .
`` true love . '' he said , `` true love , '' max . my god --	do n't say another word , valerie .
he 's afraid . ever since prince humperdinck fired him , his confidence is shattered .	why 'd you say that name -- you promised me that you would never say that name --
what , humperdinck ? humperdinck . humperdinck . ooo-ooo , humperdinck	i 'm not listening .
a life expiring and you do n't have the decency to say why you wo n't help --	nobody 's hearing nothing !
the chocolate coating makes it go down easier . but you have to wait fifteen minutes for full potency . and you should n't go swimming after , for at least , what ?	an hour .
yeah , an hour .	a good hour . yeah .
bye-bye , boys .	have fun storming the castle .
think it 'll work ?	it would take a miracle . bye !
you feeling any better ?	a little bit .
guess what .	what ?
your grandfather 's here .	mom , ca n't you tell him that i 'm sick ?
you are sick , that 's why he 's here .	he 'll pinch my cheek . i hate that .
how would you like to go back to teasing hair , big mouth ?	roger , do you mind if we talk a little business ?
please , please , that 's what we 're here for . be careful , that hurt .	i think this would be a marvelous opportunity for you , roger . up to now , you 've always been associated with musicals , and ...
yes . dopey show-girls in gooey gowns . two-three-kick-turn ! turn- turn-kick-turn ! it 's enough to make you throw up ! at last a chance to do straight drama ! to deal with conflict , with inner truth . roger de bris presents history . of course , i think we should add a little music . that whole third act has got to go . they 're losing the war . it 's too depressing . we 'll have to put something in there . aaahghhh ! i see it ! a line of beautiful girls , dressed as storm troopers , black patent leather boots , all marching together ... two-three-kick-turn ! turn-turn- kick-turn !	that 's genius . that 's genius . roger , i think i speak for mr. bloom and myself when i say that you 're the only man in the world who can do justice to springtime for hitler .
wait a minute . this is a very big decision . it might effect the course of my entire life . i 'll have to think about it . i 'll do it .	congratulations .
wait ! this is boomerang . this is boomerang .	what are you saying ?
`` by the light , by the light ,	`` of the silvery moon ,
`` of the silvery mooooon ,	`` i want to croon ,
`` he wants to croon , he wants to croon ,	`` to my honey i 'll croon ,
`` he 's gon na croon love 's tune ,	`` honeymoon ,
`` honeymoon , honeymoon ,	`` keep a shining in ...
enough . it 's better . please , lambchop , it 's better . stop . you 're hurting it again .	how do you do . i mean ... excuse me ... i mean ...
you mean ooops , do n't you ? say ooops and get out .	i 'll wait in the hall ...
oooooooops !	ooooooops .
uh ... uh ... ooooooops ?	who are you ? what do you want ? why are you loitering in my hallway ? speak , dummy , speak ! why do n't you speak ?
all right . get a hold of yourself . take a deep breath , let it out slowly and tell me who you are .	i 'm leo bloom , i 'm an accountant , i 'm from whitehall and marks , i was sent here to do your books and i 'm terribly sorry i caught you with the old lady .
yes sir .	then account for yourself ! do you believe in god ? do you believe in gold ? why are you looking up old lady 's dresses ? bit of a pervert , eh ?
but sir , i 'm not condem ...	shut up . i 'm having a rhetorical conversation . how humiliating . max bialystock . max bialystock .
you have exactly ten seconds to change that disgusting look of pity into one of enormous respect . one ... two ...	do the books ! do the books !
yes , sir . thank you .	window 's so filthy , ca n't tell if it 's day or night out there .
look at that . a white rolls royce . that 's it baby , when you got it , flaunt it .	koff , koff ... ahem , ahem ... harrumph ...
i assume you are making those cartoon noises to attract my attention . am i correct in my assumption , you fish-faced enemy of the people ?	i have hurt your feelings .
good , what is it ?	sir , may i speak to you for a minute ?
go ! you have fifty-eight seconds .	well , sir , it seems ...
you have forty-eight seconds left . hurry . hurry .	in looking at your books , i 've discovered that ...
what is that ? a handkerchief ?	it 's nothing ... nothing .
here , do n't panic .	i 'm sorry ... i do n't like people touching my blue blanket . it 's not important . it 's a minor compulsion . i can deal with it if i want to . it 's just that i 've had it ever since i was a baby and ... and ... i find it very comforting .
they come here . they all come here . how do they find me ?	mr. bialystock ...
this is hardly a time for levity . i 've discovered a serious error here in the accounts of your last play .	where ? what ?
according to the backer 's list you raised $ 60,000 . but the show you produced only cost fifty-eight thousand . there 's two thousand dollars unaccounted for .	i went to a turkish bath , who cares ? the show was a flop . what difference does it make ?
it makes a great deal of difference . that 's fraud . if they found out , you could go to prison .	why should they find out ? it 's only two thousand dollars , bloom , do me a favor , move a few decimal points around . you can do it . you 're an accountant . the word 'count ' is part of your title .
but that 's cheating !	it 's not cheating ... it 's charity . bloom , look at me ... look at me ! i 'm drowning . other men sail through life . bialystock has struck a reef . bloom , i 'm going under . i am being sunk by a society that demands success , when all i can offer is failure . bloom , i 'm reaching out to you . do n't send me to jail . help ! help !
help !	all right . i 'll do it . i 'll do it .
thank you , bloom . i knew i could con you .	oh , it 's all right ... wha ?
nothing . nothing . do it . do it .	now let 's see , two thousand dollars . that is n't much . i 'm sure i can hide it somewhere . after all , the department of internal revenue is n't interested in a show that flopped .
yes . right . good thinking . you figure it out . i 'm tired . i 'm gon na take a little nap . wake me if there 's a fire .	now let 's see , if we add these figures , we get ...
yes , what ?	what you were saying . keep talking .
what was i saying ?	you were saying that under the right circumstances , a producer could make more money with a flop than he could with a hit .
yes , it 's quite possible .	you keep saying that , but you do n't tell me how . how could a producer make more money with a flop than with a hit ?
assume away !	well , it 's very easy . you simply raise more money than you really need .
what do you mean ?	you 've done it yourself , only you did it on a very small scale .
what did i do ?	you raised two thousand more than you needed to produce your last play .
so what ? what did it get me ? i 'm wearing a cardboard belt .	ahhhhhh ! but that 's where you made your error . you did n't go all the way . you see , if you were really a bold criminal , you could have raised a million .
but the play only cost $ 60,000 to produce .	exactly . and how long did it run ?
see ? you could have raised a million dollars , put on a sixty thousand dollar flop and kept the rest .	but what if the play was a hit ?
oh , you 'd go to jail . if the play were a hit , you 'd have to pay off the backers , and with so many backers there could never be enough profits to go around , get it ?	aha , aha , aha , aha , aha , aha ! ! so , in order for the scheme to work , we 'd have to find a sure fire flop .
what scheme ?	what scheme ? your scheme , you bloody little genius .
oh , no . no . no . i meant no scheme . i merely posed a little , academic accounting theory . it 's just a thought .	bloom , worlds are turned on such thoughts !
mr. bialystock . no . wait . please . you 're holding me too tight . i 'm an honest man . you do n't understand .	no , bloom , you do n't understand . this is fate , this is destiny . there 's no avoiding it .
oh , i fell on my keys . i 've got to get out of here .	you miserable , cowardly , wretched little caterpillar . do n't you ever want to become a butterfly ? do n't you want to spread your wings and flap your way to glory ?
you 're going to jump on me .	you 're going to jump on me . i know you 're going to jump on me -- like nero jumped on poppea .
what ? ? ?	poppea . she was his wife . and she was unfaithful to him . so he got mad and he jumped on her . up and down , up and down , until he squashed her like a bug . please do n't jump on me .
i 'm not going to jump on you !	aaaaaaaaaa !
will you get a hold on yourself .	do n't touch me ! do n't touch me !
what are you afraid of ? i 'm not going to hurt you ! what 's the matter with you ?	i 'm hysterical . i 'm having hysterics . i 'm hysterical . i ca n't stop . when i get like this , i ca n't stop . i 'm hysterical .
what can i do ? what can i do ? you 're getting me hysterical .	go away from me . you frighten me . sit over there .
okay . i 'm way over here . is that better ?	it 's a little better , but you still look angry .
good . good . that 's nice . that 's very nice . i think i 'm coming out of it now . yes . yes . i 'm definitely coming out of it . thank you for smiling . it helped a great deal .	well , you know what they say , `` smile and the world smiles with you . '' heh , heh . the man should be in a straight jacket . feeling better ?
much , thank you . but i am a little lightheaded . maybe i should eat something . hysterics have a way of severely depleting one 's blood sugar , you know .	they certainly do . they certainly do . come , let me take you to lunch .
i got it , mr. bialystock .	thank you , leo . and call me max . you know , i do n't let everybody call me max . it 's only people i really like .
okay ... max ! and you can call me leo .	i already have . come on .
where would you like to eat ?	well , max , i do n't know , max . what do you think , max ?
let me see ... it 's such a beautiful day . why waste it indoors . i 've got it ! let 's go to coney island ! we 'll lunch at the sea shore .	coney island ? ?
what 's the matter , leo ? do n't you like coney island ?	i ... i love it . i have n't been there since i was a kid . but it 's nearly two o'clock . i really should be getting back to whitehall and marks .
nonsense ! as far as whitehall and marks are concerned , you 're working with bialystock , right ?	right .
what kind now , leo ?	i do n't know . let 's see . we 've had chocolate , vanilla , banana - let 's go green .
everybody 's a big shot . well , leo , are you having a good time ?	i do n't know . i think so . i feel very strange .
maybe you 're happy .	yes . that 's it . happy . well , whatta ya think of that . happy .
you think you 're not in prison now ? living in a grey little room . going to a grey little job . leading a grey little life .	you 're right . you 're absolutely right . i 'm a nothing . i spend my life counting other people 's money -- people i 'm smarter than , better than . where 's my share ? where 's leo bloom 's share ? i want , i want , i want , i want everything i 've ever seen in the movies !
you bet your boots , leo . it 's bialystock and bloom -- on the rise . upward and onward . say , you 'll join me . nothing can stop us .	i 'll do it ! by god , i 'll do it !
you ca n't feel it when it 's in your hand , when it 's in your pocket .	max , what is it ? what are you doing ? what 's happening ?
i 'll tell you what 's happening . we 've struck gold . not fool 's gold , but real gold . the mother lode . the mother lode . the mother of them all .	you found a flop !
it wo n't run a week !	run a week ? are you kidding ? this play has got to close in the first act .
max , i do n't want to take any siegfried oath . i do n't know what it is , but i do n't want to take it . we might end up in the german army .	shut up , you idiot . he 's a harmless nut . play along with him . it 's almost in the bag .
there it is ... in red and white ! `` springtime for hitler , '' signed , sealed and delivered . what 's the matter with you ?	look , i 'm just not wearing this arm band . i do n't care how big the deal is .
mrs. eleanor biddlecombe . she also owns 50 % of the profits .	mrs. virginia resnick . she also owns 50 % of the profits .
mrs. alma wentworth . she owns 100 % of the profits .	leo , what if this play is a hit ?
then the department of justice owns 100 % of bialystock and bloom .	oi . i 'm depressed . leo , do me a favor . open the safe . i want to see the money .
what are you doing ?	i 'm going to buy a toy . i worked very , very hard and i think i deserve a toy .
how do you do . have you gone mad ? a receptionist that ca n't speak english . what will people say ?	they 'll say , `` oooh , wah , wah , wah , ooh , ooh . ''
what is she gon na do here ?	i 'll show you . ulla , go to work .
max , as i was saying , maybe we should go easy on the spending . i mean these offices and everything .	why ? take it when you can get it ! flaunt it , baby , flaunt it !
but if something should ... god forbid ... go wrong , at least we could give them some of their money back . it would look better in court .	stop talking like that , you white mouse ! nothing 's going to go wrong . as a matter of fact , today i have taken steps to insure total disaster . at two o'clock we have an appointment with none other than roger de bris .
roger de bris . roger de bris . oh yes , the director . is he good ... i mean bad ?	roger de bris is the worst director that ever lived .
do you think he 'll take the job ?	only if we ask him .
well , it 's ... uh ... it 's nice and long ... i mean , it 's ... uh ... uh ... where do you keep your wallet ?	it 's gorgeous . absolutely gorgeous . you could n't have picked a better color . it brings out your eyes . let 's face it , roger , that dress is you .
so much for nutsy fagin .	here comes the times drama critic .
to failure !	to failure !
maybe it 's not true !	no way out . no way out .
bloom , bloom , maybe it 's not true .	no way out . no way out . what ? who ?
why do n't we go over to the theatre and see what 's really happening ? after all , we 've only heard from a small portion of the audience . let 's hear what the majority thinks .	the majority . the majority . yes . let 's hear from the majority .
what are you doing with those books ? where are you going ?	i 'm turning myself in . it 's the only way . i 'm going to cooperate with the authorities . they 'll reduce my sentence and then there 's time off for good behavior . and maybe i 'll get a job in the prison library . so long .
i never should have listened to you .	ohhhhhhhhh , how i hate you .
here . buy bullets . kill . kill them all !	what ? ? ?
they are ? have you ever eaten with one ? liebkind , go ! kill !	liebkind , no !
max , i ...	what is it ?

do n't help me .	he 's a liar and a cheat and a scoundrel . he 's taken money from little old ladies . he 's talked people into doing things they never would have dreamed of . especially me . but who has he really hurt ?
i vas never a member of the nazi party . i am not responsible . i only followed orders . who are you ?	mr. liebkind , wait . you do n't understand .
vhy do you persecute me ? my papers are in order . i love my country . `` oh , beautiful for spacious skies , for amber vaves of grain . ''	mr. liebkind , wait ...
`` i 'm a yankee doodle dandy ...	mr. liebkind , relax , relax , we 're not from the government . we came here to talk to you about your play .

oh , sure . i used to take him his hot milk and his opium . achhh , those were the days . vat good times ve had . dinner parties vit lovely ladies and gentlemen , singing und dancing . you know , not many people knew about it , but the fuhrer vas a terrific dancer .	really , i never dreamed ...
that 's because you were taken in by that verdampter allied propaganda . such filthy lies . but nobody said a bad vord about winston churchill , did they ? oh no , vin vit vinnie ! churchill , vit his cigars and his brandy and his rotten paintings . could n't even say nazi . he would say narzis , narzis . ve vere not narzies , ve vere nazis . but let me tell this , and you 're getting it straight from the horse , hitler vas better looking than churchill , he vas a better dresser than churchill , had more hair , told funnier jokes , and could dance the pants off churchill !	that 's exactly why we want to do this play . to show the world the true hitler , the hitler you knew , the hitler you loved , the hitler with a song in his heart .
wait . no . how do i know i can trust you ? how do i know you vill present this play in the manner and spirit in vhich it vas conceived ?	we swear it !
not good enough ... vould you be villing to take the siegfried oath ?	yes . we would !
you think out of all those hitlers you could find just one ...	it was the same thing in germany . we looked for years before we found the right hitler .
vaaaat ? ? ?	franz , do n't you see , hitler was a man of his time . this is a man of his time .
but he has long hair !	do n't look at the outside , look at the inside . it 's the inner hitler we 're after . the young beautiful hitler , who danced his way to glory .
franz , trust me . i promise i wo n't let you down .	all right , but remember , if you damage the fuhrer 's reputation , i kill you .
not .	cowards , miserable cringing cowards . clinging to life like baby butterflies . vatch , vatch and remember . franz liebkind vill show you how to die like a man !

what did you tell the people ?	i told them we invaded england .
hey , baby , that 's good ! how 'd we come out ?	we won .
i always forget to put the sign on , but we do have vacancy . twelve in fact . twelve cabins , twelve vacancies .	in the past two days i 've been to so many motels , my eyes are bleary with neon . this is the first one that looked like it was hiding from the world at large .
i do n't really forget the sign , it just does n't seem ... any use . this used to be the main highway . want to register , please ?	sit down . i do n't want to trouble you , just want to ask ...
you out to buy a motel ?	no .
oh . i thought ... you said you 'd been to so many in two days ... what was it you wanted to ask ?	i 'm looking for a missing person . my name 's arbogast , private investigator ... trying to trace a young girl who 's been missing almost a week . from phoenix . it 's a private matter ... family wants to forgive her ... she is n't in trouble .
i did n't think the police went searching for people who were n't in trouble .	i 'm not the police .
we have reason to believe she came this way ... might have stopped in this area ... did she stop here ?	no . no one has stopped here in weeks ...
mind looking at the picture before committing yourself ?	committing myself to what ? you sure talk like a policeman .
no . at least i do n't recall .	she might have used an alias . mary crane 's the real name , but she might 've registered ...
now there 's a couple even remarking about your sign , and see how easily you forgot them ?	what ?
do n't know where she got `` marie , '' but `` samuels '' figures . her boy friend 's name is sam . was she in disguise ? or do you want to check the picture again ?	i did n't lie to you . i just have trouble keeping track of ... time .
it was raining and her hair did n't look like that ... damped out , i guess .	tell me all about her .
she arrived kind of late , wet and hungry and she was very tired and went right to bed and left early .	how early ?
very early . dawn .	of which morning ?
the following morning . sunday .	no one met her ?
no .	or arrived with her .
no .	she did n't call anyone ? even locally ?
no .	you did n't spend the whole night with her did you ?
no ! of all ...	how do you know she did n't make a call ?
she was tired . she said she had a long drive ahead of her , in the morning ... yes , now i 'm remembering very clearly because i 'm picturing . when you make a picture of the moment in your mind , you can remember every detail . she was sitting back there , no she was standing up , with some sandwich still in her hand , and she said she had to drive a long way .	back where ?
what do you mean ?	you said she was sitting `` back there , '' or standing rather ...
oh . my private parlor . she had an awful hunger ... so i made her some supper . and then she went to bed and left in the morning . i did n't even see her leave .	how did she pay you ?
what ?	cash or check ? for the cabin ...
cash .	and when she left , she never came back .
why should she ? i 'm sorry , i have work to do , mr ... if you do n't mind ...	i do mind . if it do n't jell , it ai n't aspic ! this ai n't jelling .
i do n't know what you expect me to know about ... people come and go ...	she is n't still here , is she ?
not at all !	suppose i wanted to search the cabins , all twelve ... would i need a warrant ?
i guess i 've got one of those faces you ca n't help believing .	anyone at home ?
i live there . alone .	someone is sitting in that window .
she 's ... ill. confined to her room . it 's practically living alone .	if this girl mary crane were here , you 'd have no reason to hide her would you ?
of course not .	if she paid you well ?
now , look ... !	or if she had you say ... gallantly protecting her ... you would n't be fooled ... you 'd know she was just using you . would n't you ?
i 'm not a fool ! and i 'm not capable of being fooled ! not even by women !	i did n't mean that as a slur on your manhood . i 'm sorry .
that 's all right . maybe she could have fooled me . but ... she did n't fool my mother .	your mother met her ? can i talk to your mother ?
no . i told you , she 's confined ...	just for a moment . she might have picked up a hint you 'd miss .
sick old women are sharp . come on , i wo n't disturb ...	no ! just no ! i have one of those breaking points like any other man , believe it or not , and i 'm near it . there 's just so much pushing i can take and i think ...
let 's all talk about mary .	who are you , friend ?
what 's your interest ?	money .
somebody better tell me what 's going on and tell me fast ! i can take so much and then ...	your girl friend stole forty thousand dollars .
why ?	must 've needed it .
did you check in phoenix ... hospitals ... maybe she had an accident ... a hold-up ...	she was seen leaving town in her car . seen by her very victims , i might add .
i do n't know .	would n't have been able to tail you if you did .
someone has seen her . someone always sees a girl with forty thousand dollars . she is your girl friend , is n't she ?	sam , they do n't want to prosecute , they just want the money back . it was all in cash ...
casharoonie !	sam , if she 's here ...
you came up here on a hunch , miss crane ? nothing more ? no phone call ... from him , or from your sister herself ?	not even a hunch . just hope .
with a little checking , i could get to believe you .	i do n't care if you do or ... i want to see mary ... before she gets in any deeper ...
i 'm in no mood for trouble !	what ?
there 's an old saying , `` first customer of the day is always the most trouble ! '' but like i said , i 'm in no mood for it so i 'm just going to treat you so fair and square you wo n't have one human reason to give me ...	can i trade in my car and take another ?
you can do anything you 've a mind to ... and bein ' a woman , you will ! that yours ?	yes , it 's ... nothing wrong with it , i 'm just ...
sick of the sight of it ! well , suppose you look around for something that strikes your eyes and meanwhile i 'll have my mechanic give yours the once over and ... want some coffee ? i was just about ...	no . thank you . i 'm in ... a hurry . i just want to make a change and start ...
that 's the one i'd 've picked for you myself !	how much ?
go ahead ! spin it around the block . now i know you do n't know anything about engine condition , but you can feel , ca n't you ... and it 's all in the feel , believe me , you feel that one around the block ...	it looks fine . how much will it be , with my car ... ?
you mean you do n't want the usual day and a half to think it over ? you are in a hurry ! somebody chasin ' you ?	of course not . please .
well ... heck , this is the first time i ever saw the customer high-pressure the salesman ! i 'd figure roughly ... ... your car plus five hundred .	five hundred .
aha ! always got time to argue money , huh ... ?	all right .
i take it ... you can prove that car 's yours ... i mean , out of state and all ... got your pink slip and your ...	i think i have the necessary papers . is there a ladies room ...
i think you 'd better give it a trial spin . do n't want any bad word of mouth about california charlie .	i 'd really rather not . please . ca n't we just settle this and ...
i 'll be perfectly honest with you , ma'am . it 's not that i do n't trust you , but ...	but what ? is there anything so terribly wrong about ... making a decision and wanting to hurry ? do you think i 've stolen ... my car ?
no , m'am . i was only about to say , i 've sent my mechanic out to give your car a little test ... that 's all .	i 'd like to be ready when he gets back .
is n't mr. lowery back from lunch ?	he 's lunching with the man who 's buying the harris street property , you know , that oil lease man ... so that 's why he 's late . you getting a headache ?
it 'll pass . headaches are like resolutions ... you forget them soon as they stop hurting .	you got aspirins ? i have something ... not aspirins , but my mother 's doctor gave these to me the day of my wedding . teddy was furious when he found out i 'd taken tranquilizers !
were there any calls ?	teddy called . me ... and my mother called to see if teddy called . oh , and your sister called to say she 's going to tucson to do some buying and she 'll be gone the whole weekend and ...
are n't you going to take the pills ? they 'll knock that headache out .	i do n't need pills ... just sleep .
yes , mr. lowery .	caroline ... ? mary still is n't in ?
no , mr. lowery ... but then she 's always a bit late on monday mornings .	buzz me the minute she comes in .
call her sister ! if no one 's answering at the house ... .	i called her sister , mr. lowery , where she works , the music makers music store , you know ? and she does n't know where mary is any more than we do .
you better run out to the house . she may be ... unable to answer the phone ...	her sister 's going to do that . she 's as worried as we are .
will you help us ? i think something 's wrong out there !	now . your sister is missing how long ?
she left phoenix a week ago yesterday . and no trace until ...	how 'd you and this detective come to trace her to fairvale ?
yes .	she ai n't missing so much as she 's run away .
she stole some money .	a lot ?
forty thousand dollars .	and the police have n't been able to ...
mary had been there , one night , and had left .	with the forty thousand dollars ?
he did n't mention the money . what he said on the phone is n't important , is it ? he was supposed to come back after he spoke to the mother , and he did n't ! that 's what i want you to do something about !	like what ?
go out there ! find somebody , ask some questions ! i 'm sorry if i seem over-anxious to you . i keep thinking ... something 's wrong . i have to know what !	i think something 's wrong , too , miss . but not the same thing . i think your private detective is what 's wrong . i think he got himself a hot lead as to where your sister was going ... probably from norman bates ... and called you to keep you still while he took off after her and the money .
please !	sorry i got you up , boy . go back to sleep . yeah , be glad to . said to give you his regards .
you should 've called in the police the second you found your sister has skipped . you go starting private investigations , using people you do n't even know ...	what difference does that ...
yes .	norman bates ' mother has been dead and buried in greenlawn cemetery for the last ten years !
did he say anything about my sister ?	just what he told your detective .
i still feel ...	can see you do . sorry i could n't make you feel better . you want to come to my office this afternoon and report a missing person ... and the theft , is what you want to do ! sooner you drop this thing in the lap of the law , that 's the sooner you 'll stand a chance of your sister bein ' picked up . how about that ?
yes ?	may i talk to you ?
i 'm mary 's sister .	lila .
is something wrong ?	i want to know if my sister is here .
here ?	with you .
where ?	i do n't know where . in your store , somewhere in your town ... anywhere .
what 's the matter ?	do n't you know ?
what should i know ?	to begin with , where mary is . do you ?
no . i take it you do n't either ? how long ?	last friday . she left work , and home ... i was in tucson over the weekend ... i have n't heard from her , not even a phone call .
and you thought she 'd come up here , to me ? if she had , what reason would she have for not calling you ?	a good reason , i suppose .
well what do you think , we eloped or something ? or we 're living in sin and ...	mr. loomis , you 're so busy being defensive that you have n't even reacted to the most serious fact of all . mary is missing .
i was getting to that !	what do you know about it ?
nothing ! you 're putting me on the defensive .	look , if you two are in this thing together , i do n't care , it 's none of my business ... but i want to see mary . i want her to tell me she 's all right and it 's none of my business . then i 'll go back to phoenix and ...
what thing ?	huh ?
what thing could we be in together ?	i hate tears .
is mary ... in trouble ?	yes .
well why did n't she come to me ... call me ... ?	not that kind ... you men and your egos .
yes ... i just ... did . the moment they told me ...	you might have doubted for say five minutes or so , sister .
i just listened ... and believed everything they told me . 'she stole the money . ' 'we do n't want to get her in trouble . ' 'no do n't bring the police in ' ...	it was her boss ' idea not to report it to the police ?
no . the man whose money she ... he talked so loud and fast , and i ... i should 've called the police .	he must have had a darn good reason for wanting them kept out of it ... all that cash ...
i ought to call the police right now !	no .
why not ? sam , is she hiding here ? are you two planning to go away with the money ?	how could i go away ? i 'm in debt up to my ... if she did steal that money ... it 's hard to believe she did because it 's hard to see why she would . unless she had some wild idea that it would help me ... us ...
she have n't even called you ?	i did n't see her ... and i did n't hear from her ! believe that !
i need to ... i need to believe something . this is the first time i 've ever come up against anything i could n't ... understand .	you 've led a charmed life .
no . i just think ... anything can be explained . but mary , doing a thing like this ... i do n't know how to handle ...	maybe we can handle it together .
i came flying up here expecting to get some explanation ... for all i know , she may be trying to get in touch with me , at home . i 'd better go home .	i think she 'll contact me if she contacts anybody . why do n't you stay here . when she shows up ... or calls ... be here .
you want me to stay here ?	she 'll need both of us .
where ... can i stay ?	first rate hotel , fifty yards up the street . come on . after we check you in we 'll go to the drugstore and get you a sandwich . then we 'll come back here ... and wait .
sometimes saturday night has a lonely sound . ever notice , lila ?	sam . he said an hour . or less .
it 's been three .	are we just going to go on sitting here ?
he 'll be back . let 's sit still and hang on , okay ?	you have an awfully nice habit , sam .
hundreds ! which one is your pet ?	whenever i start contemplating the panic button , your back straightens up and your eyes get that god-looks- out-for-everybody look and ... i feel better .
i feel better when you feel better .	where 's the old highway ?
you want to run out there , bust in on arbogast and the sick old lady , shake her up and maybe spoil everything arbogast 's been building for the last three hours .	yes .
that would n't be a wise thing to do .	patience does n't run in our family . sam , i 'm going out there !
arbogast said ...	an hour ! or less !
got the number of the motel out on the old highway ? bates , i think .	sam ! why call when we can go ?
probably on his way back right now .	sam , i 'm going .
stay here .	why ca n't i go out there with you ?
i do n't know ... one of us has to be here in case arbogast 's on the way .	just wait here ?
he did n't come back here ?	sam .
no arbogast . no bates . and only the old lady at home ... a sick old lady unable to answer the door ... or unwilling .	where could he have gone ?
maybe he got some definite lead . maybe he went right on ...	without calling me ?
in a hurry .	sam , he called me when he had nothing definite , nothing but a dissatisfied feeling . do n't you think he 'd have called if he had anything ...
let 's go see al chambers .	who 's he ?
our deputy sleeps .	well ?
nothing . just ... all the lights out ... must be asleep .	does that mean we ca n't ...
no , thank you . it 's my problem , too .	i do n't know where to start ... except at the beginning .
yes .	this is lila crane , from phoenix . she 's been here for a few days , looking for her sister . there 's a private detective helping ... and , well , we got a call tonight , from this detective , saying he 'd traced mary ...
i 've only been here five . right now it feels like ten , but ...	all right ! then call ! at least , call !
maybe i am the seeing-illusions type .	you 're not .
i wo n't feel satisfied unless i got out there , sam .	neither will i .
i wonder if we 'll ever see mary again .	of course we will .
where 'd you go to college ?	i did n't . i got a job , too . i wonder if that hurt her , my not letting her sacrifice for me ? some people are so willing to suffer for you that they suffer more if you do n't let them .
i wonder so many things about her now . why she never told me about you ... funny , when you think there 's an answer to everything , you think you know all the answers .	we were going to get married . are going to get married !
do you know how i found out about you ? i found one of your letters ... it was a nice letter , sam .	this is the old highway .
i suppose ... when you were able to marry her she 'd have presented you , all shiny and proper ... she always tried to be proper .	watch your tenses .
huh ?	she always tries to be proper .
you going to wait here for me ?	i 'm going with you . but we 'd better decide what we 're going to say and do when we walk in ...
we 're going to register . as man and wife . and get shown to a cabin ... and then search every inch of that place , inside and ... outside .	you wo n't believe it ... but this will be the first time i 've ever pulled one of those man- and-wife-renting-cabin capers !
i wonder where norman bates does his hermiting ?	someone was at that window . i saw the curtain move .
we should have asked for cabin one ... the one mary was in .	i 'm glad we did n't .
we have to go into that cabin and search it , sam ... no matter what we 're afraid of finding and no matter how much it may hurt .	i know . do you think if something happened , it happened there ?
sam , if you owned a useless business like this motel ... one you probably could n't even sell ... what would you need to get away , to start a new business , somewhere else ? forty thousand dollars ?	how could we prove ... well , if he opens a new motel on the new highway ... say , a year from now ...
there must be some proof that exists right now ! something that proves he got that money away from mary ... some way !	what makes you sound so certain ?
sorry .	hospital clean .
what ?	the bathroom . look at how clean it is . the one in our cabin is clean ... but this is clean !
what is it ?	it did n't get washed down . it 's figuring ... the kind you tear up and get rid of . some figure has been added to or subtracted from ... forty thousand .
that 's proof mary was here ! it would be too wild a coincidence for somebody else to ...	bates never denied mary was here .
yes . but maybe this proves that bates found out about the money .	do we simply ask him where he 's hidden it ?
you ca n't go up there .	why not ?
it 's regular . okay ?	i could stand something regular .
call your boss and tell him you 're taking the rest of the afternoon off . it 's friday anyway ... and hot .	what do i do with my free afternoon , walk you to the airport ?
we could laze around here a while longer .	checking out time is three p.m. hotels of this sort are n't interested in you when you come in , but when your time 's up ... sam , i hate having to be with you in a place like this .
i 've heard of married couples who deliberately spend occasional nights in cheap hotels . they say it ...	when you 're married you can do a lot of things deliberately .
you sure talk like a girl who 's been married .	sam !
i 'm sorry , mary . my old dad used to say 'when you ca n't change a situation , laugh at it . ' nothing ridicules a thing like laughing at it .	i 've lost my girlish laughter .
the only girlish thing you have lost .	sam . this is the last time .
for what ?	this ! meeting you in secret so we can be ... secretive ! you come down here on business trips and we steal lunch hours and ... i wish you would n't even come .
okay . what do we do instead , write each other lurid love letters ?	i have n't time to argue . i 'm a working girl .
and i 'm a working man ! we 're a regular working-class tragedy !	it is tragic ! or it will be ... if we go on meeting in shabby hotels whenever you can find a tax-deductible excuse for flying down deductible here ...
you ca n't laugh at it , huh ?	can you ?
and besides , when you say i make tax- deductible excuses you make me out a criminal .	you could n't be a criminal if you committed a major crime .
i wish i were . not an active criminal but ... a nice guy with the conscience of a criminal . next best thing to no conscience at all .	i have to go , sam .
i can come down next week .	no .
not even just to see you , to have lunch ... in public ?	we can see each other , we can even have dinner ... but respectably , in my house with my mother 's picture on the mantel and my sister helping me broil a big steak for three !
and after the steak ... do we send sister to the movies and turn mama 's picture to the wall ?	sam ! no !
mary , whenever it 's possible , tax- deductible or not , i want to see deductible you . and under any conditions . even respectability .	you make respectability sound ... disrespectful .
i 'm fed up with sweating for people who are n't there . i sweat to pay off my father 's debts ... and he 's in his grave ... i sweat to pay my ex-wife alimony , and she 's living on the other side of the world somewhere .	i pay , too . they also pay who meet in hotel rooms .
a couple of years and the debts will be paid off . and if she ever re- marries , the alimony stops ... and then ...	i have n't even been married once yet !
yeah , but when you do ... you 'll swing .	sam , let 's go get married .
and live with me in a storeroom behind a hardware store in fairvale . we 'll have a lot of laughs . when i send my ex-wife her money , you can lick the stamps .	i 'll lick the stamps .
you know what i 'd like ? a clear , empty sky ... and a plane , and us in it ... and somewhere a private island for sale , where we can run around without our ... shoes on . and the wherewithal to buy what i 'd like . mary , you want to cut this off , go out and find yourself someone available .	i 'm thinking of it .
how can you even think a thing like that !	do n't miss your plane .
hey , we can leave together ca n't we ?	i 'm late ... and you have to put your shoes on .
dirty night .	you have a vacancy ?
we have twelve vacancies . twelve cabins , twelve vacancies . they moved away the highway .	i thought i 'd gotten off the main ...
your home address . oh , just the town will do .	los angeles .
i want sleep more than anything . except maybe , food .	there 's a big diner about ten miles on up ... just outside fairvale .
am i that close to fairvale ?	fifteen miles . i 'll get your bags .
stuffy in here . well ... the mattress is soft and there 're hangers in the closet and ... stationary with `` bates ' motel '' printed on it in case you want to make your friends back home envious ... and ... the ... over there ... .	the bathroom .
i 'll be in the office if you want anything ... just tap on the wall .	thank you , mr. bates .
you have something most girls never have .	i have ?
there 's no name for it ... but it 's something that , that puts a person at ease .	thank you . again .
you 're not going to go out again and drive up to that diner , are you ?	no .
then will you do me a favor ? will you have supper here ? i was just about to , myself ... nothing more than some sandwiches and a lot of milk , but i 'd like it if you 'd come up to the house and ... i do n't set a fancy table but ... the kitchen 's awful homey .	i 'd like to .
i 've caused you some trouble .	mother ... ... what is the phrase ... `` she is n't herself today '' ... i think that 's it .
i 'm sorry . i wish ... people could apologize for other people .	do n't worry about it . but as long as you 've made us supper , we may as well eat it . huh ?
you 're very ... kind .	it 's all for you . i 'm not hungry . please go ahead .
you eat like a bird .	you 'd know , of course .
it 's a strange hobby . curious , i mean .	uncommon , too .
i imagine so .	it 's not as expensive as you 'd think . cheap , really . needles , thread , sawdust .. the chemicals are all that cost anything .
a man should have a hobby .	it 's more than a hobby ... sometimes ... a hobby is supposed to pass the time , not fill it .
is your time so empty ?	oh , no ! i run the office , tend the cabins and grounds , do little chores for mother ... the ones she allows i might be capable of doing .
you go out ... with friends ?	friends ? who needs friends . a boy 's best friend is his mother . you 've never had an empty moment in your whole life . have you ?
only my share .	where are you going ? i do n't mean to pry ...
i 'm looking for a private island .	what are you running away from ?
why do you ask that ?	no . people never run away from anything . the rain did n't last very long . you know what i think ? i think we 're all in our private traps , clamped in them , and none of us can ever climb out . we scratch and claw ... but only at the air , only at each other , and for all of it , we never budge an inch .
sometimes we deliberately step into those traps .	i was born in mine . i do n't mind it anymore .
you should ... mind it .	oh i do ... but i say i do n't .
if anyone ever spoke to me , the way i heard ... the way she spoke to you , i do n't think i could ever laugh again .	sometimes when she talks that way to me i 'd like to ... curse her out and leave her forever ! or at least , defy her . but i could n't . she 's ill .
she sounded strong ...	i mean ... ill. she had to raise me all by herself after my dad died ... i was only five ... and it must have been a strain . oh , she did n't have to go out to work or anything , dad left us with a little something ... anyway , a few years ago ... mother met a man . he talked her into building this motel ... we could have talked her into anything ... and when . well ... it was just too much for her when he died , too ... and the way he died ... oh , it 's nothing to talk about when you 're eating . anyway , it was too much of a loss for my mother ... she had nothing left .
except you .	a son is a poor substitute for a lover .
why do n't you go away ?	to a private island , like you ?
no , not like me .	it 's too late for me . and besides ... who 'd look after her ? she 'd be alone up there , the fire would go out ... damp and cold , like a grave . when you love someone , you do n't do that to them , even if you hate them . oh , i do n't hate her . i hate ... what she 's become . i hate ... the illness .
an institution ? a madhouse ? people always call a madhouse `` someplace . '' put her in someplace !	i 'm sorry ... i did n't mean it to sound uncaring ...
what do you mean about caring ? have you ever seen one of those places ? inside ? laughing and tears and cruel eyes studying you ... and my mother there ? why ? has she harmed you ? she 's as harmless as ... one of these stuffed birds .	i am sorry . i only felt ... it seemed she was harming you . i meant ...
i 've suggested it myself . but i hate to even think such a thing . she needs me ... and it is n't ... ... it is n't as if she were a maniac , a raving thing ... it 's just that ... sometimes she goes a little mad . we all go a little mad sometimes . have n't you ?	yes , and just one time can be enough . thank you .
thank you , norman .	norman .
you 're not going to ... to your room already ?	i 'm very tired . and i 'll have a long drive tomorrow . all the way back to phoenix .
phoenix ?	i stepped into a private trap back there -- and i want to go back and ... try to pull myself out . before it 's too late for me , too .
why do n't you stay a little while , just for talking .	i 'd like to , but ...
alright . i 'll see you in the morning . i 'll bring you breakfast . what time will you ...	very early . dawn .
alright , miss ...	crane .
that 's it .	good night .
in quite a hurry .	yes . i did n't mean to sleep so long . i was afraid i 'd have an accident last night , from sleepiness ... so i decided to pull over ...
you slept here all night ?	yes . as i said , i could n't keep my eyes ...
there are plenty of motels in this area . you should have ... i mean , just to be safe ...	i did n't intend to sleep all night ! i just pulled over ... have i broken any laws ?
no , m'am .	then i 'm free to go ... ?
is anything wrong ?	of course not ! am i acting as if ... something 's wrong ?
frankly , yes .	please ... i 'd like to go ...
is there ?	is there what ? i 've told you there 's nothing wrong ... except that i 'm in a hurry and you 're taking up my time ...
in the course of my duty , i never `` take up '' anyone 's time , whether it 's to give a warning , or a ticket , or help ! believe that , m'am . now if you woke up on the wrong side of ... the car seat , that 's one thing . but when you act as if i 've just placed you under arrest ...	i 'm sorry .
wait a minute !	now what ?
may i see your license ?	why ?
oh ?	sorry , mrs. chambers . i hate bothering you ...
we have a problem .	let 's go out back and have some coca while the men are talking .
mary is lila 's sister ?	yes . he traced her to that motel , out on the old highway ...
bates ' motel . he has a mind like a mechanical brain and the more information you feed it ... go on , sam .	he traced her there and called us to say he was going to question mrs. bates ...
norman took a wife ?	no . an old woman , his mother . that was early this evening . and we have n't seen or heard from him since . i went out to the motel , just got back . no one was in the office , and ...
you mean that old woman i saw sittin ' in the window was n't norman bates ' mother ?	maybe you saw mary !
we thought , if you did n't mind , we 'd go out to the motel with you .	he 's already been .
why do n't you call norman and let him say just what happened , if he give the man a hot lead and he did just scooted off ... it 'll make the girl feel better , albert .	at this hour ?
recluse . kinder word .	you must remember that bad business out there . about ten years ago ...
norman ? sheriff chambers . been just fine , thanks . listen , we got some worries here . did you have a man stop out there tonight ... well , this one would n't be a customer , anyway . a private detective , name of ...	arbogast .
barefaced .	he told you he was n't coming right back cause he wanted to question norman bates ' mother , right ?
i helped norman pick out the dress she was buried in . periwinkle blue .	it ai n't only local history , sam , it 's the only murder-and-suicide case in fairvale ledgers ! mrs. bates poisoned this guy she was ... involved with , when she found out he was married , then took a helping of the same stuff herself . strychnine . ugly way to die .
went out before service .	have you two had breakfast ?
just coming up to ring for you .	i suppose you want a cabin .
i 'll take you to ...	better sign in first , has n't we ?
it is n't necessary .	uh , uh ! my boss is paying for this trip ... ninety percent business ... and he wants practically notarized receipts . i better sign in and get a receipt .
i 'll get your bags .	have n't any .
looking for me ?	yes , matter of fact . the wife 's taking a nap and ... i can never keep quiet enough for her ... so i thought i 'd look you up and ... talk .
satisfied with your cabin ?	fine .
i 've been doing all the talking so far , have n't i ?	yes .
i always thought it was the people who are alone so much who do all the talking when they get the chance . yet there you are , doing all the listening ! you are alone here , are n't you ? it would drive me crazy .	that would be a rather extreme reaction , would n't it ?
i 'm not saying you should n't be contented here , i 'm just doubting that you are . i think if you saw a chance to get out from under ... you 'd unload this place ...	this place ! this is n't 'a place . ' it 's my only world . i grew up in that house back there . i was a happy child . my mother and i ... we were more than happy .
my mother is not dead !	i did n't think so .
you look frightened . have i been saying something frightening ?	i do n't know what you 've been saying .
i 've been talking about your mother ... about your motel . how are you going to do it ?	do what ?
buy a new one ! in a new town ! where you wo n't have to hide your mother !	shut up !
where will you get the money to do that , bates ... or do you already have it ... socked away ... a lot of it ...	leave me alone !
... forty thousand dollars !	leave me alone !
i wo n't have you bringing strange young girls in for supper ... ... by candlelight , i suppose , in the cheap erotic fashion of young men with cheap , erotic minds !	mother , please ...
and then what ? after supper , music ? whispers ?	mother , she 's just a stranger ... hungry , and the weather 's bad ...
mother , she 's just a stranger ! as if men do n't desire strangers , as if ... oh , i refuse to speak of disgusting things because they disgust me ! you understand , boy ?	go on , go tell her she 'll not be appeasing her ugly appetite with my food ... or my son ! or do i have to tell her , cause you do n't have the guts ? huh , boy ? you have the guts , boy ?
they thought she 'd be coming to me .	left phoenix under her own steam ?
yes .	from what ?
everyone concerned thought ... if they could get her to give back the money ... they could avoid involving her with the police .	explains the private detective . he traced her to the bates place . what 'd he exactly say when he called you ?
he was out when i was there . if he 's back he probably is n't even in bed yet .	he was n't out when you were there . he just was n't answering the door in the dead of night ... like some people do . this fellow lives like a hermit ...
was that all ?	this detective was out there and norman told him about the girl and the detective thanked him and went away .
now wait a minute , sam . you sure you saw an old woman ?	yes ! in the house behind the motel . i pounded and called but she ... just ignored me .
you did n't find anything .	nothing . here , let 's clear the path .
no mother .	you must 've seen an illusion , sam . now , i know you 're not the seeing- illusion type ... but no woman was illusion there and i do n't believe in ghosts , so there it is !
by gosh , them stiffs are get- tin ' heavier and more of 'em every day . they even got the coroner working overtime .	yeah , between the gangsters and the autos , we wo n't need another war to carry off the population .
you did n't even mention the suicides . did you notice the beaut that came in today ?	did i ?
that 's the one that 's got the coroner doing nightwork .	what -- special autopsy ?
imagine -- she was alive . what a horror . could have been buried alive . she must have run away from the morgue .	never mind your theories . was she ever conscious ?
just before she died she came to --	did she talk ?
said & quot ; doctor & quot ; -- [ something ]	[ was it ] & quot ; meirschultz & quot ; ?
did you wish to see someone ?	i understand my husband is -- your assistant . may i see him please ?
you mean he does n't work for you ?	no , not exactly . why the great anxiety ? it must be something important .
it is -- you know what a struggle he 's had .	indeed , he has often told me .
he 's inherited a fortune .	you say a fortune . he never spoke to me of any rich relatives .
he hardly knew of them him- self . i believe it was his uncle in australia .	i am certainly glad to hear it . i know he 'll be pleased .
do n't tell him . i want to be the first to bring him the news .	that 's only natural . maxwell will be here around eight tonight .
gosh , you had me fooled .	sh -- sh -- i want to have a few words with you quietly .
so -- friendly or otherwise -- ?	[ perfectly friendly , my dear . ] at last , i have really a secure living for us . we can travel or anything we choose .
then you knew of the inheritance ?	sure -- i have one little job to accomplish , then we can leave together . no doubt you are surprised at this disguise .
no , i would n't be surprised at anything from you . winningly . maxwell now , honey -- you are here in time to help me and you can --	i knew there was a catch in this some place -- but spill it . quiet and dramatic . maxwell in the other room , i have a crazy woman that i have been treating .
ha ha , < u > you < /u > have been treating .	quiet , will you ? this is ser- ious . our lives are in danger .
that 's what i said . now , lis- ten to me . i want you to help me take this woman down stairs . i will give her a shot . you can take care of her till i get help .	how about me getting the help . she 's quiet now , is n't she ?
no-	who are you ? what is your name ?
what made you steal ? are you hungry ?	no -- i do n't want to give any money . everybody wants money -- i 'm not going to give any money .
who wants your money -- maybe i can help you .	maybe you want my money , too .
no , i do n't want money . i only want to find out who you are and where you live . my business is finding peo- ple . not taking their money .	you -- a friend to me ?
why , yes , to you , mr. -- mr. -- what ?	i do n't know -- i ca n't tell --
no , no ! i wo n't sign any pa- pers . you ca n't make me --	hm -- pressure -- to buckley . that 's all right . we 'll talk later .
tell me , just what you know of dr. meirschultz .	papers -- they all want me to sign papers .
yes -- i ca n't stand it -- everybody wants papers -- oh , oh	take him to the psychopathic hospital .
sure -- they 're sorta queer , i 'd say . they 's lots of queer goings on up there . they even brought a dog back to life once .	that sounds to me very remarkable .
it may be , but to my notion , those that monkeys with what they got no business to get queer sooner or later .	maybe you 're right .
i know i am . why , i even heard a shot up there last night .	why did n't you notify the police ?
i understand from your neighbors that all [ them ] cats are making noise at night . dr. meirschultz has put in a complaint .	he 's been stealing my cats to experiment on [ them ] . i know cause i 've been [ watching ] spying on him .
[ lot of ] how many cats you have -- what 's the matter -- rats ?	yeah -- thousands , and right in my back yard .
thousands ?	sure , got thousand cats , too . look at 'em -- points to cages of cats .
what ' s the idea [ of wanting so many ] do you sell them [ to the doctor ] ?	oh , no . it 's my own idea . i 'm in the business . in the fur business .
oh , i see . cats ' fur .	that 's it . you get it quick .
but where do the rats come in ?	you 're not as quick as i thought . i figgered out that rats breed faster than cats -- cat skins make good fur -- the cats eat rats . rats eat raw meat . that is , they eat the carcasses of the cats . so -- the cats eat the rats -- the rats eat the cats . and i get the skins -- simple ai n't it ?
oh , him . he has a cat of his own . but his assistant -- he 's the cat-hatenest man i ever saw . goofy , if ya ast me . ]	by the way -- did you hear a shot last night ?
i 'm detective jones . just dropped in to tell you a bit of news .	you found buckley ?
by the way , where < u > is < /u > your assistant ?	oh , maxwell ? he 's left .
how do you do .	well , news of buckley ?
yeah , he was picked up -- also the body from the morgue . say , what did you have to do with stealing that body ?	why , buckley stole that body . that 's what alarmed mrs. buckley so . i have been try- ing to get her to put buckley in an institution but she wants to keep him .
yes indeed . he has been a < u > difficult < /u > case . now that < u > you < /u > have him in custody -- you have him have n't you ?	oh , yes , he 's in good hands now .
fine . mrs. buckley will be all right when she gets used to the idea .	do you have many patients , doctor ?
oh no . mostly research in endocrinology .	mind if i look around ? seems to me you have car- ried on some interesting experiments . sure of himself but taking no chances . maxwell sure , i 'll take you thru .
what 's down there ?	oh , just the basement . some day i intend to build an experimental laboratory down there . it will save me from intrusion .
you here again ?	yes . mr. buckley thinks you treated him a little rough . he 's in the hospital . how about it ?
what 's that ?	oh , nothing . a cou- ple of my patients having a little argument .
take me down there .	it wo n't do any good . they are a pair of would-be mur- deresses fighting it out .
man , you 're crazy . what kind of a place is this ?	oh , < u > i 'm < /u > crazy , am i ? let me tell you something . those women have -- the gleam --
dr. meirschultz , please .	he is n't here .
what are you going to do ?	i 'm going to call the police .
you ca n't double-cross me like that . you were to help me . you were to operate on him . you were going to put him under my power .	not so fast , mrs. buckley . that was your idea !
you are right . but before i can get him back here , you will have to help me .	how ? what can i do ?
[ something very important . i have been threatened ; ] mrs. maxwell , my assistant 's wife , is crazy . she thinks i mur- dered her husband . [ she wants to murder me . ] i want you to help me quiet her -- give her a shot from this hypo . [ keep it hid till we get her ] down in the basement -- there is a secret vault [ there ] . we will put her there till we get your husband -- [ then turn her over to the authorities . then we will both be free . ]	it sounds all right , except for the fact that she 's crazy . it seems to me she has the right idea -- .
what is it ?	the wound is bleeding !
what is it now ?	i 'm losing my blood !
you 're losing your blood ?	yes !
what were you dreaming about ?	a voice ...
that spoke to you ?	that called ... commanded ...
your father ?	yes !
did you hear ?	yes , the child ...
the child !	yes .
there 's no child here .	but ... the dogs ...
there 's no child here , and no dogs either .	no ?
by the time we return there , all the preparations for the blood transfusion are completed .	joseph returns from the room where gisle is . he has evidently succeeded in calming her . he goes and sits in the chair where nikolas sat . he rests his head in his hand . he sees the open diary and begins reading it .
the blood transfusion is now in progress . the only words are curt orders like : 'now ! - quickly ! - that 's enough ! - give it to me ! - sit still ! ' etc .	joseph is reading the diary , which arouses his interest more and more . it is as if he finds a connection between what he reads and the fearful events that have taken place around him . an extract from the diary is shown .
the blood transfusion continues . marc has positioned himself outside the circle of light from the lamp , so that he can see nikolas in bright light , while he himself sits in the dark . nikolas watches lone 's face anxiously and closely during her struggle with death . life slowly seems to return to her , and her breathing becomes more peaceful . she opens her eyes and looks at the people round her , but she is much too enfeebled to speak , and closes her eyes again . marc keeps a close watch on nikolas , who grows paler and paler . his eyes swivel slowly from nikolas to the patient and back to nikolas again .	another fragment of the diary is shown [ having to do with vampires ] .
you killed him ! come on with the rest of it . you killed him !	no -- i did n't . it was igor at the waxworks .
but you were in on it -- you worked for him .	no -- the only thing i did for him was to keep track of the man named worth that runs the place where you arrested me tonight .
you lie !	it 's igor at the wax museum ! you 'll find your judge embalmed in wax ! he 's a statue of voltaire , with all the other corpses ! the whole place is a morgue -- do you hear ? -- a morgue !
yes , why ?	i wondered . did he invite you to lunch , or did you invite him ?
what are you laughing at ?	i just had a picture of you telling a landlady some day that you did n't have the rent , but ralph is awful sweet .
i do n't see any big-moneyed boys running after you .	i met one last night ... all the money this side of peoria .
did you ? where ?	in the can . the hoosegow ! mrs. winton 's little boy . the pawk avenue wintons , you know ... and plenty of do-re-mi . he 's in the jail-house now ...
i do n't have any affairs . what do you mean ?	i do n't think you could have a real affair . you could n't care for anyone .
i 've been in love so many times my heart is calloused ... but i 've never hit one with dough . this love-in-an-attic is n't my idea of a way to spend a pleasant afternoon .	i do n't agree with you .
all right , you raise the kids -- i 'll raise the roof . i 'd rather die with an athletic heart from shaking cocktails and bankers , than expire in a pan of dirty dish water .	you would .
he can look like a chimpanzee and act like an igorot but he must have dough -- plenty of dough .	you think money is the only requisite . it happens that the poor people are happier .
but what about lunch ?	i 'll have it for supper . so long .
there 's no hurry . it 's early .	i ca n't convince the inner woman that we can wait . she 's howling for a bit of ground beef before we drop in on santa claus and the other dummies . i 've only had a cup of coffee since last night .
why did n't you eat last night ?	ouch ! eat ? you can do a solo if you do n't step on it . i 'm going to bow out on you .
what 's the rush ? there 's no first act . they 'll all be there and we do n't have to appear at any particular time .	i 'm hungry . i 'll eat the first child i see . and i 've an appointment with young winton at 8:30 .
you would n't get mixed up with that little rotter , would you ?	no ? give me a chance , baby . money is music in my ears , and when his old man kicks off there 'll be a million dollar tune .
if you 're going to be indiscreet , i wish you 'd be a little more discreet about it . rich men , like winton , love you and leave you .	yeah , but they leave you plenty .
i think so .	well , thank goodness , that 's settled .
disappoint me ? why , what do you mean , dear ?	well , you see , the old chap is pretty anxious to open on schedule . all of his advertising announced the opening tonight .
why , certainly , sir . my fiance . charlotte , may i present mr. igor .	delighted , i 'm sure .
but why ? she 's the best friend i 've got .	she is n't anybody 's friend , and i do n't like you living with her . she 's a bad influence .
nonsense . she 's one of the nicest girls i know .	what 's nice about her ? ... a hard-boiled little gold digger .
i wo n't let you say that !	well , i do say it .
she thinks it 's funny to talk the way she does , but --	do n't kid yourself -- she means it .
are we going to have the same quarrel over again ?	i 'm not quarreling , only ...
you would n't have said that before you met her .	i 'd call it stupid at any time .
well , that 's just how stupid i am . when you go riding , it will be with me . and if it 's with someone else , you can make it a permanent arrangement .	so that 's the way it is ?
that 's the way i feel about it .	i 'm glad you told me . good night , mr. burton .
if you will forgive this poor , crippled stump , my dear , i am very happy to know you .	thank you .
although you would be amused if i were to tell you that i knew you before you were born . before this terrible thing happened to me ... ... i made a very beautiful statue . even if i had not met with this disaster , i could never have hoped to do anything finer , probably nothing quite so fine . and , my child , you are that figure come to life . i wonder , some time , would you pose for one of my sculptors who does very excellent work ?	i 'd love to , at any time .
we 'll be coming to the opening .	at any time . you will always be welcome .
but i think these things are beautiful .	they are . my boy , i think you are right . everyone is tired out today and now that we have seen my doors open in a new country , i am beginning to realize that i am a little tired myself . you can call that fellow in from the front . i think we 'll close for the night .
oh ! mr. igor ! -- i 'm so glad you 're here -- i do n't know why i should be , but i was a little bit afraid .	oh ! so , my little friend , you have honored me by accepting my invitation of last night .
no -- i -- wanted to speak to ralph . we had a silly argument last night and i said something unkind .	oh , you children , you happy children . you 've quarreled and now you 're going to be friends again . and that is as it should be . never let any stupid misunderstandings come between you .
but it was really my fault .	and he will probably demand the life of anyone who agrees with you . let him think it was his fault ... he should be along very shortly .. . but be very stern before you forgive him , especially if it is your fault ... while you 're waiting for your friend , would you like to see some new figures i have downstairs ?
oh , please , mr. igor , i 'm terribly ashamed . i should n't have put you to so much trouble .	it is no trouble at all , my child . this is the strange , vicarious pleasure that remains for me -- to see others enjoy the beauty i used to create . my footing is not too secure .
let me go ! let me go !	we have found immortality , you and i. you must not be afraid .
please , oh , please , i have n't done anything to hurt you .	and i have no desire to hurt you . you will always be beautiful . think , my child , in a thousand years you will be as lovely as you are now .
what ! what are you talking about ?	the body of joan gale !
hello , express . what 's the idea , trying to outsmart the police ?	i 'm not kidding . joan gale 's body is packed in the box in the basement , and i saw the most horrible thing down there .
are you giving me this straight ?	do n't take my word for it . get down there yourself and give a look .
listen , copper , get a load of this . while you 're chinning yourself on a bar rail , i run down this story ... my story . consider yourself my assistant .	what do you think i am ?
whatever you are , you 're the only one of it .	it happens that i 'm the law .
not a very good one , i guess . he was n't like anything human . he hobbled and swayed like a monkey , and the face , from the glimpse i got of it in the light from the street , was like an african war mask .	you mean he was colored ?
hey , what do you think you 're doing ? put that stuff back !	nothing doing . this is my percentage . you birds are going to get yours . and anyhow , i found this dump .
as i live and breathe and wear spats ... the prince .	been doing experiments with scotch and soda again ?
where did you get the news item ? from a little bird ?	yeah . have a pleasant vacation ?
charming . more delightful people crippled .	great . consider yourself crippled -- financially . see if you can jar your charming friends loose from enough to eat on .
meaning what ?	that you 're a sure bet to place in the bread line . there 's no room on this rag for the purely ornamental . you 're easy on the eyes and pretty conceited about it .
i 'm through clowning . you 're all washed up . get out !	what do you mean , you poor ham ! this is new year 's !
all right , what about it ? we get out a paper just the same . did you ever stop to think of that ?	well , is it my fault if nothing happens ?
and how does one go about getting these human documents , may i inquire ?	that is none of our business . but you bring me something for the next edition if it 's only a recipe for spaghetti !
well , ai n't that a shame . nice little chappie that would n't harm a fly ... everybody picking on the little fellow .	if this kid was some unknown soda jerker , they would n't have pinched him . but he 's george winton and they 're playing him up . it 's a roman holiday for every paper hat editor in new york .
why the goose pimples ? if he was n't social register -- if it was somebody like me , you 'd be trying to hang him .	i would n't be trying , beloved . i would hang him ! and another thing , all this gaga about the body disappearing . eight bodies have been stolen in new york within the last eighteen months . does n't it seem more reasonable to hook this up from that angle ?
and ruin a perfectly good story ? do n't be silly .	no , i mean it . i think this kid 's entitled to a break .
he 's getting a break , ai n't he ? he 's front page .	you give me a pain !
i 'm glad to hear it . when did you go in for crusading in the cause of justice ? this lousy mug , with all the money in the world , has had two or three nasty affairs . he 's kept out o ' print because his great- grandfather was smarter than the indians .	well , anyway , he could n't have copped that body -- he was in jail .
you do n't think he 'd be sap enough to do the job himself . i hope they give him the works . even if he did n't kill the kid , he 's responsible for her death , and they can fry him any time without making me sore .	well , i wo n't work on it from that angle .
oh , you wo n't -- you were pretty tough about judge ramsey -- a little while ago --	and they never proved anything against him .
except that he disappeared when things got too hot .	or was bumped off by someone who was afraid of him .
whooey -- he took a run-out powder .	well , that 's got nothing to do with this case . can i handle this my way ?
you can not . i 'm still editor of this sheet .	all right , you said i was fired . well , i quit ! give the assignment to somebody else .
hey , come here , sob-sister !	nope , i 'm through !
on the square , jimmy , if you 'd seen winton down there -- i 'm not holding a brief for him -- maybe he 's a dirty pup , but he 's scared and hysterical -- and so kinda dumb and worthless ...	great ! ... if he 's worthless we 'll give him away as a bridge prize . come on -- beat it . it 's five o'clock . you need some sleep .
no , there 's another point i want to iron out .	sleep on it ... we 'll get it tomorrow .
which one is me ? the horse ?	get out of here .
come in , prussic acid . what 's on your mind ?	i want to see the original pictures of joan gale .
well , why so mysterious ! come on , spill it .	so you can give me an argument and tell me i 'm wrong . do n't be sil , kid .
i am right ! i know i 'm right !	well , no one would ever suspect it . you do n't sound right .
listen , jim -- and if you wisecrack while i 'm talking i 'll crown you with the inkwell .	all right , wise guy . go ahead . spill it .
jim , there 's a little hokey-pokey wax museum opening up down on 14th street .	now do n't that call for an extra !
i asked you to keep your trap shut !	well , you ca n't blame a guy for getting a little breathless with a scoop like that .
all right , you poor baboon , you can guess the rest of it !	no kiddin ' . what 's your idea ?
just this -- i got a look at that dump a little while ago and if they have n't got a wax figure of joan gale in that line-up , then i 'm crazy .	we 'll grant that .
what !	about the gale girl , i mean . where do we go from there ? what of it ?
listen , jo-jo . does this mean anything to you ? joan gale 's body swiped from the morgue -- did you ever hear of such a thing as a death mask ?	i used to be married to one .
and it came to life and divorced you . i know all about that . now my idea is this : somebody swipes the girl 's body , takes impression , makes a mold , produces wax figure ... bingo ! ... peddles it to this old skate down there !	work that up into a comic strip and syndicate it .
let it go .	come down to earth . do you think they would dare do anything like that ? do n't you think they 'd know that figure would be recognized ? shake your head real hard -- you 'll be all right .
all right , master mind . but there 's something cockeyed about that joint and i 'm going to find out what it is .	oh , by the way , another pet theory of yours just blew up .
what do you mean ?	that dear , innocent judge ramsey that you were so sure got bumped off for knowing too much has been located in south america .
no kiddin ' ?	almost certain .
mit me , kid . i 've got a classic .	you here again like an evil spirit to mar my happiness ?
this one 's a story , but i 'm not going to tell you what it is . every time i tell you anything it goes haywire .	what do you mean -- haywire ? you start out after murderers and come back with three-for-a-dime bootleggers . you start to solve murder mysteries and break up crap games . you 're grand ! i 'm for you ! stupendous !
say , you 're always razzing everything i do , but this is one time i 'm in .	go on , little girl , take your troubles somewhere else . i do n't feel like talking to you .
was there any art on judge ramsey ?	what goofy idea have you got now ? do n't tell me you suspect judge ramsey of stealing the body .
listen , stupid , could i do anything that would possibly meet with your approval ?	yes , you could . cut out this rotten business and act like a lady . marry me .
that 's what i said .	i 'm going to get even with you , you dirty stiff ! i 'll do it !
yes , sir . i got in the cab and it was layin ' there on the floor .	where were you going when you got in that cab ?
i do n't remember . not so very far --	do n't remember what day that was , do you ?
you did n't happen to be going to worth 's place , did you ?	no , sir , i 'm sure it was n't there .
you used to go to worth 's place a whole lot . what makes you sure it was n't there ?	well , maybe it was . i do n't remember . you got to do something for me , i ca n't stand it any longer -- i ca n't !
call the homicide squad !	how 's every little thing ?
fine . you 're the first reporter in here for two hours . you people seeing the old year out ?	i 'm people which the old year saw out . i 'm canned , fired !
no kiddin ' .	i 've got to make news , if i have to bite a dog . hey , kelly ! oh , mi gosh , even he walked out on me .
i 've got a story for you . you know the joan gale girl ?	yes , she committed suicide yesterday . that 's not news . i heard about it last year .
oh , yeah ? maybe she did n't commit suicide . she may have been murdered !	no foolin ' -- any suspect ?
do you know george winton ?	old howard winton 's cub ?
that 's the one .	they do n't suspect < i > him < /i > ?
do n't they ? he 's down at the tombs right now .	say , if you 're stringin ' me , old-timer ...
why would i string y ' ? they were sweeties until a month ago .	what does that prove ?
nothing . only she may have tried to blackmail him . you know such things have happened . anyway , he was at her apartment a few hours before she was found dead .	hotcha ! saved , one job !
make it snappy , colonel .	there 's an autopsy ordered at bellevue immediately . you better skip over there .
do n't give this to anybody else , will you ?	it 's all yours .
where 'd you get the stag hound ?	he 's not a stag hound . his name is kelly and he 's a police dog .
what do you mean police dog ?	plain-clothes man . come on , slaves , drink and be merry for tomorrow you might be appointed correspondent to washington ... a fate worse than death .
listen , flo , cut it out . hard-tack is pretty sore .	ai n't that something . the mad monk of manhattan . here goes nothing . listen to the animal cracker roar like a lion .
i told you he was a sore .	stories scarcer than caviar at a street cleaner 's banquet , and he says , bring me a yarn . all i have to do is get a story .
fine , thanks .	gee , honey-bunch , i 'm sorry -- i 'm going to have to disappoint you .
he might get some publicity out of it .	no use . he 's a crab , i tell you .
nix , flo -- he wo n't let you in and you 'll only get me in dutch .	horsefeathers !
what are you people doing out in the middle of the night ?	i 'm after news , as usual . i wonder if it would be all right for me to slip in and look around your factory ?
well , i 'll tell you a secret . i kinda like the old gent and i 'm trying to build a special sunday magazine story out of him . it might help him a whole lot . but that 's a side issue -- something i do on my own time .	gee , that 's great . after the bad opening that night the old boy was pretty blue . this will pep him up . have you told him about it ?
ralph , come here a minute , will you ?	better cut that out . that 's what happens to girls who bite their nails . what 's wrong ?
yeah . i suppose you people will crucify me for something i did n't do . i did n't ! you understand that ! ... i did n't do it ! she -- tried before --	come on , old man , that wo n't do . you know you 're innocent until proven guilty .
listen , kid . you 're in a tough spot , and you can make it a whole lot easier for yourself if you cut out the cry-baby stuff --	cry-baby ?
that 's what i said .	my lawyers will be on the job in a little while , and i warn you people anything you print about me you 've got to prove . dad wo n't stand for --
your dad has stood for plenty . now let 's get down to cases . when did you see the dale girl last ?	for a few minutes the afternoon before -- before --
hmmm . why did n't you tell that to the police ?	they did n't give me a chance . we had a couple of drinks and she was all right then . she seemed happy .
uh-huh . do you remember what she said ? what did you talk about ?	she laughed and told me that we were being silly , that we did n't care for each other any more but we need n't hate each other ... ... she said she wanted to be friends .
i see . was that all she said ?	we planned a trip for her . i was going to send her to bermuda .
you were n't going with her ?	no . why did n't i take her out somewhere ? but she was laughing and seemed so happy .
well , let 's get back to the case in hand . they ordered an autopsy and discovered her body had been stolen from the morgue .	stolen ! what are you trying to do to me ? ... you 're working with the police ! ... you 're trying to make me say something that can be used against me ! you 're trying ...
hold on , hold on . i 'm trying to help you , if you 're on the square , and i think you are .	then why are you telling me a crazy lie ? ...
that happens to be the truth .	who 'd steal her body ?
now look here . it 's not up to us to do our own detective work . i 've had enough trouble over this matter . i do n't want anything more to do with it .	not even if it gives you a clean bill of health ?
not even then . the police are the proper people to conduct this affair . now if you 've got any suspicions i 'll drive you to the nearest police station .	what ! and let every rag in town grab a red-hot story ? not so you could notice it ! now , look , i want you to drive me around the corner and wait for me .
i told you i did n't want to mix in it .	all right , brother . then you can go to some nice warm place , and i do n't mean california .
please . i 'm sorry . i 'll see it through . what do you want me to do ?	i told you what to do . drive around the corner out of sight of the house . i want to get a closer look at the place .
there she is ! you 'll find joan gale in that box .	no -- no -- i -- i -- i do n't want to see it .
why ?	you go in for dangerous things .
-- and so determined to live that i 'm going to get out and take a taxi if you do n't watch where you 're going .	i suppose this is going to sound absurd . i 've only known you twenty-four hours , but i 'm in love with you .
it does n't usually take that long , but i 'll forgive you -- you were in a tough spot when i met you .	no , really -- i 'm crazy about you .
oh , is that what caused it ?	you do n't believe me . you think i 'm just talking . will you marry me ?
how much money have you got ?	heaven knows . a lot .
what is it ? what happened ?	do n't ask any questions . come on !
you are too gracious . these things have some merit , i suspect ... but this -- ... i am convinced , is fine .	even those delicate veins , the texture of this flesh -- i have never seen anything more exquisite .
my partner believes that i should build a horror chamber , immortalizing the hideous crimes and criminals of london . at such times marie antoinette has reassured me , she has promised me recognition for the devotion i gave to her .	she will undoubtedly keep her promise . if you 'll grant me the privilege , i 'd like to submit this work to the royal academy when i get back .
you will have won the undying gratitude of us all . is that not so , marie antoinette ?	i regret i ca n't spend the time i 'd like with your exhibition , but i 'm going to worry the life out of you when i come back .
it will always afford me great pleasure to see you .	good night , sir .
i came back for some of the books . i am trying to straighten out the accounts . i do n't hope to impress you , but i may as well tell you : we have n't a farthing !	that is unfortunate .
your money may have been well invested , my friend . something important may come of all this .	something important has got to come of it ! do you know that the rent on this place is n't paid ?
is that a fact ?	no -- i 'm lying to amuse myself ! now look here , i 've an idea that will get us out of all this . we have n't twopence between us , but we 've got these .
fire insurance !	yes , there 's our way out . a fire in this place would give us ten thousand pounds .
a fire ! is this your idea of humor , my friend ?	i want the money back i 've thrown into this rubbish heap .
i 'm not asking you anything . i 'm telling you what i 'm going to do !	and you think i will permit this , my friend ?
you 've got to permit it ! whose fault is it that no one comes here ? the museum at walston lane does well enough , and why ? they 've got jack the ripper , burke and hare , the mad butcher , the demon barber of fleet street and things people pay to see .	and they are welcome to them . to perpetuate such creatures is to celebrate their crimes .
well , what do you think i 'm in this for ? think of it , man , a match -- a cigar stub -- and ten thousand pounds to divide between us !	you 're insane .
if my curiosity is not too great , would you mind telling me what manner of animal this is you are designing ?	one of the maids-in-waiting for that elizabethan group .
and he is n't struck dead ! this man , he lives ! it would be interesting to know , young man , where and when you studied anatomy .	that does n't seem so bad to me . what is wrong with it ?
everything , my friend . and you hope to be a great sculptor -- a great sculptor . look -- this forearm is at least two inches too long .	but the composition as a whole -- i 've tried to keep a sketchy freedom .
to lunch .	to lunch , you say . i am having coffee and sandwiches sent in . we are not leaving until we have everything ready for the opening .
but i have some friends waiting .	that is unfortunate . they will have to wait .
i will only be gone about half an hour .	if you leave before the work is done , you will be gone for a much longer period ... you will be gone for good .
i would n't feel too disappointed at the slimness of your audience tonight , mr. igor . the weather was against you , and the people are tired and getting over their celebration and preparing to go to work tomorrow .	quite so . quite so . and you , my little friend , my little marie antoinette . it is kind of you to be present .
have you got it ? is it completed ?	yes , sir , it 's here on the truck , but it 's pretty heavy -- i 'll need help .
shall we unpack it ?	yes .
i 'd be glad to , mr. igor . i think i 'll have somethin ' to tell you soon .	you have done well , and now i , too , have something for you . come .
she is the soul of that statue .	i wonder if i could have her pose for me .
what are you laughing at ?	he ca n't hear you .
i 'd know him anywhere .	do n't lose sight of him . this is the most important thing in my life .
yep . everything settled .	good . well , i 'll be seeing you .
i 'm glad they did n't hold you downtown .	they did n't have a leg to stand on . there 's no case against me . it 's a clumsy thing to have happen , but nothing to worry about .
well , any time i can do anything for you --	thanks .
to isolation . to an armed camp . to a biblical spoof of a crazed father firing a gun at his only son .	you taking any medication ?
do n't waste it pauly . this is not an everyday talk . just input the information and ask relevant questions . one : how did a celebrated life of the mind bring me to this particular switching station ?	dad ...
two : what if i did n't miss ?	you did .
spare me your classical answer . measurements in . results taken . what if i did n't miss ?	you did miss --
what was her name ?	excuse me ? ? ?
mia ... ?	yes ... .
i 've been dreaming about you .	day or night ?
could we go somewhere ?	i 'm heading out of town .
what ?	i could go out of town .
could you ?	where to ?
a place you 've never been .	that 's the physicist 's playground .
why am i doing this ?	it 's an experiment .
we flopped the first time out .	at the sub-atomic level , particles obey their own logic . they connect in unimaginable ways .
could be .	what universe are you in , paul ?
nothing is real until it 's perceived .	the buddhists have been saying that for a millennium .
of what ?	god . i dunno . the eternal nothingness . mia .
what did it want ?	that 's what it asked me . `` what do you want ? '' i did n't answer . i was in the middle of an experiment .
no . i did n't . i 'm listening .	inside every semi-conductor ... you have two particles , with opposite charges , separated by an impassable barrier ...
she 's in l.a. , he 's in the bay area --	a five hundred foot thick steel wall . but the connection between these two electrons is so --
dysfunctional --	that they tunnel , magically , through any obstacle , defying the practical laws of physics , in order to end up together --
i did n't want to leave things the way we did . not this time .	wait . i want to tell you something .
i 've been dreaming about this .	then you get it . you 'll understand .
why ?	so i can move on . you too .
yes ?	is rose here ?
she must have gone out for a walk with the children .	well , i got to see her .
she is n't here . and i 'm sorry , but mr. hillyer does n't want her to have callers during working hours .	where is she ?
they 're filthy , mother .	sex is n't ugly , sex is one of the most beautiful things in life , the creative power of the universe is behind it .
i know , mother .	but we must respect that power , we must be in awe of it .
i am in awe of it , mother .	i do n't think you are sufficiently in awe of it . get the castor oil .
oh , mother , not the castor oil .	this is n't punishment , i do n't believe in punishment . it 's for your health . obviously you 're sick if you can act like that .
lots of things . buddy , mostly .	buddy . well , now , that 's a nice name , i like it . i am real pleased to meet you . hey , look , do you think you got a cold drink of ice water somewhere ?
rose , who were those scoundrels in birmingham ?	nobody .
but who were they ?	they were just bad men , that 's all .
in what sense were they bad ?	bad is bad , buddy . there ai n't no sense to it .
was that what they tried to do ? was that why daddy gave you the job , to save you from those scoundrels ?	your daddy is a wonderful man , i 'll say that . he 's the best and most kind-hearted man in the world .
hey , rose , did you hear about that terrible thing down in cave springs ?	what terrible thing in cave springs ?
i did n't hear you . i did n't hear that .	he really did , he ate his little niece . he made pork chops out of her .
i do n't hear you . i just turn my back on that kind of talk and look away .	well , it 's only the truth . there are horrible things in the world , rose .
no , i 'm awake . what 's the matter ?	buddy , i am wandering in a wilderness , lost . i just feel awful . do you mind if i get in bed with you for a little while ?
i thought i 'd go crazy back there in that room all by myself with nobody to talk to . as a child , i never had no room all to myself , we were awful poor . buddy ... i have got a confession to make .	what is it , rose ?
it 's so terrible i ca n't tell you . oh , buddy , you do n't know how it hurts to have a broken heart , what a terrible feeling it is , and i 've had a broken heart so many times . men , i do n't understand them , i ca n't figure them out and they break my heart , that 's all . i ca n't find mr. right , buddy , i ca n't find him no matter how hard i look , all i find is a whole pile of mr. wrongs . but this is the worst ever because it was n't his fault . it was my fault , oh yes , my fault , i was bad -- oh god , i was bad , you would n't believe how bad i was .	what 'd you do , rose ?
buddy , i was horrible . i ca n't tell you who it was , but do you know what i did ? i sat on his lap and got ahold of him and wiggled and wiggled my ass on him and was worse'n you could know , a child like you . why , i let one of my tits fall out deliberate on purpose and practically smack him in the face with it and i let my dern skirt come up so he could see my drawers ... but to get back serious to what i was sayin ' , it is not only , buddy , the loss of him but my own bad behavior what bothers me so ...	you were pretty bad , huh ?
why , it has just made me ill , buddy . i 'm sick . i do n't want to eat nothin ' , i do n't , and me i got a good appetite , that ai n't nat'ral for me . i 'm ill .	but , rose , what is the cause of it all ?
promise not to tell doll ? -- or nobody ? buddy , it 's your daddy ! i 'm so much in love with him i am out of my mind !	but , rose , how could such a thing as that happen ?
hmmm , it 's soft . it 's awful soft .	what did you expect ?
well , i thought they were more like a cantaloupe .	ha ha ha , that 's some idea , a cantaloupe .
there 's some kind of gristle in it , though .	buddy , quit that , you 're just a child , you 're not supposed to be interested in such things .
actually , i am , though .	you know , that daddy of yours is the funniest man , the things he says , you never know what 's going to come out of his mouth next .
can i put my hand inside your nightgown , rose ?	no , you ca n't . and i 'll tell you this -- he scares me . as kind as he is , he scares me . you ca n't fool around with him , not with that man . and , boy , i sure better not try nothin ' like that with him again , he 'll fire me .
rose , ca n't i see what the nipple on it is like ?	buddy , what 's come over you ? a child like you , askin ' such things .
just for a second . please , rose , what 's the harm ?	buddy , you do n't realize it but what you 're doing is n't nice .
aw , come on , rose , i want to see what the nipple on it is like .	you don ' t need to know that . it 's none of your business .
well , are you satisfied now ? can we just lie and talk , huh ?	hmmph . it has a nipple , all right .
'course it does .	first i could n't feel it , but now i feel it easily , it 's like a little acorn .
all right , that 's enough . you 're just a child and would n't understand it , but that type of thing can stir a girl up . now lie back and we 'll talk .	that was very interesting . thank you , rose .
do n't mention it .	it was softer'n i thought , that was my main impression . you know , if you hit a girl there it would hurt her a lot .
who would want to do such a thing as that ?	well , some fiend might .
you know , buddy , sometimes i ca n't figure you out at all . you can be very nice , but like your mother said there 's an evil streak in you .	there 's an evil streak in everybody , rose .
there ai n't none in your daddy . you know , what happened has just made me love him all the more . i not only love him , i respect him , i admire him .	rose , i have a serious favor to ask you .
most men would n't do what he done . if they can get a girl they go right ahead and get her -- i guess to hell they do , just like a dern rabbit . 'course later they 'll tell her she 's no good when they done the same thing their selves . they 're a bunch of monkeys . i like 'em , but they 're a bunch of monkeys .	rose , since you 're here in bed with me and everything and i 've already touched your titty ...
why , buddy , shut your mouth ! what an awful thing to say , and where did you get any such idea as that , anyhow ?	i 'm curious to see what it 's like . i 'm very curious , rose .
well , now that is just too bad ! curiosity killed the cat .	yeah , but satisfaction brought him back . can i ?
no ! you ought to be ashamed of yourself astin ' such a nasty things a child your age !	ca n't i touch it a little , rose -- not a lot , just a little ?
of course you ca n't ! i 'm ... i 'm shocked at you , buddy , real shocked ! now you be quiet or i 'm going back to my own bed !	please , rose . i 'm curious , that 's all , i have a natural curiosity , it 's only human . you 're my friend , are n't you ? do n't you like me ? i like you , rose , a lot -- in fact , i love you .
well , you 're sweet , but you do n't really love me .	yes , i do . please , rose , be a good sport .
buddy , you 're just a child .	i 'm thirteen . and i have a natural curiosity . it 's only nature , rose , that 's all . now what 's wrong with nature , huh ?
you better quit that .	but rose ...
i must be outta my mind . buddy , quit it .	am i hurting you ?
no . no , you 're not hurting me . but i think you better quit it .	but why , if i 'm not hurting you ?
rose , are you all right ? are you sick or something ?	no . no , i 'm all right . oh , god , what have i done ? i have robbed a cradle and fallen into hell ! i must be crazy , a child like you . oh , god , oh , lord . this is awful , this is terrible , i got ta get outta here !
buddy , you would n't tell nobody , would you ?	do n't worry , rose , i wo n't tell a soul .
i sure hope you do n't . i got ta get outta here , good night .	good night , rose .
i hate to turn on this light , you daddy 's awake downstairs , but i have to take the chance . buddy , please do n't tell on me .	i said i would n't .
rose , they could stick splinters under my fingernails , and i will never say a word ! i will never tell them , because ... i love you !	oh , buddy , you do love me ! i knew you did , knew it all the time ...
well , ill tell you this . i have learned a lesson tonight . i was n't gon na run around , but when i start botherin ' your daddy and worse robbin ' a cradle , i got ta face the facts of life . tomorrow mornin ' , i 'm gon na get myself up and go out .	you 're going to get yourself up and go out ?
here comes daddy .	i have a knack for designing clothes . but i had to buy the shoes and the pocketbook .
did your momma really give you castor oil ?	yeah .
rose , you must know who the fellow is .	well , he might be that man who followed me home from the store the other day . but i do n't know who he is , buddy , i really do n't .
i got an awful toothache .	rose , if you do n't keep your boyfriends away from the house , daddy is going to fire you .
oh , he 's so kind , so gentle inside , and so unhappy with that rich wife who does n't understand him , her being a southerner and everything , and what a bedside manner he has got -- so gentle and kind beneath the professor way he acts !	rose , you are too uncritical of people .
you do n't know the bedside manner that man has got . why , it does me good just to see him sit there all solemn and go pokin ' in his bag like he 's gon na cure me , which he did of course . and even more important he loves me , like a patient i mean , the other day he got tears in his eyes just listenin ' to my heart beat .	he did ?
yeah , he tried to hide it but i saw 'em , and a little bit he says to me , `` you know , you are beautiful . '' now was n't that a nice thing for a doctor to say to a patient , was n't it ? what could cheer a girl up more ?	rose , i have got doubts about that doctor and so does daddy .
he 's got doubts about hisself and that 's the saddest thing of all . would you believe that poor man thinks nobody likes him ?	yeah , i 'd believe it .
well , i like him . i used to be afraid of doctors but not any more . why , he could operate on me any old time and i would n't even be scared .	rose , you are just entirely too uncritical of people .
oh , buddy , they 're gon na cut me all up ! they 're gon na cut my stummick all open , i 'll die !	you wo n't die , rose .
i got ta find out what they 're saying . you lie back and rest , rose , and i 'll give you a report on it .	i do n't want to know ...
hi , buddy . how 's my sweetheart who never told on me when i was bad ?	okay .
makin ' homes for purple martins , huh ? we had 'em on the farm . they 're the prettiest things . that 's what i wish i was , a bird . just fly around catch bugs and have a lot of fun .	what are you going to do , rose ?
i guess i 'll work as a waitress , buddy . i done that before and it got me in worse trouble than you could know , but i ca n't stay here no more . why did you get rid of your rabbits , buddy ?	they 're dumb things . i got tired of them .
did you know when i was a child we had pretty near five hundred rabbits ?	five hundred rabbits ?
yep , we had 'em in orange crates all over . it was daddy 's dream . he was goin ' to get rich raisin ' rabbits . it was what killed daddy . he did n't drown hisself till a long time later after momma and lunette died of typhoid , but it was them rabbits what killed him .	how did the rabbits kill him ?
he thought he could sell 'em , but nobody but country folks eat rabbits , buddy , and they ai n't got no money . we had to eat them dern rabbits our own selves . every dern one , and it took about four years to eat 'em all up .	well , that doctor said you got protein somewhere and i guess he was right .
boy did i get sick of rabbit . but later on after momma died and daddy was n't doin ' nothin ' but drinkin ' , i sure would of been glad for a little rabbit stew . you know , i ought n't to of told you about what daddy done when i was a child . until them rabbits ruined him , he was a real good man , buddy .	what was your mother like ?
maybe it was eating all those rabbits that made you sexy , rose .	buddy , sex do n't mean a thing to me . it ai n't nothin ' but a mosquito bite . i 'll tell you a secret . girls do n't want sex , buddy , girls want love .
neither do i .	oh , waski , you do n't even know what we 're talking about .
yeah , i know .	oh , waski , you do n't know anything .
i do , too !	all right , what do you know ?
he did lie , and ... and ... and mother , yesterday he stole money out of your pocketbook !	quiet , you little muddy-eyed brat , or ill kill you !
of course not !	oh , waski , you do n't even know what we 're talking about .
you were up late last night , brother .	well , a little .
reading dirty comic bocks . and you admitted it ?	well , yeah .
son , was rose in your room last night ?	no . why should rose be in my room ?
i never saw anything like it . how did she pick him up so fast ?	i do n't know .
is that doctor still up there , brother .	yeah , he 's still up there .
what do you think , brother ?	i do n't know . but you better watch him like a hawk , if he comes back again .
see that , son ? now this is a heel , see , and there , that 's the ball of a foot . someone has been walking here .	well , it 's not very plain .
that is because it rained recently , the rain has obscured the evidence . but you could still take plaster casts of these footprints , then match up the plaster casts with whosever shoes they are , and that way you could catch him -- understand ?	but how would you find him ?
well . well , what i mean is , you could prove it was his shoes if you did catch him . but look this , brother , it is even more interesting . look at this mark here , and that mark over there . now would n't you say those marks are the marks of a ladder ?	well , i do n't know . no , i do n't know , daddy , i think the rain has obscured it .
see , son ? the paint is flaked off here , freshly . look at it , brother , there is no question about it . some person or persons unknown have very recently tampered with this ladder .	well ... maybe ...
open that door , damn you !	daddy , what 's the matter ?
i heard you talking . has n't rose come in ?	no , she has n't . i think i hear a car .
the new girl is here .	wonderful . what 's she like , brother ? what is your impression of her ?
your impression is very reassuring , brother . of course she 's had troubles , poor thing , but i sensed that was that the girl was like and i 'm glad to have it reconfirmed .	you mean confirmed , mother . i did n't confirm it before . i would have had to confirm it previously , in order for it to be reconfirmed .
all right , all right . doll and waski are upstairs taking their nap , you go get them and bring them down to the living room . where is the girl ?	in the kitchen drinking all the ice water in glenville . she walked out here , she did n't go by the hotel .
brother , when i have to wake you up at eleven o'clock in the morning you 're either sick or you were up very late last night . and you were n't reading huckleberry finn . i looked and its not in your room . now what were you doing ?	mother , i have to tell the truth . i was n't reading huckleberry finn , i was reading one of those little dirty comic books .
mother , cant you make it calomel instead of castor oil ?	this is for your own good . when you look at negative , destructive things like those little filthy comic books , you are sick . here , take this .
geccch , yehh , guhhhh !	stop gagging like that and putting on a show , and swallow it .
uhhh , gahdam stuff !	what did you say , brother ?
i said ahhh-dam stuff .	no , you did n't say that , brother .
children , children ! be quiet , all of you ! the vibrations in this house are strange today . where 's rose , anyhow ?	she 's getting herself up to go out .
what 'd you say , brother ?	she 's getting herself up to go out . i think she 's coming down the hall now .
heh , what a hypocrite .	i do wish you 'd speak to brother . it 's true he 's been looking at those horrible little books again .
excuse me , got ta go to bathroom .	now i have a plan about rose , an educational plan . she 's getting better and we do n't want any more trouble -- brother , you ought to hear this .
rose is almost as sentimental as mother . if there 's one thing i ca n't stand it 's sentimentality . in chattanooga this man committed an almost perfect murder . he killed his wife with a black widow spider .	oh , shut up , buddy .
daddy says rose is calm as lettuce . do you believe that , doll ?	no .
it 's pitiful . neither one of them know .	i think daddy suspects .
it 's really pitiful . she 's in bad shape .	she 's watching the car again ?
yeah .	i get so irritated with daddy . he 's so dumb sometimes .
there goes mother .	yeah .
let 's go peep from the living room .	okay .
i think she 's gon na kiss him .	at least .
i ca n't see . what are they doing , what 's happening ?	they 're discussing it .
this is my place and you ca n't have it .	ohhh-hh ... what 's happening now ?
he 's trying to get up -- good god , one of her titties is out !	let me see !
now i ca n't see . what are they doing ?	boy ! wow !
wow ! brrrother !	what are they doing ?
buddy , this is amazing , you would n't believe it .	what are they doing , doll ?
he kissed her .	is that all ?
he had his hand on her titty .	let me look . aww-rr ...
she 's putting the titty back .	buddy , that was my place .
buddy , that was pretty snotty of you , pushing me away like that just when it was interesting .	you should n't watch such things , doll .
was n't daddy wonderful ? he wanted to kiss her some more and play with her , but he did n't , because he loves mother and all of us , and he loves rose , too . is n't he wonderful , is n't he great ?	wonderful ? he kissed her and played with her titty , and i do n't see anything so great about that . he was probably afraid mother would come back early and catch him .
no , mother , he 's lying ...	shut up , doll . i 'll cut your guts
chattanooga . i had st. louis , missouri .	buddy , i 'm worried about rose .
so am i .	she has n't got any sense . in some ways , she 's awful dumb .
it is n't that she has n't got any sense , doll . her basic intelligence is probably above average , maybe quite a bit above average .	then why does she act so dumb ?
what is rose going to do ? where can she go ?	they 've been in there the longest kind of time . i ca n't stand it , i got ta find out what 's going on .
what 's happening ?	mother is struggling desperately . in fact she 's fighting like a tiger . but i do n't know , it 's close , it 's mighty close .
buddy ... does rose really ... `` do it '' with all those boys and men ?	doll , do n't ask childish questions .
well , if she 's got any sense at all , she 'll listen to that .	sense does n't mean anything to rose . but i think we 're on safe ground now . daddy chained up the ladder , whoever it is ca n't get in the house .
what 's goin ' on ?	rose says she 's goin ' to have a baby and she sure looks it , but i do n't think so .
a baby ... and she is n't even married .	that 's the least of her troubles . rose had a rare tropic disease and the little tubes in her that babies swim down are all stopped up , she told me all about it .
why is it taking so long ?	here comes daddy .
well , you rascal , where 'd you come from ?	hello , daddy . how are you ?
about as good as can be expected with one foot in the grave . good to see you , son . did you bring any of that yankee whisky with you ?	it is n't yankee whisky , daddy , it 's scotch .
i can use a drink after the plane ride i had .	your wife and children are back in new hampshire in the snow ?
are they polar bears , too ?	good god , the way you live here . this place has n't been dusted since mother died . look at that goddamned refrigerator .
got another twenty years in it , boy . by the way , son , do you recall rose , that pretty blonde girl who came to our house way back in 1935 or 1936 and caused such a damnable commotion .	of course i recall rose . in fact i 've been thinking of no one else for the last hour and a half .
how could that be , son ?	dave wilkie of all people was sitting by me on the plane -- her first husband . it 's funny you would mention rose . did you hear from her ?
what 's all this about rose ? what do you mean , you heard from her in a manner of speaking ?	oh , i heard from her , i got a letter from her , she 's fine . but there is some sad news .
what sad news ? did her cancer come back ?	oh , no , no , she got all over that . rose is fine . let 's sit down , son .
is her husband sick or something ?	no , it 's another thing . i was going to write you about it , but since you were coming down anyway i thought i 'd wait till you got here . what did dave wilkie have to say ?
the pitiful son of a bitch said rose was a nymphomaniac .	um-hmm , and i suppose that incensed you ?
you 're damn right it incensed me , the miserable bastard . he also said the kikes and the niggers have taken over washington . d.c .	yeah , i know , he was up here . it 's pitiful like you say . when he lost rose it ruined the man , it destroyed him totally when he lost rose .
he did n't lose her , he threw her away .	yes , i guess he did . he threw her away and it was the mistake of his life .
you know , i do n't know this town any more . all this traffic , new buildings , prosperity ... where have the years gone , daddy ? where is the little town i knew as a boy ?	at rest in the creative universe with mother , son .
that 's what she would say herself .	a wonderful woman , boy .
it always gives me a funny feeling to come home . dear old southland . gone . it 's all gone , daddy -- -- except you , you 're still here .	not for long , boy . i 've outstayed my welcome already .
it 's funny you would mention rose , i was thinking about her all the way up in the car . or maybe it is n't so funny .	i 'm older than hell , boy . but this yankee whisky is mighty fine , i 'll say that .
all right , daddy . we have our drink , we 're out on the patio , you have prepared me for it . rose 's cancer has come back , has n't it ?	no , son , she is dead .
dead , rose is dead ? you mean ... she died ?	i am afraid so , son . about a week ago . her husband phoned me , she had asked him to call me if anything happened .
but ... but how ? she was young ! rose was n't old !	she was fifty-six , son . of course she did n't look it , nowhere near it . the cancer came back , i 'm afraid i fibbed about that . but it was very quick , son . she was in the hospital only two weeks , and the last week she did n't know anything .
well , you have knocked me for a hell of a loop , old man . a hell of a loop .	i know . you loved her . so did i. it was an awful shock to me , too . an awful shock . rose was so alive it 's hard to believe .
i ca n't believe it , daddy . i know it must be true , but i ca n't believe it .	it 's true , son . the girl with the cornflower eyes is dead , she is no more ,
why rose ? why rose , daddy ?	nobody lives forever , boy . who 'd want to ?
that 's a hell of a thing to say . why , rose ?	now look , boy , get a grip on yourself . rose had a good life . she found her . right , did n't she ? she triumphed over everything , what are you blubbering about ?
the point is you do n't grow up like that on a diet of sorghum and hominy grits . she got protein somewhere , she 's a very strong girl and i think she 'll live ... despite the delay in medical treatment .	that 's all i want to know . lets get out of here before i get the epizootics myself . thank you , doctor , for your discourse , it was fascinating , no doubt .
well , it 's a disaster . i do n't know what to say , doctor , i am floored . how dangerous is the operation ?	any major operation is dangerous . however , as we know from her previous illness , she 's a very strong girl .
well , if it is n't malignant and she can get through the operation all right , it might be better than her really being pregnant . she does n't even know who the father might have been .	oh , it 's definitely better , beyond question . a fatherless child , an ignorant girl with no job , no money , no home . it 's fortunate , a blessing really , and a stroke of good luck for another reason i want to mention to you .
go ahead , doctor , i think i am following you .	first , about the girl 's history . evidently she 's been very promiscuous since early childhood , she has no control over her sexual impulses . furthermore , she is permanently barren , she ca n't have children .
i am ahead of you .	then ... may i speak quite frankly with you , mr. hillyer ?
please do .	i have of course observed the girl in treating her .
of course .	i think we both know her .
it is n't the fourth dimension . to you it 's the fourth dimension , maybe , to me it 's simply the truth .	well , well , well . so miss rosebud has arrived . un-hmm . and you 're all assembled here . yes , indeed . un hmmm .
good morning , sweetheart . beautiful day .	yes , it 's so nice i thought i 'd work outside .
how goes it , darlin ' ?	slow , hon . but at least i can concentrate now that rose is here .
turn up your hearing aid .	what ?
your hearing aid , it 's buzzing at me like a snake .	oh . did you say something ?
i asked you what you think of rosebud , now that she 's been here a while .	honey , she 's perfect . she works all the time and she 's wonderful with the children . and they love her , even brother likes her though he wo n't admit it . i think she 's just perfect .
um-hmm . almost too perfect .	and she 's such a good-hearted thing , there is n't an ounce of harm or malice in her .
well , i 'll admit i do n't see any flies on her yet .	there are no flies on rose , i do n't know what you 're talking about .
well , let 's hope for the best , darlin ' .	hope for the best ? i do n't understand all this skepticism . i thought you liked rose .
i love rosebud , i am wild about rosebud . i just hope she does n't turn out to be a hidden hotcha character , that 's all . we have growing children in the house .	hotcha character . if i had to live with your cynicism , i would n't want to live at all . what you ca n't understand is that the creative forces of the universe are positive , not negative .
all right , darlin ' , do n't go off into the fourth dimension .	i 'm not in the fourth dimension -- -- you are in the fourth dimension , when you allow skepticism and doubt to take control . as blake said , if god had doubt the sun would go out .
forgive my crudity , darlin ' . i do n't understand these deeper things the way you do .	be nice to rose . she 's never had a real home .
i 'll drive you , darlin ' . you 've got no business behind the wheel of an automobile . you do n't think about what you 're doing and you 'll run into a telephone pole .	i think about what i 'm doing all the time , and i 've got as much business behind the wheel of an automobile as anybody . besides , i want you to stay and help rose with the dishes , the poor girl is n't feeling well .
what 's the matter , hon ? is anything wrong ?	no , darlin ' . just that damnable insomnia in reverse . i sleep like a baby for an hour then i 'm wide awake . you go back to sleep .
um-hmm . well , that is the damndest outfit i ever saw in my life . you walk down the street like that and they 'll put you in jail , rose .	why , they wo n't either . she looks pretty . and i wish you would n't pick on the poor girl all the time . do n't listen to him , rose , you look pretty , even beautiful .
lay off of that stuff , son . it upsets your mother .	i 'm serious . we forget he 's just a child . i wish you 'd speak to him .
they 'll put her in jail . the damn little fool might as well be naked .	well , it is a little tight . but it is n't as bad as all that . no one will notice unless they have such thoughts in the first place .
who does n't have such thoughts ? we 'd better get going .	you 're not having lunch ?
just half-a-cup of coffee . i never eat , darlin ' , you know that . not eating and reverse insomnia are my curses . let 's go , rose , you and brother , let 's hit the road .	rose , you and brother wait in the car . i want to speak for a moment lo mr. hillyer .
i wish you would n't pick on rose and tease her like that . of course her clothes are silly , but she 's ignorant , naive , she does n't know any better .	the girl worries me . if she walks down the street like that , an army will be following her .
well , i admit that outfit is n't very modest . but she does n't mean any harm , she just wants to attract , attention .	she will succeed .
i do n't think you understand her . it is n't sex she wants , it 's love she wants and this is the only way she knows how to get it .	that farmer in gadsden was awful eager to get rid of her , and i 'm beginning to see why .
he and his wife both said she had a fine moral character and was wonderful with children .	well , she loves children , all right . she loves everybody .
but that 's a wonderful quality , not a bad quality . have a little patience with her . she 's such a good-hearted little thing and tries so hard .	you are the one who 's good-hearted . as for rose , let 's hope for the best .
be kind to her . she loves you so much . in a perfectly proper way , of course .	yes , of course .
well , she 's back .	what time is it ?
quarter of twelve .	is she all right ?
why should n't she go out and have boyfriends ?	no reason at all , darlin ' .
well , i wish you 'd stop criticizing and picking on her .	forgive my crudity , darlin ' . all i 'm saying is that a girl who would wear clothes like that is going to get in trouble sooner or later .
well , time will tell , wo n't it ?	yes , darlin ' , time will tell .
that sulky boy was here again this afternoon . i was almost scared , he would n't go away .	rose , my patience is wearing thin . first a scruffy man who runs like a deer and now a sulky boy who wont go away . this is getting to be a regular monkey and dog show .
well , it is n't rose 's fault boys and men like her . you cant blame her for that , hon .	rose , i realize you do n't know this boy , but if you know anybody who does know him , if you have even a faint clue as to who he might be , then convey to him that he had better stay away from my house and stop scaring my wife ... and i do n't mean maybe .
oh , shut up , rose . shut your mouth and quit crying !	i will not sit here and listen to you be brutal to this poor girl .
i am not being brutal to her !	you certainly are ! she has an awful toothache , look at her jaw , it 's all swollen .
-- i am not responsible for her epizootics and i did not bring about her epizootics . now listen to me . when i have to get up in the middle of the night and defend my home with a shotgun against a couple of damned scoundrels fistfighting in the bushes --	scoundrels ? they were n't scoundrels , they were just boys .
boys ? you say to me boys ?	yes ! yes , i say that to you , they were boys ! boy friends of rose , chat 's what they were , and why should n't she have boy friends ? do you want her to be unnatural ? do n't you think she 's human the same way you are yourself ? it 's the south , that 's what it is , the south with its horrible traditions , of slavery and crime and the oppression of women , who are just as good as men and just as human !
now darlin ' , what has the south got to do with this ?	and when i try to talk to you seriously , when i try to explain to you the unlimited creative power of life , how beautiful it would be if we gave up this hopeless struggle and simply loved each other from our hearts , what do you do -- you mock me !
now you listen to me , rose --	just a moment ! you are not going to fire this girl for an innocent thing like having boy friends , not while there is breath in my body !
i do n't intend to fire her , darlin ' .	it is n't her fault if she 's popular ... what ?
i said i do n't intend to fire her . i just want to ask her to keep her boy friends away from my home and hearth , that 's all .	well , that 's very reasonable . howe i hate to bring it up , but she 's got an awful toothache , we 've got to carry her to the dentist .
i 'm sorry , darlin ' , i hate it as much as you do .	well , she does seem to cause a lot of trouble , i admit . but she does n't mean any harm and it 'll break the children 's hearts , they all love her .
it 's because of the children she 's got to go . i do n't want to be holier-than-thou , but the girl does n't have the same outlook we do . morals do n't mean a thing to her , not a thing , and we ca n't have a girl like that in this house .	who is to say our morals are better than hers ? but maybe you 're right . she could ... influence dolly ...
that is exactly what i 'm afraid of . the girl has got to go , darlin ' .	but morals come from the heart , not from rigid rules and empty laws . and in her heart rose has never hurt anyone and she never would . therefore , she 's not immoral . not really .
now look , darlin ' , this is no time to go off into the fourth dimension .	but what i said is the simple truth . and now i see something else , i see more deeply into it ...
how could rose really be a bad influence on dolly ? she has a loving nature , you ought to want someone like that around your children . why do you think those boys and men like her ?	well , i have a pretty good idea .
if you mean sex , you could n't be more wrong . rose likes those boys and men , she has love in her heart , and that is what they want . it 's the most rare and beautiful thing in life and that is why they follow her .	they follow her because she 's a -- -- no , i wo n't say that .
what she does n't understand is that her behavior is disturbing to other people . she 's young , she 's got to learn to restrain the life force that 's in her . its creative , but in her case it 's too creative .	darlin ' , rose has got to go !
excuse me , sir , are you calling my wife a liar ?	honey , please ...
i ca n't stand that polecat . they ought to hang him .	you do n't like him because he 's a yankee . he 's a brilliant doctor .
rosebud looked pretty pitiful in that bed . i hope she 'll be all right , but i still think we ought to fire her .	i do n't see how you can even think of it now .
honey , dr. martinson is n't a rascal , he 's one of the finest physicians in glenville . he studied at johns hopkins university .	i do n't care where the polecat studied .
she 's like a different person . being so sick made a big impression on her . i really think she 's learned a lesson .	um-hmm . come with me , brother . i want to show you something .
she has n't actually done anything ...	just a moment , dear . we ca n't have it , rose . can you behave yourself -- or not ? that is the question , to behave or not to behave , to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous chastity and keep your skirt down or to hoist it in the light of the moon and make whoopee -- that is the coil shuffling question . if you ca n't behave i am going to fire you and i say it in front of you and mrs. hillyer and i mean it . i point my rigid finger right at your nose , rose , and i stare unwaveringly into your big blue eyes and i tell you ... this is a final warning . do you hear me ?
it has been three weeks since i `` fired '' her . is there no way to get rid of this girl ? are we stuck with her for life ?	she ca n't get a job , it 's a depression . and we ca n't just throw her out on the street .
she does look a little peaky .	no , she does n't , she 's fine , fine . she 's perfectly healthy , do n't give her ideas .
her plan is obvious , plain as day . she 's going on a hunger strike . the question is , how do we foil her ?	she 's just nervous and worried . and you would be , too , if you had no job and no place to go .
honey , rose was born on a farm and has terrible memories of farm life . now i do n't think --	just a minute , rose , you do n't understand . this is n't a dirt farm like the one you were born on , it 's nice . a neighbor of cousin hop 's , i talked to him on the phone , a fine man ... it 's not a farm , damn it , it 's a beautiful dairy establishment ! stop crying , rose ! do you hear me ? stop crying , it 's ideal !
i do n't know how you can call it ideal -- do n't you know what the word `` farm '' means to her ?	i do n't give a hoot in hell 's hollow what it means to her ! she ca n't stay in this house forever ! i fired her , damn it !
it sounds like a farm to me . calling it a dairy establishment , that 's just trickery and flummery .	trickery and flummery or not , she 's going there tomorrow on the bus ! it 's settled ! and i must say we 've been more than fair to you , rose , it 's pretty selfish and mean hearted of you to sit there and cry like that !
this is a total catastrastroke . as of this moment i am stumped , i admit , i am stumped and treed both , the hound dogs have me surrounded .	poor thing , do n't cry , rose . i know you feel awful , but do n't cry , honey , nobody 's perfect . who 's the father , dear ?
you 're not going to get anywhere with that line of questioning . the problem is , what are we going to do ?	that 's why i 'm asking her who the father is . it 's the most vital question of all . who 's the father , dear ?
she already told you , she does n't know .	but she must know ... unless ... unless ... rose , was there more than one person ?
ah , ha ! hold the phone ! no forwarding address , huh ? in the shock of this brilliant move , i forgot something .	what did you forget ?
honey !	she does n't have to take her panties off , we can see her stomach with 'em on . all she has to do is pull up her dress and let us see her belly .
i 'd say about three months . are you satisfied ?	i am poleaxed and in a non compos mentis condition . i wash my hands or the whole thing .
this conversation is making me a little sick .	honey , that 's no way to talk to the doctor , he 's merely doing his job , dear .
reluctantly , i do . it would be a blessing to her and everyone else . the girl is oversexed and i say -- spay her !	over ... my ... dead ... body !
i thought i knew you . i thought i knew you better , i thought in your heart you were a good and kind man . well , i ca n't believe what i 've just heard in this room . a defenseless girl depending on you for protection , and you propose to mutilate and destroy her . how could you listen even for a moment to that sadistic man ?	well , now , darlin ' ... give me a chance to defend myself .
i ca n't believe you really meant it , if i did i 'd want to die . you are n't a male monster , that man is but you are n't . look me in the eye and tell me , do you really want to take rose 's womanhood away from her when it 's all she has got ?	well , i ... i had n't thought about it that much . i was thinking ... well , it 's an idea , the girl is oversexed , and ...
rose is n't oversexed , that 's ridiculous . if you 're going to talk nonsense , i do n't want to talk to you at all . rose is exactly the same as the rest of us , except more so .	well , i know , more so . that 's why i was thinking ... maybe she 'd be better off .
how is she ?	fine .
it 's twenty after one .	i do n't understand it . even in the wild days she was never as late as this .
why , that looks like dave wilkie ,	who ?
well , thank god we are rid of her at last . and the best thing of all is that she 's happy . the little nut is happy , she found mr. right in the nick of time !	well , yes , she 's happy . of course dave does n't have her life force , not at all . there is n't much furniture in his house , just a table and one or two chairs , whereas rose has furniture coming out of the windows .
honey , he is mr. right .	yes , i think so . he adores her , it 's almost pitiful the way he worships her . i just hope she is n't too much for him .
yes , sir .	all right . now as head of this household i have a couple of remarks to make . it is my dear wife 's belief , which i accept although i do not totally grasp it , that to hire a person to do household work is a criminal practice . therefore , you are here not as a servant , you are here as a friend , as a guest and hopefully as a member of this family . you will eat your meals with us , you will share life itself with us -- in love and harmony , dear rosebud , in love and harmony . do you understand me ?
rosebaby blossom , these are the most delicious candied yams i ever ate ! why , they just melt in my mouth . and this fried chicken is fit for a king . how do you do it , peachbird ? what is the secret of your art , plum blossom , huh ?	oh , i do n't know , i ... i ...
rosebird baby , you are the light of my life , darlin ' . how did we ever get by without you ?	i ... i 'll get the grits .
ahh-hem ! now , rose , get off my lap . what are you doing , girl ? are you crazy ?	yes , crazy about you ! kiss me , mr. hillyer !
why , i 'm not going to kiss you , you crazy girl . now i 'm telling you again , get off my lap . come on , rose , get up . now you get up , i say , and stop this !	no , no ! you do n't understand , i love you ! it 's real love and i ca n't help it ! please kiss me , mr. hillyer , i love you , i love you so much ...
all right , all right . now calm down , rose , the children will hear you . calm down , let 's talk ... about this thing , let 's discuss it .	do n't make me ... me ... me ... get up !
goddamn you , girl ! you 've made me make a fool out of myself , damn your hide , but let me tell you i am standing at the pass of thermopylae and i wo n't budge ! the very idea , my own home with children in the house , to say nothing of my wife -- oh-h , you had better believe i am standing at thermopylae , you little nut , you had better believe it ! what are you , crazy ? a man is supposed to be a fool like this , but a woman is supposed to have some control and sense ! are you a nitwit ? what 's the matter with you ?	oh-h , i 'm sorry . i 'm sorry , mr. hillyer ... i just ... could n't help myself . i 'm sorry ...
rose , rose , rose , you poor miserable little child , do n't you know i love you ? do i have to put my hand on your body or kiss your pretty lips to prove it ? you are beautiful to me , rose , i 've loved you since you first came here , darlin ' . and do n't you know mrs. hillyer loves you , too , that she 's already taken you into her heart , and that that woman 's heart is as wide as the blue sky itself and as deep as the stars ?	oh , i know . she 's so sweet , she 's been so good to me ...
rose , what are you doing up ?	nothin ' , just goin ' to the bathroom .
is anything wrong ?	no , sir .
nothin ' . i got myself up , that 's all .	got yourself up ?
you 're so sweet .	if you 've got time before you go `` out , '' get me a half-a-cup of coffee , rose . not a whole cup , a half-a-cup .
why , sure , always got time to get you a half-a-cup , and one of these days i 'm gon na get you a whole cup and see what happens .	um-hmmuhh . i never drink a whole cup , my nerves ca n't stand the caffeine . ehh-hh , lord awful insomnia in reverse last night . lay there and sweated blood for hours .
that 's a pretty stylish skirt , rose . the only thing i do n't understand is how did you ever get it on .	well , it has buttons .
how can the buttons stand the pressure ?	there are more on the other side .
what have you got in your hair , girl ?	my rose . it 's kind of like a motto . people will say , there comes rose with her rose .
you were up late last night , too , rose .	yes , sir . i had to go to the bathroom .
where do you want me to let you out , rose ?	oh , anywhere downtown .
you do n't know where you 're going ?	oh , i 'll just mosey around here and there .
is this ill right ?	it 'll do just fine . bye-bye , see you later .
well , rose , my sleep was a little disturbed last night , and so was mrs. hillyer 's , and so was the children 's . how about you ? was your sleep disturbed , too ?	yes , mr. hillyer , it was . i ... i heard strange voices in the night .
strange voices , rose ?	yes , sir .
ohhh-hh , ohhh ...	oh , shut up , rose , eat your cornflakes !
darlin ' , i 'll take a taxi to the hotel . you and brother can handle the girl 's epizootics . i 'll just say one more thing . rose , i told you you had a friend in mrs. hillyer , did n't i , that she would fight for you like a tiger ?	yes , sir .
all right , thanks to her , and thanks to this case of epizootics , you are getting another chance . but do n't try my patience again . we have growing children in this house . do you understand me ?	yes , sir .
good morning , rose . and how do you feel today ?	wonderful . except i can touch the place back there with my tongue , i would n't even know i had that tooth pulled .
well , i know it , i just got the bill for it .	boy , for four or five days there i did n't think i 'd live . but i 'm my old self again !
umm . well . yes . but no more strange voices in the night , rose .	oh , no , sir .
i got an awful bad cold .	that 's all you 've got to say , you 've got a bad cold ?
i did n't mean to bite him . he was hitting horton with a blackjack in the meanest way and ... and i bit him accidental .	i have to go back to the hotel . i 'm on duty at the desk and who knows a quest might arrive . i will see you at suppertime , rose .
i did n't mean to bite him , i really did n't .	i will see you at suppertime , rose .
i mean a human investment , rose , we care about you , you matter to us . but we have innocent and unformed children in this house and the monkey and dog show has got to stop . do you hear me ?	yes , sir .
there ai n't nobody here , mr. hillyer ! honest , there ai n't !	where is he ? where have you got him hid ? ah , ha !
and who , rose , may i ask , is that ?	well , it 's billy .
and what , may i ask , was billy doing here ?	well , mr. hillyer , billy 's very poor , he do n't have no money and there was n't no place else to go .
well , it was a silly question .	he 's a nice boy , you 'd like him . he wants to be a fireman .
ye gods and little fishes , a fireman . put on some clothes , rose , you 're naked as a jay bird . when you 're dressed , come on downstairs . i 'm afraid your friend billy is injured , where are his clothes ?	under the mattress . i hid 'em so you would n't be mad . he wants to marry me , he loves me . i ca n't marry him , he 's too young and has n't got no job , but he loves me ... now you would n't hurt him , would you ?
mr. hillyer , i know it was bad and i had n't ought to of done it . but i 'm only a human girl and i ... i ai n't always perfect . i promise i wo n't let him in the house no more , i promise . wo n't you and mrs. hillyer forgive me ?	rose , darlin ' , you break my heart . but i am only a human man myself of the father variety . rose , pack your bag , baby , as of this moment you are hired , mired and fired .
well , rose , going out to look for a job today ?	what 's the use , there ai n't none .
god forbid . you 're not sick , rose , forget it . do n't get any notions in your head , you 're not sick .	yes , sir .
well , i have got news ! i called long distance and spoke to cousin hop and you 'll be glad to know , rose , i have found you a job !	tennessee ?
yes , tennessee , a lovely state !	well . what kinda job is it ?
ahh-hh , you 'll like it . it 's a fine , outdoor-type job .	you mean a farm ?
i 'm not cryin ' because of me , i 'm cryin ' because of somebody else .	what ?
what baby ? what baby ? what baby are you speaking about ?	mine .
your baby ?	yes , mine . i 'm going to have one .
yes , i am .	no , you 're not .
yes , mr. hillyer , i am .	all right , tell us , rose , what makes you think you 're pregnant ?
i have n't had my period for three months and my stomach is getting big .	i do n't believe it .
it 's so , mr. hillyer .	all right , damn it . we 've seen you with your clothes off around here , stand up and pull up your dress and let 's take a look !
you 're looking very chipper this morning , rose . sow do you feel ?	perfect , wonderful , good as i ever felt ! except for a big old scar on my stummick , i would n't even know i been in the hospital .
well , we know you were there . the bill that hospital sent was absolutely horrendous .	well , i 'll pay you that back sometime , mr. hillyer .
rose ... i hate to be mean , but ... oh , nevermind , forget it .	what was it , mr. hillyer ?
excuse me ... your voice is familiar and i 'm sure i know you from somewhere ...	awww-rr , buddy , come on , you know me !
well , i ... i ... ah-h , let 's see ...	it 's dave wilkie ! i 'm dave wilkie , do n't you remember me ?
well , i am in the construction business , buddy , and without braggin ' i have done real good at it . there are those who would n't have expected that out of me . right now i 'm buildin ' a giant motel unit near alexandria , outside washington , d.c. not fi-nance , i 'm on the construction side .	well , that 's interesting , dave . i always liked washington , it 's a pretty town .
ha ha , course you make a lot more . what 's that you got there , buddy ?	galley proof .
galley what ?	page proof of a book i 'm working on .
how about that . well , you always were a screwball .	oh , yeah ?
i do n't mean that the way it sounds . imagine it , a book . and i used to know you personal way back when . tell me something , buddy , how do you dream up all that stuff ?	well , actually , we have a little black boy named her -- -t who lives in the garage . he does it for me .
heh heh heh heh , same old buddy , always jokin ' around . almost as much of a joker as your daddy . i saw your daddy a coupla years ago , i was up in glenville lookin ' at a motel site . i guess that 's where you 're headed , huh , to see him ?	that 's right , dave , i 'm headed for glenville on a whisperin ' jet .
took your time gettin ' here .	she has other things to do , dave .
tell me about that job in alexandria , dave , the big motel you 're building .	near alexandria . it is n't in alexandria , it is outside it .
i see . outside it .	that 's correct -- outside it , not in it . as for the job , well , the jewboy suppliers give me a lot of grief and we use a pile of niggers to haul and tote and they ai n't worth a sorry-ass damn . but i can build anything , buddy . give me the plans and i can build a goddamn staircase to the moon . it 's a fact , i can build anything ... ... but she never believed that . oh , hell , no , she never believed in me .
um-m , well ...	doubted my ability all along , the little bitch . i never remarried , buddy , you know that , do n't you ?
well , no , i did n't actually .	she 's te reason -- cured me of women once and for all . oh , i got rid of her , buddy , i did n't waste no time kickin ' that bitch out . hell , she was screwin ' everybody in savannah . i caught her in a motel with this long tall son of a bitch and boy did i beat the everlastin ' piss out of him !
she did n't marry him , though , later she married another guy and went to winston-salem . it did n't last that girl could n't have no lastin ' marriage , she left him and married another dumb sucker and went out west . little bitch left him , too , and you know what she 's married to right now ? a kike . that 's right , some kind of kike horse doctor named schapiro out in seattle , who 's got the nerve to have the same first name i got . would n't you know it , rose would wind up married to a goddamn kike ? she was always out of her friggin ' head and i 'll tell you why . buddy , she was sick in her mind and between her legs , too . she was a nymphomaniac .	dave , you are as full of shit as a christmas turkey and you know it . now if you want to start a fight on this plane and get yourself in jail , go right ahead . but i am telling you , you are full of shit right up to your eyeballs .
i do n't want to start no fight with you , buddy . why do you say i 'm full of shit ?	dave schapiro is no horse doctor and rose has been a good wife to him for a long time . to call her a nymphomaniac is the most stupid thing i ever heard in my life .
you loved her , did n't you . well , so did i. you 'll have to admit she had four husbands .	yeah , it took her a while to grow up and find mr. right , but she did it . she found him .
she used to call me mr. right . remember that , buddy ?	yeah , i remember it .
well , got to get a plane to savannah . great running into you , buddy . give my best to your daddy .	yeah , i 'll do that , dave .
ah-h , if you happen to run into rose sometime ... do me a favor , give her a message for me , will you ?	dave , i have n't seen rose for years .
you might see her . she writes your daddy , and she and that doctor came to see him , did n't they ? i wish you 'd tell her something ... i never could write letters .	what do you want me to tell her , dave ?
i do n't like that , either , it 's worse than waski . i want to be called fran .	daddy would n't hear that . now the redhaired boy you see sitting there , of course you have met him , he is my oldest son and my most brilliant child . all children have great creative powers , but i do n't want to rattle on about my children , they say i brag too much about them , especially about brother . am i boring you , rose ?
yes , dear , what is it ?	mother , buddy says rose got in his bed last night and he fiddled with her and she snorted and had a fit -- and he says i would too if i was grown-up . is it true , mother -- would i sweat and snort and froth at the mouth and have a horrible fit like he says ?
daddy , buddy was up late last night reading little dirty comic books . mother gave him a dose of castor oil and he cursed it , he took the lords name in vain , then claimed he had n't said it . he lied , daddy .	you must n't be a tattletale , dear . you must n't be delilah-ish and jezebel-ish toward your brother , dear .
what 's the matter with him ?	i do n't know . i think he 's cryin ' !
well , mrs. hillyer , the girl is strong as an ox and that is what is keeping her alive . but not many people walk away from double pneumonia , madam , not many .	she looks terrible , just awful .
of course she does and i must say i 'm puzzled by your delay in getting her to the hospital . i should think ordinary powers of observation would have suggested to you that she was seriously ill .	she hid it from us , doctor . she 's afraid of the hospital .
afraid of the hospital ?	deathly afraid of it . her people were poor tenant farmers and she does n't know anything about doctors or medicine or hospitals .
a tenant farm ? are you trying to tell me that girl is a product of the hookworm and pellagra belt ?	well , her people were very poor . she says she was often hungry as a child , and i 'm sure the food she ate was pretty awful , not a balanced diet at all .
it 's simply that i find it incredible , mr. hillyer . aside from the girl 's illness at the moment , she is very strong , a very healthy specimen of a young human female -- and a comely one , too . she must have gotten protein somewhere as a young child , if only sporadically .	it is kind of amazing . the dentist says she has perfect teeth , there is n't a cavity in her mouth .
yes , thank you , doctor .	i beg your pardon , epi-zoo-tics ? do you mean `` epi-zoo-ot-tics , '' an animal epidemic ?
oh , good evening , doctor . rose is a lot better , i just gave her her supper . she 's almost all well now .	let me be the judge of that , madam .
i 'm not surprised you thought she was pregnant . an ovarian cyst can look very much like pregnancy . but it was pure wishful thinking on her part . the girl can never have children , she had gonorrhea at fifteen and it was untreated .	gonorrhea ?
do n't worry , madam , she ca n't infect your dear little kiddies . she long ago fully recovered , but the disease did irreparable damage . the girl is permanently barren .	well , that 's pathetic . poor rose , what a life she has had .
we make our own lives , madam . as for malignancy , i do n't think so , it 's very unlikely . i probably should n't have even mentioned that possibility to her .	no , you should n't have , it was needlessly cruel . she thinks she has cancer and is going to die .
i 'm sorry the truth nauseates you , mrs. hillyer , because before you leave there 's a bit more of it i 'd like to put to you . this operation provides a therapeutic opportunity that i feel is quite important in regard to this particular girl , who suffers not only from an ovarian cyst but from a certain psychoneurotic condition as well .	what do you mean , what kind of gobbledygook talk is that ?
yes , go on .	i am thinking particularly of the other ovary . as a rule i do n't believe in removing it . the woman 's hormonal system is profoundly disturbed , she is subject to possibly serious depression , she loses many of her secondary sexual characteristics for example , her breasts might shrink and become flabby , facial hair might appear along with a coarsening of the features , and of course her sexual drive is greatly diminished , especially in a girl or young woman . for these reasons i am opposed to removing the other ovary , as a rule . do you follow me ?
what are you talking about ? i do n't understand all this mumbo jumbo and the funny looks on your faces .	mrs. hillyer , this girl is sick in more ways than one . she is an extreme psychoneurotic with uncontrollable sexual impulses . it would be a mercy to spare her the suffering she causes herself and others . therefore i recommend as a therapeutic measure the removal of her second ovary . it is ethically and medically the only proper decision in this case and i suspect your husband agrees with me .
are you human beings or are you some kind of male monsters ? is there no limit to which you wo n't go to keep your illusions about yourselves ?	illusions , madam ?
i will not cry like a woman . if i 'm upset it 's because of what my husband said , not because of you . you ca n't make me cry like a woman , a woman has got just as much intelligence and self-control as a man . and you get this in your head . if you hurt that girl , i 'll hire lawyers and sue you for malpractice for every penny you have got , i 'll do my level best to ruin you . do you understand me ?	yes , i understand you , but you have misunderstood me completely .
i understand you perfectly . you leave that girl alone , you wretched man , or you will be sorry .	actually of course i wo n't operate , i do n't do major surgery . dr. hardy will operate and of course he 'll be guided by your wishes in this respect .
well , she finally let me look in her mouth . is it true she 's never been to a dentist ?	she was raised on a poor dirt farm . i 'm sure she 's never seen a dentist or hardly even a doctor .
well , she has one mouth in ten thousand , i do n't see teeth like that once in ten years . her trouble is an impacted wisdom tooth , but there is n't a cavity in her head , not a single one . she has perfect teeth .	but the wisdom tooth will have to be pulled ?
yes , and it 's very bad . it probably should be done at the hospital under general anesthesia .	that would scare her to death . she 's terrified of hospitals . to her , a hospital is where you go to die .
rose , this is waski . his real name is warren but we call him waski . he does n't like it much and i suppose someday we 'll have to stop calling him that .	you can stop it right now .
when he was baby we called him `` wa wa , '' a baby name , you know . you will find him a very good boy . his brother can be bad and so can his sister , but waski is a very good boy . and as you can see he 's beautiful .	oh , mother , cut it out .
mother ... is rose going to die ?	no , waski , she wo n't die , because we are praying for her .
oh , no , ma'am .	well , it 's rather interesting about brother , actually . i realized the remarkable thing he had when he was six weeks old . he looked at me and understood me , he knew exactly who i was . i know it sounds crazy but it 's true . he 's very remarkable , he was born for the ministry and could move millions , but he does n't know that yet . i have to warn you about him , he can be very dangerous , there is an evil streak in him , a streak of pure sheer meanness . but at heart brother is saintly and that is why he was born for the ministry even if he does n't know it .
what are you studying now , mrs. hillyer ?	more history , rose .
are you going to get your degree soon ?	well , i am working on my thesis .
it must be wonderful to be so smart . i do n't see how you do it , reading all those books , learning all that stuff .	rose , you work too hard . why do n't you go sit down somewhere and drink a co-cola ?
really , why do n't you go sit down somewhere ?	i like to work . i do n't mind work . it 's the least i can do after all you and mr. hillyer have done for me . you 're so sweet . there never was nobody like you .
well , you run on now .	yes , ma'am .
rose , you 're in an awful dither tonight . what 's the matter with you , honey , are you sick or something ?	no , ma'am , i 'm just fine .
well , i think it 's charming , rose . but do n't you think ... ah , the skirt is a little tight ?	oh , no , that 's the style . it 's meant to be clinging .
yes , ma'am .	doll , you and waski run on , too .
rose , that scruffy-looking man is out in the yard again .	mrs. hillyer , i do n't know who he is , i really do n't .
i do n't think we ought to discuss this in front of the children .	oh ... oh ... oh ! i think ... maybe ... one of 'em ... was foster ... but i do n't hardly know him !
i do n't want to go to the dentist .	be quiet , rose .
poor thing . does the ice help , rose ?	ohh-hh , a little . oh-h , i ai n't never been to no dentist before . he 's gon na kill me , i just know it .
i 'm not goin ' in there , i do n't like the looks of it !	rose , sit down in that chair and be quiet ! we 're trying to help you , you silly creature , sit in that chair !
never again , never again ...	i know it was bad , honey . i 'm sorry ...
no more dentists , no more dentists ...	it 'll get better now .
rose has learned her lesson , have n't you , rose ?	yes , ma'am .
rose , you 're very sick . you 're burning up . rose , can you hear me ? rose ?	what ? wha-at ? mrs. hillyer ?
you see , rose ? now that 's the kind of dress you ought to wear .	yeah , it 's kinda nice .
you look very pretty in it , rose . really , you do .	well , you 're real sweet to make it for me . there never was nobody like you . and you do n't need to worry , i ai n't goin ' out no more .
well , there 's no reason you should n't go out , rose ... in moderation .	i do n't want to . when i was lyin ' there in that hospital bed at death 's door i says to myself , i ai n't goin ' out no more . if i ever get outta this , i 'll just stay home .
rose , you do n't look well and you have n't eaten a bit of breakfast .	i 'm not hungry . i ca n't eat nothin ' , i have n't been able to eat since i got fired . i think maybe i 'm sick .
well , i ... i ... i do n't know ... maybe it was ... but no , you ca n't be sure about a thing like that . it was n't billy , i did n't know him .	i know it 's embarrassing ... but who were you exposed to , dear ? rose well , now , mrs. hillyer , i ... ah-h , that 's kinda hard to say .
oh-h , mrs. hillyer , i ... i ca n't think . i ... i 'm not really sure .	rose , really , you should n't act like that .
rose , you do n't have to .	i do n't mind .
do n't worry , honey , you 'll find something .	i was offered that job as a waitress .
you 'll never guess what happened ! i have met mr. right ! i been with him all day and he loves me , i know he does , he loves me and he 's going to marry met be 's practi'cly ast me already !	well ... well , that 's wonderful , rose .
i ... i can explain ...	i 'm looking at this poster , and i 'm thinkin ' , i do n't remember seeing films like this when i was in school .
i was going to tell him .	what were you gon na say ? exactly how did you think he was gon na make the leap from dating a sweet , innocent school teacher to an ass-fucking porn star ?
let me tell him . let him decide .	you 're not gon na see him again .
what ... what makes you think you can order me around ? !	maybe i 'm not making myself clear . you 're probably the first girl billy-boy 's ever fallen in love with , and i know for sure you 're the first he 's slept with . so , how 's he gon na feel ... ... when he finds out that the only first he is for you is the first guy who did n't have to pull out at the last second to get his close-up ?
has n't he got enough problems , or did n't you notice that 's not cream soda on his breath ?	... okay ... you made your point .
indivisible and inseparable .	incestuous .
what eve and i would n't give to meet up with you on the business end of a daisy chain .	put up your kickstand , freak . start talking , or we 're out the door .
how much ?	i figure , for this information , the usual payment ... times ten .
you think it 's that good ?	i 'll tell you what ... i think it 's all you 've got .
you get nothing and like it . and if we 're not blissfully happy with what you tell us , we arrest you just for the fun of it .	okay , man , okay . i 'm with you . i ... i heard how the shit 's arriving ... it 's coming in a lincoln .
and ... ?	what and ? that 's what i got .
a lincoln ? what lincoln ? lincoln continental ? lincoln mark five ... six ... ?	now you know what to watch for ...
have i ever steered you wrong ?	cuff'em . let 's see what these two love birds say once they 're sitting in separate cages .
take her down to the car , and for christ 's sake be careful this time . last suspect he took in , butter-fingers dropped her down the stairs . what a mess . why is it we do n't appreciate our arms and legs till we 've lost the use of them ?	hey , listen ... i 'll give you something else , kittle . anything . remember ... remember that corpse washed up on huntington beach ? it was never identified ...
who cares ?	alright , wait ... there 's a dentist in brentwood peddling morphine ...
come on , do n't you screw with her , please ! you ... you got to want this : armored car job . caltrust bank . they took two million in cash ...	read my lips : zimmermann or nothing .
we 'll take the caltrust heist , but if it 's no good , we will hunt you down , and billy-boy will pull out your spine and he will beat you to death with it .	fair enough .
this is private property . this is breaking and entering !	just entering . we 'll get to the breaking in a minute .
you 're zimmermann 's calculator , archie . all the blood money you had to move around to make this deal , you got to know something . maybe they told you , maybe you overheard things you were n't supposed to hear ...	i 'm telling you , you 're barking up the wrong tree .
well , i 'm running out of trees , so look me in the eye like a man and tell me you do n't know ! convince me !	i do n't know . fuck off !
it 's six o'clock . time 's runaing out . decide .	if i tell you , how do i know you wo n't just club me and take it back ?
three hundred kilos of white lady hidden inside a giant bust of abraham lincoln . a parade float .	what ... ?
kittle ...	where you been hiding , grease-fist ? we 've been looking for you .
what do you want ? i 'm clean . i been clean a long time .	really ? is that a fact ... ?
oh , you fuckers ! you fucking fuckers ! what ? what do you want ?	word is , while the vice cops on the east coast were standing around playing pocket pool , 300 kilos of heroin got smuggled into new york city . and , right now it 's making a cross-country journey to hollywood , u.s.a .
hey now ... what the fuck ... ?	again .
know what he 's doing , benny ? he 's trying to jog your memory .	i do n't know what you 're talking about , man . even if i did , i 'm not so crazy i 'm gon na cross zimmermann .
last time billy-boy did this , the guy 's neck broke ... ... just like that . sad in a way . why is it we do n't truly appreciate our arms and legs till we 've lost the use of them ?	alright ! alright ... put me down ...
it 's bone dry out there . everybody 's hurting . the stuff floating around 's been cut so many times it 's like powdered sugar , but zimnermann 's gon na fix it .	i need the `` when '' and the `` where . ''
how 's your precious little school-marm today ?	she 's fine , as if you cared .
tell me something ... what 's a school teacher doing having you meet for breakfast in one of the filthiest parts of downtown skank-ville ? i mean , this is not the place for fine dining , unless looking at prostitutes stimulates your appetite .	filthy kids go to kindergarten too . what are you saying , anyhow ?
nothing , i guess . just an observation . she 's really something special . you 're a lucky fella .	lay off once , would you ?
what 'd i say ?	it 's the way you say it , like there 's something more too it .
she 's right . if you two are doing the horizontal polka , the last thing you want is a thirty-five pound bundle-of-joy stumbling around , knocking over furniture and calling you `` daddy . ''	jeez ... it 's too early in the morning for this . leave off . here 's your paper .
you should n't litter .	thank you , concerned citizen .
give a hoot . do n't pollute .	i 'll give you a fucking hoot if you do n't shut up back there .
just a little , you know ... bicentennial memento . nothing special .	whoa , thanks , man . these are cool . they 'll be collector 's items .
escort everyone 's favorite she-male over here nice and peaceful-like . let 's not have another incident like at the laundromat . i 'll never forget the look on that poor woman 's face .	that was n't my fault .
i ... i ca n't find my seatbelt .	what do you want me to do about it ?
sons of bitches !	we catch 'em , i wan na be first to hurt 'em . promise me i get to go first .
i can work this .	no you ca n't .
make a hole , billy-boy .	i 'd rather you guys did n't do this again .
this is too fast . this is < u > way < /u > too fast !	relax .
we should slow down .	hands off the suit , monkey-boy . close your eyes if you 're scared .
jiminy christmas .	i can not even begin to imagine how much that must have hurt .
i say , fuck 'em . let 's go .	well ... we should n't rush into this , right ? let 's talk about it .
what are you , henry friggin ' kissinger all the sudden ?	i 'm just saying ...
you 're just saying nothing ! tonight is the night .	yeah , but if we do n't sit , they 'll take our badges .
all i got is being a cop . what do i do if i 'm not that ?	you big , fat sonofabitch , if it were n't for me , you 'd still be sitting in the file room where i found you . and you ... nena ... you 've still got needle scars from where i pulled you out of . you of all people ...
we shoulda been there to back you up . we shoulda !	stop blaming yourself .
ah , jeez , billy ... careful !	i got him .
`` a.d . ''	who 's that ? zimmermann 's money-man ?
where you gon na be ?	it 's personal . we 'll hook up at billy-boy 's pad in an hour . see ya then .
no offices are gon na be open today .	lots of these pencil-pushers work out of their homes . it 's a tax dodge .
okay , we got ... one , two ... three ... two caddies and poe 's mustang .	could be worse . i do n't know how , but i 'm sure it could .
remember those two uniform cops who been giving us such a hard time ... ?	yeah .
the ones you got in that fist-fight with a couple a weeks ago ... ?	yeah .
that 's them trying to kill us .	well , they sure know how to hold a grudge .
look , kittle ... pull over and let me out . i 'll be fine ... okay ? how 'bout that ... ? oh , lord almighty , listen to me ... i do n't want to die ! ! lem me out of this coffin ! !	clench your teeth .
wh ... what ... ? !	clench your teeth so when we land you do n't accidentally bite off your tongue .
that 's sick .	welcome to beverly hills . wife-swapping capital of the world .
what 's the plan ?	beats me . you got a suggestion , feel free to shout it out , genius .
when you planning to cut back on that ?	what ?
the booze .	i do n't know . i could quit now if i wanted , i just do n't want to .
i do n't know what the problem is . plenty of great men throughout history got their bravery out of a bottle	name one .
dean martin .	entertainers do n't count .
who 's been giving you history lessons ? your bartender ?	okay , seriously . what about napoleon , huh ?
what about him ?	you 've never heard of napoleon brandy , mister smarty-pants ? how do you think it got its name ?
they ... they shot me .	they shot us all , kid .
what day is it ?	same day as before . i think .
where we going ?	we 're gon na rain on zimmermann 's parade .
how you doing back there ?	feeling great .
gimmie a butt .	you do n't smoke .
happy independence day .	yeah . happy fourth of july .
why do i always have to sit in back ?	it 's just the way things are , kiddo .
well , i would like to sit in front today .	it 's not gon na happen .
you been wearing rubbers , billy-boy ?	wha ... ?
birth control 's important .	what ... what kinda thing is that to say ?
you know , the more weight back there , the faster the car goes .	bullshit .
you never heard of physics , einstein ? the laws of physics . the more ballast we keep closer to the rear tires ...	i 'm back here , are n't i ? so , you do n't have to make up a buncha lies to make me feel good about it .
what 's mine say ?	`` leo . the stages of the moon are in alignment , so now is a perfect time for a vigorous regimen of self improvement . wash yourself more carefully each morning , stop using pies and cakes as your primary source of nourishment , and quit tucking your shirttails inside your underwear . ''
it does n't say that .	no , but it should .
hey ...	forgive me for not ooing cartwheels over commemorative salt and pepper shakers
that 's him alright .	it 's go time , billy-b .
smooth move , hot-shot .	what was i supposed to do ?
laugh it up . you 'll cry later .	you 'll cry like a great big , blubbering baby .
what the ... ? ! what was that for ?	follow me .
where we going ?	we have to find kittle .
okay . but , what changed our mind ?	just keep an eye out till i get this rig up and running .
let 's go ! fuck everything ! god damn sons of bitching mother humpers ... i 'm gon na rip'em all brand new assholes ... !	hey ... hey ! cool down , jumbo !
i ca n't believe we 're stealing .	we 're not stealing . we 're borrowing .
no , we 're stealing .	this is the police lock-up . we 're police . how can we steal from ourselves ?
who said it wa 's me , hub ? anyway ... he fell off a ladder . it was n't really my fault .	well , i got something.. pop-sweet 's accounting ledger for the disco-strip . all the money transactions . look ... someone 's putting their initials beside the weekly totals . like they 're acknowledging a deposit .
you live like a pig .	ca n't you say something nice once ?
bad news is , word 's spreading like wildfire that we do n't have badges , and nobody wants to end up getting splattered like butch cassidy either .	if we do n't catch a break soon , we 're gon na be left standing with our dicks in our hands .
whoa , whoa ... it 's gon na be alright .	... where ... where 's a jerk like me ever gon na find another girl to love him ... huh ? ...
do n't talk like that . there 's plenty of women around for jerks like you .	you 're lying ...
you plan on shooting that gun or just hugging it ?	i 'm waiting till the time 's right .
what about jack daniels ? was n't he a decorated general in the civil war ?	no .
general jim beam , then .	nope .
billy , i love you i really do ... but i 've got to tell you , every day , in every way , you give new meaning to the word `` stupidity . ''	what can i say to that ... except , i love you too , you mean-spirited bitch .
you could start over again with cash like that .	go wherever you want . live how you want .
feels like there 's a bullet still in my chest .	there probably is .
he tried to kill us .	we 've got the tape to prove it .
hey now , look ! let 's all get on the same page here . this shipment is do or die for zimmermann 's syndicate ; all or nothing . if we stop the drugs , we do n't even have to catch him red-handed . he 's ruined cause his pushers go broke with nothing to sell . on the other hand , if we fuck this up , it means more zombies crawling the gutters than ever and a morgue that does n't have a single empty drawer . more old ladies getting mugged and molested by junk-hungry needle-freaks , and all the while zimmermann 's sitting back and laughing his head off .	there 'll be other chances .
i 'm gon na put a great big , ear-to-fucking-ear smile on your face . how 'bout that ?	where have you been ?
our resignations .	you going rogue on me ?
maybe .	what happened , kittle ? we used to be friends . you used to know how the game was played .
you mean taking bribes , and skimming busts and letting hoods walk ? you mean not being able to sleep at night after shaking down some honest joe ?	there was a time when you did things the right way , till you hooked up with that fat-assed-boozehound and the soul-sister .
it 's noon straight up . effective immediately , you three work desk jobs till midnight .	you ca n't be serious .
ca n't i ?	we 've been chasing this deal six months , and now you 're gon na chuck it out the window ?
he went to pick up lunch .	well , shake a leg . get these files downstairs ... and , quit listening to your fucking voodoo music .
and , what ... what am i forgetting ? oh , yes ... the transvestite junkie whose bullet riddled body came blasting through the front doors of the precinct house !	well , sir ...
no . do n't open your mouth ! you < u > honestly < /u > think you can explain this to my satisfaction ?	i ... i think i can ... clarify ...
do n't bother . this behavior 's gone on too long . you 're suspended .	what ?
do n't you condescend to tell me how or why to honor independence day , and do n't tell me i 'm overreacting when i 'm trying to bust the guy responsible for half the filthy junk coming into this city !	you 're about an inch away from insubordination !
well ... seeing how you just suspended me , what 's to stop me from calling you a crazy bastard , you old fart ?	till the last firework fizzles out tonight , detective , you sit a desk . and , after that , i 'll decide if you keep your shield .
what can we do for you , officers ? what new , mindless harassments have you planned this morning ?	just wanted to make you aware ... before today 's over , we 'll be standing on top of your mountain of horse and pissing down on you .
could n't have said it better myself .	you bust some small-time pimps , whores and dime-bag junkies , like the world 's a better place because you 're in it . and for what , kittle ... two hundred and fifty dollars a week ? tell me , how does anyone get so self-rightious when they can barely afford to pay their rent ?
just 'cause you belong to some fancy-pants club , does n't make you any less a murderer .	murderer ? really ?
thanks , but we do n't recognize `` brunch '' as an actual meal .	i insist . what will it be ? boston tea party clam chowder , or maybe the chicken red , white and cordon bleu ? no ... there 's a special on the menu , today only ... ... < u > roasted < /u > < u > pig < /u > .
your poison 's not gon na make it into the veins of any kids this time .	wave that flag , hero . keep dreaming those dreams .
you fuckers ... damn you ! why ? ! why me ! ? why the obsession with me ?	it 's our job .
pardon me ... my mistake . taking your thoughts in hand , huh ... ?	whoops ... do n't mind me . go ahead and finish up .
pure horse .	you are such a disappointment , benny .
arriving tonight	going into zimmermann 's pipeline .
why do you bother with that mumbo-jumbo crap ? some fruitcake 's writing it between bong hits , making it up as he goes , and you 're actually taking the time to read it .	yeah , non-believer ? here 's yours ... `` scorpio , october 24 to november 22 : jupiter is in conflict with saturn , so proceed with caution ... ''
look out ! jupiter and saturn 'll get you every fucking time .	`` today you have a rare opportunity to make a big difference in your chosen field . by your able leadership and with great conviction and strength of character , you will come up a winner . ''
yeah ... great .	you know ... you could say thank you .
you 're the one with the star-spangled hard-on , not me .	what are you , communist ? at least numb-nuts here has the courtesy to pretend he likes them .
i just think you should show some respect . i mean , call me old fashioned , but 200 years ago when ben franklin and those guys signed the constitution and declaration of independence , they did that so we could all share in the freedom ...	first of all , the constitution was n't writtem till 1787 ...
you know what i mean .	second of all , the declaration of independence was all for liberty and equality , but it did n't do anything about slavery , did it ?
yeah , well ... nobody 's perfect . they could n't go doing everything at once .	all i 'm saying is , your little bicentennial mementos would be more accurate if there were no holes in the pepper shaker so the pepper could n't get out .
alright ?	absolutely .
we got him .	slow down .
`` go , go , go ! '' `` slow down . '' make up your mind .	do n't crowd him .
hold your horses , sweetpea . we need butch cassidy alive , remember ?	shit . you 're right .
if they crash , maybe he 'll run . you can shoot him in the leg or something .	let 's hope .
i 'm gon na get beside him .	no you 're not .
i 'm gon na get beside . nena , you 're gon na shoot out his tires .	no , we are < u > not < /u > going to do that .
you ... suck ! you almost got us all killed !	you think this is so easy ?
ca n't be worse than you .	oh yeah ?
that 's right , white bread . give it up . right now .	okay , okay ... hold on . do n't go getting your panties in a knot ...
get closer ! do n't lose him !	i kinda already figured that , but keep those helpful hints coming .
you put your bumper just behind his left tire and then accelerate ... make him spin out ...	is there nothing in this world you enjoy more than the sound of your own voice ?
what ... ? not you too ?	he 's right . we hit the bricks , we walk back triple-fucked .
i ca n't believe i 'm hearing this ,	i worked my ass off for my badge , kittle , it 's the only thing that makes me different from every other slob out there .
that 's not true .	i know it is , even if you do n't .
yeah , my arms healed up real good , and that 's how i wan na keep 'em . that 's what i 'm trying to tell you .	guys ... all we 've got is each other . do n't we know that by now ?
you need a doctor .	nothing 's broke . keep sewing . and quit pacing , you big ox . you 're making me skittish .
any preferences ?	whatever goes bang .
let 's get this thing done .	all for one ...
alright , flesh-peddler , let 's see empty hands !	out here . on your knees .
you get him ?	dead .
if it is , that 's pretty high up on the totem pole . what do you think ?	gimmie a minute .
alright ... how about you two hit the strip and start knocking some heads together ? find out who `` a.d. '' is . i got a quick errand to run .	sounds good .
been waiting long ?	just got here .
how 'd we do ?	a.d. is a c.p.a .
come again ... ?	archibald dobbs ; certified public accountant . but , that 's all we got .
get his attention .	your wish is my command .
hey-ho ... ! maybe we 're not alone in this thing after all .	who is that ... ?
what the hell 's his problem ?	you mean , besides the warrant out on us for blowing up our commanding officer ?
you 're ... you 're not doing what i think you 're doing ... ?	seatbelts fastened , please .
you suck at lying , archie .	see ... now that we know you know , the hard part 's done for us .
we 're screwed .	i 'm well aware of that .
this much powder you do n't throw in the trunk with a blanket over it . it 's got to be smuggled .	there 's not even enough places to stash it in a car .
no more counting the big money for someone else .	beholden to none .
think zimmermann 's watching ?	who the fuck knows ? we 'll find out soon enough .
you john-wilkes-booth-ed him .	billy ! billy !
why the beach ?	so there 's nobody around to get killed in the explosion .
oh , yeah ... the explosion .	know what i love about dynamite ?
do tell .	when you bunch it together , it 's exponentially more powerful . two sticks have the power of four sticks . four sticks have the power of sixteen , and so on .
i do n't think so .	well , that 's what i heard , and that 's what i choose to believe .
the gang 's all here !	keep 'em busy .
you see that ?	yeah .
you always did have style .	it 's one of a kind .
this shit was ming .	that 's the problem with expensive tastes ... the more you got , the more you got to lose .
where 's your pet gorilla and the female uncle tom ?	they 're ... around .
yeah ? so , what do you want to ask today that i ca n't answer ? i 'm a busy man .	the way zimmermann takes such good care of you and this drug-peddling `` escort service '' of yours , i figure you got the scoop on the pharmaceuticals arriving tonight .
admiral , we 're in position . all fighters accounted for .	proceed with the countdown . all groups assume attack coordinates .
all craft , prepare to jump to hyperspace on my mark .	all right . stand by .
we saw it . all craft prepare to retreat .	you wo n't get another chance at this , admiral .
we have no choice , general calrissian . our cruisers ca n't repel firepower of that magnitude .	han will have that shield down . we 've got to give him more time .
at that close range , we wo n't last long against those star destroyers .	we 'll last longer then we will against that death star ... and we might just take a few of them with us .
the shield is down ! commence attack on thedeath star 's main reactor .	we 're on our way . red group , gold group , all fighters follow me . told you they 'd do it !
i ca n't do it , artoo . i ca n't go on alone .	yoda will always be with you .
you told me vader betrayed and murdered my father .	you father was seduced by the dark side of the force . he ceased to be anakin skywalker and became darth vader . when that happened , the good man who was your father was destroyed . so what i have told you was true ... from a certain point of view .
there 's still good in him .	i also thought he could be turned back to the good side . it could n't be done . he is more machine now than man . twisted and evil .
i ca n't do it , ben .	you can not escape your destiny .
i tried to stop him once . i could n't do it .	vader humbled you when first you met him , luke ... but that experience was part of your training . it taught you , among other things , the value of patience . had you not been so impatient to defeat vader then , you could have finished your training here with yoda . you would have been prepared .
to be a jedi , luke , you must confront and then go beyond the dark side - the side your father could n't get past . impatience is the easiest door - for you , like your father . only , your father was seduced by what he found on the other side of the door , and you have held firm . you 're no longer so reckless now , luke . you are strong and patient . and now , you must face darth vader again !	i ca n't kill my own father .
then the emperor has already won . you were our only hope .	yoda spoke of another .
the other he spoke of is your twin sister .	but i have no sister .
hmm . to protect you both from the emperor , you were hidden from your father when you were born . the emperor knew , as i did , if anakin were to have any offspring , they would be a threat to him . that is the reason why your sister remains safely anonymous .	leia ! leia 's my sister .
but you ca n't let her get involved now , ben . vader will destroy her .	she has n't been trained in the ways of the jedi the way you have , luke ... but the force is strong with her , as it is with all of your family . there is no avoiding the battle . you must face and destroy vader !
shhh . you have hibernation sickness .	i ca n't see .
your eyesight will return in time .	where am i ?
jabba 's palace .	who are you ?
the death star will be completed on schedule .	you have done well , lord vader . and now i sense you wish to continue your search for young skywalker .
yes , my master .	patience , my friend . in time he will seek you out . and when he does , you must bring him before me . he has grown strong . only together can we turn him to the dark side of the force .
as you wish .	everything is proceeding as i have foreseen .
what is thy bidding , my master ?	send the fleet to the far side of endor . there it will stay until called for .
what of the reports of the rebel fleet massing near sullust ?	it is of no concern . soon the rebellion will be crushed and young skywalker will be one of us ! your work here is finished , my friend . go out to the command ship and await my orders .
i told you to remain on the command ship .	a small rebel force has penetrated the shield and landed on endor .
i have felt him , my master .	strange , that i have not . i wonder if your feelings on this matter are clear , lord vader .
they are clear , my master .	then you must go to the sanctuary moon and wait for them .
oh , no , my young jedi . you will find that it is you who are mistaken ... about a great many things .	his lightsaber .
han !	luke !
are you all right ?	fine . together again , huh ?
would n't miss it .	how are we doing ?
the same as always .	that bad , huh ? where 's leia ?
i think my eyes are getting better . instead of a big dark blur , i see a big light blur .	there 's nothing to see . i used to live here , you know .
you 're gon na die here , you know . convenient .	just stick close to chewie and lando . i 've taken care of everything .
why do n't you leave that crate and come with us ?	i have a promise i have to keep first ... to an old friend .
luke .	hi , han ... chewie .
you got her warmed ?	yeah , she 's comin ' up .
right . chewie , let 's see what this piece of junk can do . ready , everybody ?	all set .
vader 's on that ship .	now do n't get jittery , luke . there are a lot of command ships . keep your distance though , chewie , but do n't look like you 're trying to keep your distance .
i do n't know . fly casual .	i 'm endangering the mission . i should n't have come .
chewie and i will take care of this . you stay here .	quietly , there might be more of them out there .
i thought she was with you .	we got separated .
take the squad ahead . we 'll meet at the shield generator at 0300 .	come on , artoo . we 'll need your scanners .
nice work . great , chewie ! great ! always thinking with your stomach .	will you take it easy ? let 's just figure out a way to get out of this thing . han , can you reach my lightsaber ?
hey !	han , do n't . it 'll be all right .
somehow , i got the feeling that did n't help us very much .	threepio , tell them if they do n't do as you wish , you 'll become angry and use your magic .
someone who loves you .	leia !
i do n't know . all i can see is a lot of blowing sand !	that 's all any of us can see .
hey , are you awake ?	yeah , i just got a funny feeling . like i 'm not gon na see her again .
now we find out if that code is worth the price we paid .	it 'll work . it 'll work .
shall we try and go around ?	it 'll take time . this whole party 'll be for nothing if they see us .
what 's going on ?	i do n't know .
i ...	ahhh ...
i 'm sorry .	hold me .
the main entrance to the control bunker 's on the far side of that landing platform . this is n't gon na be easy .	hey , do n't worry . chewie and me got into a lot of places more heavily guarded than this .
han ! hurry ! the fleet will be here any moment .	charges ! come on , come on !
the code 's changed . we need artoo !	here 's the terminal .
i 'm sure luke was n't on that thing when it blew .	he was n't . i can feel it .
yes .	all right . i understand . fine . when he comes back , i wo n't get in the way .
han ! chewie ?	lando !
lando , grab it !	lower it !
chewie ! chewie , give me the gun . do n't move , lando .	no , wait ! i thought you were blind !
it 's all right . trust me . do n't move .	all right ! a little higher ! just a little higher !
guess i owe you some thanks , too , lando .	figured if i left you frozen like that you 'd just give me bad luck the rest of my life , so i might as well get you unfrozen sooner or later .
well , look at you , a general , huh ?	oh , well , someone must have told them about my little maneuver at the battle of taanab .
look . i want you to take her . i mean it . take her . you need all the help you can get . she 's the fastest ship in the fleet .	all right , old buddy . you know , i know what she means to you . i 'll take good care of her . she-she wo n't get a scratch . all right ?
good luck .	you , too .
oh , dear . his high exaltedness , the great jabba the hutt , has decreed that you are to be terminated immediately .	good , i hate long waits .
in his belly , you will find a new definition of pain and suffering , as you are slowly digested over a thousand years .	on second thought , let 's pass on that , huh ?
here we go again .	all right , hang on .
what are you telling them ?	hello , i think ... i could be mistaken . they 're using a very primitive dialect . but i do believe they think i am some sort of god .
well , why do n't you use your divine influence and get us out of this ?	i beg your pardon , general solo , but that just would n't be proper .
proper ? !	it 's against my programming to impersonate a deity .
what did he say ?	i 'm rather embarrassed , general solo , but it appears you are to be the main course at a banquet in my honor .
we 're coming !	come on ! come on !
my goodness ! artoo , why did you have to be so brave ?	well , i suppose i could hotwire this thing .
oh , princess leia , are you all right ?	let 's see .
lord vader , this is an unexpected pleasure . we 're honored by your presence .	you may dispense with the pleasantries , commander . i 'm here to put you back on schedule .
i assure you , lord vader , my men are working as fast as they can .	perhaps i can find new ways to motivate them .
i tell you , this station will be operational as planned .	the emperor does not share your optimistic appraisal of the situation .
but he asks the impossible . i need more men .	then perhaps you can tell him when he arrives .
that is correct , commander . and he is most displeased with your apparent lack of progress .	we shall double our efforts .
all wings report in .	red leader standing by .
good shot , red two .	now ... come on , han , old buddy . do n't let me down .
i 'm going in .	here goes nothing .
now lock onto the strongest power source . it should be the power generator .	form up . and stay alert . we could run out of space real fast .
there it is !	all right , wedge . go for the power regulator on the north tower .
ugh !	ohhh , i ca n't bear to watch .
oh !	your royal highness .
what 's he saying ?	he says there 's a secret entrance on the other side of the ridge .
oh ! oh , my . uh , princess leia !	quiet .
i 'm afraid our furry companion has gone and done something rather rash .	oh , no .
over there ! two more of them !	i see them . wait , leia !
leia ... do you remember your mother ? your real mother ?	just a little bit . she died when i was very young .
what do you remember ?	just ... images , really . feelings .
tell me .	she was very beautiful . kind , but ... sad . why are you asking me all this ?
i have no memory of my mother . i never knew her .	luke , tell me . what 's troubling you ?
he 's my father .	your father ?
luke , do n't talk that way . you have a power i -- i do n't understand and could never have .	you 're wrong , leia . you have that power too . in time you 'll learn to use it as i have . the force is strong in my family . my father has it ... i have it ... and ... my sister has it .
yes . it 's you leia .	i know . somehow ... i 've always known .
then you know why i have to face him .	no ! luke , run away , far away . if he can feel your presence , then leave this place . i wish i could go with you .
no , you do n't . you 've always been strong .	but , why must you confront him ?
the emperor has been expecting you .	i know , father .
come with me .	obi-wan once thought as you do .
you do n't know the power of the dark side . i must obey my master .	i will not turn ... and you 'll be forced to kill me .
if that is your destiny .	search your feelings , father . you ca n't do this . i feel the conflict within you . let go of your hate .
obi-wan has taught you well .	i will not fight you , father .
your thoughts betray you , father . i feel the good in you ... the conflict .	there is no conflict .
you could n't bring yourself to kill me before , and i do n't believe you 'll destroy me now .	you underestimate the power of the dark side . if you will not fight , then you will meet your destiny .
you can not hide forever , luke .	i will not fight you .
sister ! so ... you have a twin sister . your feelings have now betrayed her , too . obi-wan was wise to hide her from me . now his failure is complete . if you will not turn to the dark side , then perhaps she will .	never-r-r !
master yoda , you ca n't die .	strong am i with the force ... but not that strong ! twilight is upon me and soon night must fall . that is the way of things ... the way of the force .
but i need your help . i 've come back to complete the training .	no more training do you require . already know you that which you need .
yoda , i must know .	your father he is .
told you , did he ?	yes .
unexpected this is , and unfortunate ...	unfortunate that i know the truth ?
well , i 'm sorry .	remember , a jedi 's strength flows from the force . but beware . anger , fear , aggression . the dark side are they . once you start down the dark path , forever will it dominate your destiny .
ah , good . new acquisitions . you are a protocol droid , are you not ?	i am see-threepio , human-cy ...
yes or no will do .	oh . well , yes .
how many languages do you speak ?	i am fluent in over six million forms of communication , and can readily ...
splendid ! we have been without an interpreter since our master got angry with our last protocol droid and disintegrated him .	disintegrated ?
do you have any tattoos brad .	certainly not !
you !	i 'm afraid so , brad . but was n't it nice ?
why you - what have you done with janet ?	nothing . why do you think i should ?
you tricked me . i would n't have - i 've never - never .	i know , but it was n't all bad was it ? i think you found it quite pleasurable . oh so soft . so sensual .
ahhh - no - stop - i mean janet . janet .	shush . janet 's probably asleep by now . do you want her to see you like this ?
like this . like how ? it 's your fault - you 're to blame . i thought it was the real thing .	oh come on , brad , admit it . it was enjoyable , was n't it ? there 's no crime in giving yourself over to pleasure .
you promise you wo n't tell ?	on my mother 's grave .
i see . so this was n't simply a chance meeting . you came here with a purpose .	i told you , my car broke down .
i was telling the truth .	i know what you told me , brad . but this dr everett scott . his name is not unknown to me .
he was a science teacher at denton high .	and now he works for your government , does n't he , brad ? he 's attached to the bureau of investigation of that which you call u.f.o 's . is n't he , brad ?
he might be . i do n't know .	hmmmm . he 'll be in the zen room .
janet !	rocky !
it 's as if we were glued to the spot .	you are - so quake with fear , you tiny fools .
the future is ours so let 's plan it .	janet .
so please do n't tell me to can it .	janet .
janet .	made me give you the eye and then panic ,
yes .	everyone knows betty 's a wonderful little cook .
yes .	and ralph himself will be in line for promotion in a year or so .
yes brad .	i 've got something to say .
uh huh .	i really loved the skilful way you beat the other girls to the bride 's bouquet .
oh janet	for you .
oh brad , i 'm mad .	dammit , janet .
gosh . that 's the third motorcyclist that 's passed us . they certainly take their lives in their hands . what with the weather and all .	yes , janet . life 's pretty cheap to that type .
i think we took the wrong fork a few miles back .	oh dear ! but then where did the motorcyclists come from ?
what was that bang ?	we must have a blow-out .
you 'd better sit here and keep warm while i go for help .	but where will you go ? we 're in the middle of nowhere .
i 'm coming with you .	there 's no point both of us getting wet .
oh , brad . let 's go back . i 'm cold and i 'm frightened .	just a moment , janet . they may have a telephone .
yes , the rain has been very heavy .	yes .
oh brad , i 'm frightened . what kind of place is this ?	oh , it 's probably some kind of hunting lodge for rich weirdos .
oh ... .say something .	say ! do any of you guys know the madison ?
brad , please lets get out of here .	for god 's sake keep a grip on yourself janet .
but it seems so unhealthy here .	it 's just a..a party janet .
well i want to leave .	we ca n't go anywhere until i get to a phone .
then ask the butler - or someone .	let 's wait awhile janet . we do n't want to interfere with their celebrations .
this is n't the junior chamber of commerce brad .	they 're probably foreigners with ways different from our own . - they may do some more folk dancing .
brad - i 'm cold , i 'm wet , and plain scared .	i 'm here , there 's nothing to worry about .
right !	we 'll just say where we are then go back to the car we do n't want to be any worry .
oh brad .	it 's alright janet , we 'll play along for now and pull out the aces when the time is right .
i 'm brad majors and this is my fiancee , janet vice .	weiss .
brad ...	it 's alright janet .
oh brad - mmmm - oh yes , my darling - what if ...	it 's alright janet . everything 's going to be alright .
oh , i hope so my darling . but let me switch on the light .	no , do n't do that .
maybe we could try it this way .	janet ! oh ! yes it 's alright . janet . everything 's going to be alright .
i 'm engaged to brad just the same as betty monroe was to ralph hapschatt . but frank 's kisses overwhelmed me with an ecstacy i 've never dreamt of before . hot , burning kisses .	and that 's all the time that it takes for a heart to turn to stone the sweeter the wine the harder to make the break you hear something about someone you 'd thought you 'd known .
i could see brad 's face before me and my mind screamed no ! but my lips were hungry - too hungry .	so baby do n't cry like there 's no tomorrow after the night there 's a brand new day . and there 'll be no pain and no more sorrow . so wash your face and phone my place it 'll be o.k .
i wanted to be loved completely . my body throbbed excitedly . oh brad , brad my darling , how could i have done this to you ?	and that 's all the time that it takes for a heart to beat again . so give me a sign that a lover makes you look around the one you 've found is back again .
hello .	uh - oh - hi ! my name is brad majors . and this is my fiancee , janet weiss . i - ah - wondered if you could help us . our car has broken down about two miles up the road . do you have a phone we might use ?
great scott - scotty - dr everett scott .	you know this earth - this person .
good god .	yes .
great heavens , that 's a laser .	yes , dr scott . a laser capable of emitting a beam of pure anti-matter .
you did right .	a decision had to be made .
you 're ok by me .	dr scott i 'm sorry about your nephew .
yes , well perhaps it was for the best .	you must leave now dr scott while it 's still possible . we are about to beam the entire house back to the planet of transexual in the galaxy of transylvania . go now .
well . i do n't like men with ... er , with too many , muscles .	i did n't make him for you
you beast , you monster , what have you done with brad ?	nothing . why , do you think i should ?
you tricked me - i would n't have - i 've never - never	i know . but it was n't all bad was it ? in fact , i think you found it quite pleasurable . mmmmm so soft , so sensual .
ssssh . brad 's probably asleep by now . do you want him to see you like this ?	like this - like how ? it 's your fault . you 're to blame . i was saving myself .
promise you wo n't tell brad .	cross my heart and hope to die .
what a guy	makes you cry
what guy	makes you cry
`` sweet transvestite ''	from transexual transylvania .
`` transylvania ''	so come up to the lab .
on the day i went away .	goodbye
was all i had to say	now i
want to come again and stay	oh my , my ,
feeling	like i 'm outside in the rain
wheeling	free to try and find a game
dealing	cards for sorrow , cards for pain .
and left from my dreaming was a feeling of un-nameable dread .	that ai n't no crime
oh , no no , no no .	sha la la la that ai n't no crime .
no no no , no no .	sha la la la that ai n't no crime - that ai n't no crime .
sha la la la that ai n't no crime .	oh no no no no .
sha la la la that ai n't no crime .	no no no no .
sha la la la that ai n't no crime . that ai n't no crime .	sha la la la that ai n't no crime .
no no no no .	sha la la la that ai n't no crime .
no no no no .	sha la la la that ai n't no crime - that ai n't no crime .
i think you had better both come inside .	you 're too kind .
are you - giving a party ?	no . you 've arrived on a rather special night . it 's one of the master 's affairs .
the master is not yet married . nor do i think he ever will be . we are simply his servants .	oh .
who 's eddie ?	the delivery boy .
creature of the night .	creature of the night .
i thought you liked them . they liked you .	they did n't like me . they never liked me .
our noble mission is almost completed my most beautiful sister , soon we will return to the moon-drenched shores of our `` androgenous '' planet .	ah - sweet transexual - land of night - to sing and dance once more to your dark refrains . to take that step to the right ...
but it 's the pelvic thrust that really drives you insane .	and our world will do the time warp again .
... how 's the turtle food this week ?	... fine .
me , i 'm kinda aggravated .	... i 'm sorry .
i smack 'em hard on the shell an ' they get ... what ?	... i do n't know .
hey , how 's my buddy doin ' ? -- nice dog -- well , i 'll see ya later .	... goodnight , rocky .
it 's thanksgiving .	to you , to me it 's thursday .
looks quiet , y'know .	i think it 's closed .
... are n't you skating ?	ai n't skated since i was fifteen -- that 's when i started fightin ' -- got ta watch the ankles . yeah , fightin ' use to be tops with me , but no more . all i wanted to prove was i were n't no bum -- that i had the stuff to make a good pro .
but you never had a chance to prove yourself .	absolutely .
i just dislocated my finger .	ohh !
y'know how i got started in the fight racket ?	by accident ?
what 's funny ?	my mother told me just the opposite . she said , 'you were n't born with much of a body so you 'd better develop your brain . '
some people are very shy by nature .	... i suppose .
i would say you 're very shy by nature .	... i suppose .
some people think bein ' shy is a disease , but it do n't bother me .	it does n't bother me either .
then why did i bother bringin ' it up ? 'cause i 'm dumb , that 's why ... y'know , i think we make a real sharp coupla coconuts -- i 'm dumb an ' you 're shy .	... it is just hard for me to understand why anybody wants to be a fighter .
ya got ta be a little soft to wan na be a pug ... it 's a racket where ya ' almost guaranteed to end up a bum .	i do n't think you 're a bum .
... i 'm at least half a bum . yeah , fightin ' is a crazy racket . the roughest part is the mornin ' after .	morning after ?
after a rough fight , ya ' nothin ' but a large wound . sometimes i feel like callin ' a taxi to drive me from my bed to the bathroom ... ya ' eyes hurt , ya ' ears hurt , ya ' hair even hurts ... but the thing i 'm proud of is i been in over sixty fights an ' never had a busted nose -- bent an ' twisted an ' bitten but never broke ... that 's rare .	why do you do it if it hurts so bad ?

damn .	i suppose we could cancel the fight indefinitely if you are set on fighting green .
you best find me another ranked contender an ' i mean in a flash , man !	i contacted ernie roman 's manager , he 's fighting in france the same week .
then gim me buddy shaw -- he 's ranked fifth .	shaw 's fighting in south america -- why not postpone the bout until july fourth ?
shape , nothin ' -- they 're afraid . they know everybody in the world 's gon na see this fight an ' none of them got ta prayer of beating me so they 're makin ' excuses so they do n't have to be the chump that 's gon na be whipped in front of the whole civilized world ! !	apollo , i 'm sure there 's a way to salvage this .
now here 's what 's goin ' down . listen , 'cause i 'm gon na say this but one time . on january first , the first day of the bicentennial i 'm gon na fight me a local poor underdog , dig ? a snow-white underdog . an ' i 'm gon na put his face on this poster with me , hear ? an ' i 'll tell you why , 'cause i 'm sentimental -- an ' all the people in the country all sentimental , man , an ' they 'd like nothin ' better than me , apollo creed , to let some unknown get a shot at the greatest title in the world on this country 's biggest birthday . now that 's the way i see it an ' that 's the way i want it ! !	... it 's very american .
how 'bout this billy snow ?	fouls .
joe zack is a good prospect -- exciting boy .	... still do n't feel no heat .
exactly what are you looking for , apollo ?	... this man .
'the italian stallion ' -- he 's my man .	rocky balboa -- his record 's poor --
how was the flight , champ ?	very high an ' very fast .
apollo , how would you rate this last british challenger , henry wilcoxson ?	he was big , an ' very nasty so i destroyed him in a hurry -- now i 'm gettin ' ready for mac lee green next month .
you 're referring to the much publicized bicentennial fight ?	that 's right -- it 's gon na be the greatest sportin ' event in this country 's history -- a gala occurrence !
still to be held in philadelphia ?	the bicentennial heavyweight championship of the world is gon na be held in the only place it can be held -- philadelphia ! -- the nation 's cradle -- january first -- the first major event of our two hundredth year .

hey , whatta ya doin ' here -- we 're closed ... yo , we 're closed !	are ya closed to the general public or to just everybody .
hey , the rink is empty 'cause we 're closed -- ya ai n't allowed in here so do me a favor an ' not stay here .	wait here , got ta smooth this guy out .
yo , pal , what 's with you -- the place ai n't operatin ' .	listen , i got ta problem . this girl ai n't feelin ' well , y'know -- the doctor says she should exercise , y'know once in awhile an ' ice skatin ' is the best thing --
this a con ?	look at her , ya can see she ai n't feelin ' good -- needs a few minutes exercise --
few minutes ?	... ten minutes .
ten minutes for ten dollars .	... yeah , give 'er the blades .
nine minutes !	hey , i ai n't cryin ' ... i still fight . kinda do it like a hobby . see i 'm a natural southpaw an ' most pugs wo n't fight a southpaw 'cause we mess up their timin ' an ' look awkward -- southpaw means lefthanded ... but i guess in the long run things probably worked out for the best , right ?
seven minutes !	it ai n't your fault -- i originally done it in the baby crenshaw fight . that 's me fightin ' big baby crenshaw -- big baby was the size of an airplane an ' i broke my hands on his head -- i lost , but it 's a nice picture , do n't ya think ?
six !	how 'bout some cokes ?
cost ya a buck .	this guy is beautiful -- get the cokes .

that 's ten bucks .	i must be goin ' deaf 'cause i thought ya said , 'ten cents . '
... how 'bout for the cokes ?	charge it .
we would like to welcome our viewing audience to the grand world championship bicentennial heavyweight fight -- the first major event of the bicentennial year ... a point of interest is that the fight is being beamed to more than seven hundred and fifty million fans in theatres in nearly every corner of the world . i would like to welcome an old friend , and co-commentator for this evening 's event -- jimmy michaels .	thank you , bob . the electricity is everywhere tonight . rocky balboa , a fifty-to-one underdog , is living a cinderella story which has captured peoples ' imaginations all over the world -- to quote a popular sports magazine , 'the fighting style should be 'the caveman against the cavalier . ' from the increase in sound it appears the challenger is now approaching the ring ... his record is forty-four wins , twenty losses and thirty-eight knockouts .
you could go deaf with the noise -- it undoubtedly means champion apollo creed is heading towards the ring --	am i seeing right ? creed is approaching the ring in a boat . is he supposed to be george washington ? obviously so .
it 's been confirmed that it is definitely an impersonation of george washington -- a great way to start 1976 off .	i agree .
the champ stings the slower challenger with jabs at will -- balboa blocks eighty percent of the blows with his face -- creed does n't look the best he 's ever been but is moving smoothly -- creed snaps out a triple combination that backs balboa into a corner -- oh , a solid hook by creed , a master of fist-men .	the champion is smiling and toying with the man -- trying to give the fans their money 's worth and make a show of it with the badly out-classes challenger -- another left to right combination . i feel sorry for --
if you had asked anyone who knows boxing , they never would 've predicted a first round knockdown and the second round punishment to the body of the champion ... most fighters will tell you , receiving a good body punch is the next worst thing to dying .	round three ready to start and should be interesting to see if creed can put the challenger away -- there goes the bell .
apollo almost sprints out of his corner -- feints and throws a pair of left-right combinations . balboa drops beneath a left upper cut and lands a very solid shot on creed 's temple -- not much movement from balboa , duck a left , a right , another left and explodes with a right hook to the temple -- i mean explodes . the champ backs off .	there 's no way apollo expected this kind of hitting power .
without a doubt this is the most punishing brawl i have ever seen -- the ringside audience is spotted with blood . this fight should have been stopped rounds ago but rocky balboa refuses to fall --	not only has he refused to fall , but he has beaten the champion 's body without mercy and the bout has become a vicious slugfest .
i say ya nothin ' !	what 's happenin ' here ?
you can forget about sparring , kid .	yo ' know i iz the best man here ! yo ' said so yoself !
why let rocky here take a chance on cuttin ' or breakin ' a hand ? -- take a shower , dipper .	do n't mouth me , old man , i 'll knock yo ' out too . c'mon , wop , spar me , let everybody see who 's got the heat around here .
yo ' yellow , old man .	not yellow , cautious . see , it 's very easy for a fighter to accidentally hurt --
do n't hit the face ! not the face ! !	mr. gazzo wants the two hundred now !
honest to god i 'm broke -- gim me a break .	mr. gazzo says i should get two hundred or break the thumb .
what 's ya name again ?	bob .
a hundred an ' thirty .	that 's it , i 'm broke .
that 's it ? -- completely ?	that 's it .
what about for food an ' stuff ?	you have my food in ya hand .
... the juice is climbin ' every week .	i know the juice is climbin ' -- i been workin ' six months just to pay the damn interest .
ya still light seventy .	waits ! -- be smart . ya do n't have to break nothin ' -- here , take my coat , it 's worth fifty-sixty dollars . it 's yours .
he only had a hundred an ' thirty . -- i think he 's good for the rest next week , mr. gazzo .	sure , rocky , bob 's good for it ...
tomorrow collect from del rio -- he 's late three weeks . how 'd you do last night ?	... fine .
yo rock . did i give you a job this mornin ? how come ya did n't break this guy 's thumb like i asked ya ? when ya do n't do what ya are told , it makes me look bad , kid .	i figure if i break the thumb this guy gets thrown outta his job and ca n't pay nothin ' no more .
next wednesday i grab a grand from snyder . an ' thursday two yards from cappoli , okay ?	no , two yards from snyder , an ' a grand from cappoli .
ya sure ?	hey , screw ya brain on right . now , who 's this girl you 're going out with tonight ?
how 'd you know ?	you think i do n't hear things ?

rocky , would you be interested in --	sparrin ' ?

i 'm sure you are .	absolutely -- sparrin ' with the champ would be an honor -- y'know what ?
what ?	i would n't take no cheap shots . i 'd be a good sparrin ' partner .
rocky , would you be interested in fighting apollo creed for the championship ?	... like i said , i 'd make a boss sparrin ' mate .
did you hear what i said ?	sure , an ' i 'm smart enough to know that no sparrin ' partner should take cheap shots at the champ . he 's just there to help condition the man .
... screw you .	what 'd you say ?
did these guys teach you to talk dirty ? huh ?	hey --
what ?	stuff it , man !

makes your breath like garbage .	maybe i like garbage .
nobody likes garbage -- anyway , this girl with the dirty mouth was n't bad lookin ' , but the guys would n't take her out for any serious datin ' .	why ?
'cause that 's the way guys are -- they laugh when ya talk dirty . they think ya cute for a while , but then ya getta reputation an ' watch out . nobody 's ever gon na take ya serious . ya get no respect ... i got ta use a bad word -- whore . you 'll end up maybe becomin ' a whore .	c'mon , rocky . i 'm twelve .
that does n't matter -- you do n't really have to be a whore , just act like one an ' that 's it .	what ?

so much has happened lately -- has it changed your life style much ?	... people talk to me more .
we can cut that out later . apollo creed says he 'll let you stay three rounds before he puts you away .	apollo 's a great fighter .

this is your largest payday ever -- how do you feel about it ?	feel ? i dunno ... happy .
how will you fight apollo creed ?	creed 's great , ai n't he ... i 'll do what i can .
is it true the most you 've ever made in a prizefight is five hundred dollars ?	four hundred -- but that was a long time ago .
and now your payday will be one hundred and fifty thousand dollars . any comment ?	listen , i wan na say hi to my girlfriend -- yo , adrian !
we do n't serve formula . snookums .	you serve martinis , doncha ?
oh , a ladies man , huh ?	my problem is i got a fifty-year-old lust and a three-year-old dinkie .
no . but neither does roger . that 's diablo red . roger 's pants are sunrise orange .	well , i 'll be ...
make it dry . baby does n't like to be wet . you 're valiant , right ? the name 's baby herman .	i know who you are . kinda out of your neighborhood , are n't you ?
yeah , i had to go slummin ' . see , a friend of mine 's bein ' framed .	you mean the rabbit ? they got him cold .
my problem is i come here to drink in peace . so if you do n't mind ...	c'mon , valiant , does n't this whole thing smell a bit funny to you ? i mean , no offense , but how did a mucky-muck like r.k. maroon find you in the first place ?
and another thing , the paper said no will was found . but every toon knows acme had a will and , in it he promised to leave toontown to the toons .	so where is it then ?
my hunch is it was maroon . he always was after acme 's property .	yeah ? does he wear pants this color ?
gee , it 's swell to see you , eddie . we miss you in toontown .	wish i could say the same . what 're you doin ' here , betty ?
work 's been slow for me since the cartoons went to color . but i still got it , eddie ... 'boop boop be-doop ' .	yeah , you still got it , betty . who 's mr. jocularity ?
that 's marvin acme , the gag king .	shoulda guessed .
he comes here every night to see jessica rabbit .	big on the musical comedy , huh ?
what 's this , roger ?	a tweeting bird ?
please , raoul . i can give you stars , i know i can . just drop the safe on my head one more time .	i 've already dropped it on you twenty-three times .
do n't worry about me . i can take it .	i 'm not worried about you . i 'm worried about the safe .
so , makin ' dame jokes , huh , eddie ? well , lem me remind ya pal , it was a < u > dame < /u > who took a hundred bucks out of the till so your landlord would't throw you out of your dump . and it was a < u > dame < /u > who trusted you for the money when no one else in town would . and it 's a < u > dame < /u > who 's tired of waitin ' for you to straighten yourself out and get a job !	would this be the same dame who 's going to feel awfully foolish when she finds out i 've got her money .
this is fifty bucks . i need seventy-five before they check the books tomorrow .	you 'll have it in the morning . now be a sport and lem me have twenty bucks to put in my pocket .
is this paper even good ?	check the scrawl .
hey , eddie , looks like you really stepped in it this time .	what are you complaining about ? here 's your fifty bucks .
a new outfit bought the red car . some big company called cloverleaf industries .	no kiddin ' ? bought the red cars , huh ?
do you think the rabbit did it ?	i do n't wan na think . i wan na drink .
yeah , eddie , it 's not like you got an ad in the yellow pages .	thanks for the vote of confidence .
the papers said the safe door was opened , eddie .	stick to stuffin ' the olives , willya , dolores ?
so you 're not even gon na bother to find out if the rabbit 's gettin ' framed ?	he 's a toon ... who cares ?
jesus , eddie , is this who i think it is ?	dolores , meet roger rabbit .
he 's a riot .	oh , yeah ? well , you 're not handcuffed to him . anybody in the back room ?
so you decided to help him after all ?	i oughta have my head examined . will you hold still ?
can you get him out of it , eddie ?	if i can find whoever wanted to kill acme bad enough to get this .
so what 's the scam , eddie ?	maybe baby herman was right . somebody wants acme 's property . cack the old man , pin it on roger , and destroy the will .
maybe they just took it out of his pocket .	then why 'd they bother to crack the safe ? you can drop a mosler 90 from mount baldy and it wo n't open .
eddie , you still got it . hey , tomorrow maybe i 'll go down to probate court and see who 's sniffin ' around acme 's estate ?	yeah , do that . i 'm gon na go rattle maroon 's cage .
what was < u > that < /u > ?	< u > that < /u > was the rabbit 's wife .
the rabbit 's wife ? wan na tell me what she was doin ' with her arms around you ?	probably lookin ' for a good place to stick a knife .
i just stopped by to tell you that i checked out the acme probate .	maroon , right ?
nope . it 's that cloverleaf outfit again .	what the hell would they want with a gag factory ?
what 's that comin ' from the bar ?	sounds like singin ' .
i was hopin ' you 'd be there . maroon 's called here about four times . he says he 's got ta talk to you tonight . he says he can help you .	i 'll bet .
are you gon na call him , eddie ?	what 've i got to lose ? you okay , dolores ?
yeah ... they closed me down for a coupla weeks .	that 'll work out just fine . when this thing is over , i 'll take you to catalina . how does that sound ?
he 's not my client . i was workin ' for r.k. maroon .	yes , we talked to mr. maroon . he told us the rabbit became quite agitated when you showed him the pictures , and said nothing would stand in the way of him getting his wife back . is that true ?
men ? they look more like weasles to me .	yes , i find that weasles have a special gift for the work . the rabbit did n't contact you by any chance , did he ?
why would he contact me ? i just took some lousy pictures .	so you would n't have any idea where he might be ?
being caught breaking and entering is not very good advertising for a detective . what were you looking for , mr. valiant ?	ask her ...
marvin acme had no will . i should know , the probate is in my court .	he had a will , all right . she took it off acme the night she and r.k. maroon knocked him off . then she set up her loving husband to take the fall .
they must 've taken it off me .	they ?
take it easy , bongo . we 'll handle mr. valiant our own way ... downtown .	downtown ? fine . get a hold of santino , i 'd be more than glad to talk to him .
you 're not takin ' me to downtown < u > toon < /u > town ?	indeed we are . we 'll continue the interrogation there .
i ai n't tellin ' you nothin ' ! get me santino .	you 're a very stubborn man , mr. valiant . very pig-headed . boys , show mr. valiant how we handle pig-headed men at the toontown station ...
i do n't think it 's gon na matter . sorry , pal , i tried .	yes , and for that you 're charged with aiding and abetting . but we 'll let santino handle that .
well , why not ? i 'm feeling magnanimous tonight . the successful conclusion of this case draws the curtain on my career as a jurist . i 'm retiring to take a new role in the private sector .	yeah ? well , do n't expect the toons to give you a gold watch .
these roads can be very treacherous at night , especially in a maniacal toon vehicle .	the pot 's callin ' the kettle maniacal .
no matter . i do n't expect the will to show up in the next fifteen minutes . by then cloverleaf will own toontown quite legally .	so you 're cloverleaf ?
come on , doom . what would a company like that want with toontown ?	it was n't toontown they wanted . it was my idea of how to put the land to better use .
do n't you think anyone 's gon na notice that toontown 's gone ?	they wo n't care . who 's going to miss some ridiculous talking mice when they can have the future ?
right here where we 're standing , will be the cornerstone of my idea ... the cloverleaf -- an elegant cement structure that intertwines freeways .	what the hell 's a freeway ?
a freeway , mr. valiant , is eight lanes of asphalt running uninterrupted from l.a. to pasadena . pasadena to hollywood . hollywood to santa monica . someday everyone will be in cars driving happily , non-stop from one end of the l.a. basin to another .	that 's what this is all about ? tell me , who 's gon na use your lousy freeway ? we got the red cars , the best public transportation in the country .
holy shit , he 's a toon !	surprised ?
you ?	that 's right , me .
here 's one for the books ... a toon wearin ' human clothes .	earl ... it 's me , valiant .
eddie ? jesus , what happened ?	toon cops worked me over .
boy , i 'll say . they gave you a real toon-a-roo .	what am i , earl ?
you 're a pig ... a happy-go-lucky pig .	no ...
does it hurt ?	not much . it 's hard to talk .
last week some heavy breather wanted one of my nylons as a souvenir . maybe that 's what he was after ?	look , doll , if i wanted underwear , i woulda broken into frederick 's of hollywood . i was lookin ' for marvin acme 's will .
hello , mr. valiant . i rang the doorbell , but i guess you could n't hear it .	that 's because i do n't have a doorbell .
oh ... well , i ... i just had to see you .	okay , you 've seen me . now give me a towel .
come on , lady , have n't you ever seen a mole before ?	toons are n't given imperfections .
no ? i guess we 're not counting lying , stealing and murder .	you 've got the wrong idea about me . i'a a pawn in this just like poor roger . can you help me find him ? i 'll pay you anything .
yeah , i 'll bet you would . you got ta have the rabbit to make the scam work .	no , no , no ... i love my husband .
oh , sure . i can just feature you standin ' outside your little hutch , holdin ' a carrot cake waitin ' for hubby to come home .	oh , please do n't make fun of me , mr , valiant . you do n't know how hard it is being a woman looking the way i do .
yeah , well , you do n't know how hard it is bein ' a man looking at a woman looking the way you do .	i 'm not bad , i 'm just drawn that way .
so altruistic .	it 's the truth . why wo n't you believe it ?
cause i do n't take acme dumb pills . i do n't know what you 're up to , lady , but i 'm gon na nail you for the acme murder .	if i 'm as bad as you think , what 's stopping me from just killing you right now ?
you shot roger .	that 's not roger . it 's one of doom 's men . he killed r.k. maroon .
lady , i guess i had you pegged wrong .	do n't worry , you 're not the first . we better get out of here .
it was doom who killed acme , you know ?	why did n't you tell me ?
i did n't know who i could trust .	we 're even . by the way , i did find your husband .
where is he ?	he 's right here in the ...
how did you get onto doom ?	marvin told me . doom was after his land . ne was afraid . that 's why he brought me his will .
so where is it ?	when i opened up the blue envelope , all that was inside was a blank piece of paper .
looks like our goose is cooked , our hash is slung , our fait is accompli ...	lem me guess where you got that from . tell me somethin ' , what 'd you ever see in that guy anyway ?
hold on a second .	eddie , come on .
tell me you did n't do a snoop job for a toon named roger the rabbit .	that 's what you woke me up for ?
now what ?	just have n't been this close to toontown for awhile .
they say the rabbit got the safe idea from a cartoon he was makin ' the other day .	what a gasser .
where 'd this gargoyle come from anyway ?	no one knows . he bought the election a few years back . he 's been rulin ' toontown ever since .
what 's with the dip ?	that 's how he gets rid of the troublemakers . it 's a combination of acetone , turpentine and paint remover . he calls it the ... final solution .
what the hell is that ?	doom .
valiant , did you see the rabbit ?	he was blowin ' his lines , all right . so what ?
how much do you know about show business , valiant ?	only there 's no business like it , no business i know .
yeah , and there 's no business as expensive . i 'm twenty-five grand over budget on the latest bunnysitter cartoon and it 's all because that rabbit ca n't keep his mind on his work . and you know why ?	one too many safes dropped on his head ?
here 's the problem ... `` seen cooing over calamari with notsonew sugar daddy was jessica rabbit ... wife of maroon star , roger '' . his wife 's a tramp , but he thinks she 's betty crocker . the doubt 's eatin ' him up .	so what do you want me to do ?
get me a couple juicy pictures . somethin ' i can wise the rabbit up with .	i do n't work in toontown .
you do n't have to . the rabbit 's wife sings at an underground toon revue joint called the ink & paint club . you can catch her in action there .	the job 's gon na cost you a hundred bucks .
a hundred bucks ? that 's ridiculous .	so 's the job .
i got him on loan from disney .	are n't you the lucky one ...
when will i hear from you ?	as soon as is humanly possible .
well , you better start thinkin ' about drinkin ' it black .	frankly , i 'm shocked . marvin acme 's been my friend and neighbor for thirty years .
son-of-a-bitch ... mr. maroon , i think i 'll be goin ' now , so about the rest of my fee ...	sure , valiant , sure ...
hi , mr. maroon . remember me ?	valiant ? what 're you doin ' here ?
i just thought i 'd drop by and show you a photograph .	i 've already seen your photographs .
maroon ? whaddaya want ?	have you got the will ?
maybe . why ?	meet me at my studio at nine o'clock . if you 've got the will maybe we can stop this thing .
valiant ! you surprised me .	that was the idea .
you 're not too good at this , are you , r.k. ?	no ... i 'm not . i 'm a cartoon maker , not a murderer .
well , everybody needs a hobby .	no , you got ta understand , valiant , i had nothin ' to do with acme gettin ' killed . i just wanted to sell my studio . but they would n't buy my property unless acme would sell his . and he would n't . so i was gon na blackmail acme with pictures of him and the rabbit 's wife .
you got the will in there , do n't ya ?	no , i do n't .
you tricked me , damn you !	take it easy .
pattycake ! pattycake !	baker 's man ... but no use ruinin ' a good pair of shoes over it .
my advice ? hop on over to reno , get yourself a quickie divorce .	divorce ? never !
aah !	aah !
what the hell are you doin ' ?	i needed a place to hide . i 'm in trouble , eddie .
so i hear . even talkin ' to you could get me a rap for aiding and abetting .	do n't worry , eddie , no one knows i 'm here .
oh , yeah ? then how 'd you find my house ?	well , i asked the newsboy on the corner . he did n't know . then i asked a janitor , the fireman and finally the green grocer down the way . he was very helpful .
look , pal , if you 're still here when i finish this drink , i 'm callin ' the police .	do n't do that ! i 'm innocent i tell ya . the police 'll just dip me . they were waitin ' for me when i got home last night . i ran .
if you 're so innocent , why 'd you run ?	gee , eddie , i 'm a rabbit . we always run .
eddie valiant ... you 're under arrest ! just kidding ...	you idiot . i lost the key for those cuffs .
hey ! what do you think you 're doin ' ?	sorry , eddie , i forgot you 're not a toon .
does this help ?	yeah , that 's better .
you mean to tell me you coulda taken your hand outta that cuff at any time ?	well , no , not < u > any < /u > time . only when it was funny .
are you always this funny , or only on days when you 're wanted for murder ?	my philosophy is if you do n't have a sense of humor , you 're better off dead .
yeah . i think maroon plays the part of the sound mind , your wife the sound body .	i resent that innuendo ! my wife is completely innocent .
the habeus corpus is thickening .	yeah . except they screwed up . i do n't think they got the will .
how do you know that ?	well , acme had the will in his pocket that night at the club . it was gone in the morning when the cops found the body .
well , mr. smarty-pants detective , your logic is specious . what prevented mr. acme from putting the will back in the safe before they killed him ?	because he 's not forty feet tall . the safe was up on the ceiling , remember ?
hey , do n't i get an encore ?	why , you crazy toon ... i 've been out there riskin ' my neck for you . i come back here and you 're singin ' and dancin ' .
but that 's my calling , my purpose , my raison d'etre . toons are supposed to make people laugh ... and believe me , those people needed a laugh .	and when they 're done laughin ' , they 're gon na call the cops . that guy angelo would rat on you for a nickel !
angelo ? he 's a pal , a chum ...	an arsonist and a kidnapper . he just got outta prison .
well ... i still do n't think he 'd turn me in .	just because you got 'em to laugh ?
a laugh can be a powerful thing , eddie . sometimes it 's the only weapon we have in life .	i think i prefer the smith and wesson variety .
i 've met some cynical and miserable humans in my time . but you , edward valiant , are positively funereal !	well , right now it 's gon na be your funereal .
hey , does n't the rabbit even get a last request ?	a blindfold , cigarette , noseplugs ? just kidding .
here you go , kid ... say hi to casper for me .	but , eddie , you know what happens when ...
oh , eddie , that was quick thinkin ' . nothin ' like usin ' the old noggin , the noodle , the grey matter ...	if i 'm so smart , how come i 'm runnin ' from the law with a toon ?
valiant and valiant ? who 's the other valiant ?	my brother . get inside .
so what 's our plan , our scenario , our modus operandi ?	we ca n't do anything till it 's dark .
say , who 's this guy laughin ' ?	me .
gee , i did n't recognize you ... i 've never seen you laugh before . that your brother makin ' the rabbit ears ?	what is this , twenty questions ?
you damn toon ! no wonder they picked you for the patsy . always got ta play the fool . you make me sick !	gee , you shamuses are a tough audience , but what happened to you that was so dark , lurid , embittering ?
you wan na know ? well , since you 're so goddamn curious , i 'll tell ya . one of you toons killed my brother .	a toon ? noooo .
yeah , a toon . it was the guy who killed bambi 's mother .	him ? oh , he was vile , heinous , despicable ... a smear on the drafting board .
yeah , everybody thought so . but me and teddy got a kick out of toons . all toons . we could n't see the bad in 'em . and when this guy was accused of knockin ' over the first national bank of toontown , we took his case . but when we looked into it , we found out he did do it after all . we went to his house to take him in . but he was wise . he got the drop on us ... literally .	safe ?
i 'll get it .	get away from there .
wrong number ?	no , it 's not .
gee , eddie , you 're not gon na go , are ya ? maroon 'll be layin ' for ya at nine o'clock .	that 's why i 'll be there at 8:45 .
i tell you what , maybe i better come with you .	forget it .
you know , eddie , i 'm not as much of a chump , and a patsy , a yokel as you think .	how much is a shave and a haircut , roger ?
two bits .	i rest my case .
if i do n't make it back here by ten ...	yeah ?
what the hell are you doin ' in there ?	i followed you to the maroon studios . when i heard those shots , i thought i 'd help you and investigate the inside of this trunk .
real good , rog ... but maybe you better let me take over .	not before i satisfy my sense of moral outrage .
that 's not blood . that 's ink . that goof acme squirted me with some the other day . why it 's comin ' 'through now , i do n't know .	that 's because it 's disappearing-reappearing ink . shows up three days later . gives you enough time to get away from the victim so he does n't punch you in the nose . great gag .
say roger , remember that love letter you wrote your wife at the ink & paint club ?	yeah ?
i think you oughta read it to her .	good idea .
keep reading ...	hey , it 's the will . i , marvin acme , of sound mind and body , hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo , do hereby bequeath in perpetuity the property known as toontown to those loveable characters ...
no , kid , you 're a real hero .	i guess i am at that . cigar ?
by the way , roger , you were right about your wife . she 's a good lady . i 'm glad you got her back .	and i 'm glad you got your sense of humor back . think you 'll keep it ?
pretty good cigar . where 'd you get it ?	from this box here ...
boo ! ah , ha ha . ooh . boo ! ha ha ha .	i will bite my thumb at them ; which is a disgrace to them , if they bear it .
do you bite your thumb at us , sir ?	i do bite my thumb , sir !
do you bite your thumb at us ? sir .	[ aside to gregory ] is the law on our side , if i say ay ?
quarrel sir ! no , sir .	if you do , sir , i am for you . i serve as good a man as you .
no better ?	uh ? uh ?
if she is well then nothing can be ill. her body rests in capel 's monument , and her immortal part with the angel 's lives . i saw her laid low . pardon me for bringing these ill news .	then i defy you , stars ! juliet ! juliet ! i will hence tonight .
have patience !	leave me !
your looks are pale and wild and do import some misadventure .	tush , thou art deceived . hast thou no letters to me from the priest ? [ balthsasr shakes his head no . ] no matter . well , juliet , i will lie with thee tonight . i will hence tonight .
live and be prosperous ; and farewell good fellow .	then i 'll leave thee .
romeo ! romeo !	romeo ! humours ! madman ! passion ! lover ! i conjure thee by rosaline 's bright eyes , by her high forehead and her scarlet lip , by her fine foot , straight leg and quivering thigh ! o , romeo that she were an open ass , and thou a poperin pear ! romeo , good night : i 'll to my truckle-bed ; this field-bed is too cold for me to sleep .
where the devil should this romeo be ? came he not home to-night ?	not to his father 's ; i spoke with his man .
why that pale hard-hearted wench , that rosaline . torments him so , that he will sure run mad .	tybalt , the kinsman of old capulet , hath sent a letter to his father 's house .
a challenge , on my life .	romeo will answer it ?
any man that can write may answer a letter .	nay , he will answer the letter 's master , how he dares , being dared .
but alas poor romeo ! he is already dead ; stabbed with a white wench 's black eye ; shot through the ear with a love-song ; the very pin of his heart cleft with the blind bow-boy 's butt-shaft : and is he a man to encounter tybalt ?	why , what is tybalt ?
more than prince of cats . he is the courageous captain of compliments . he fights as you sing prick- song , keeps time , distance , and proportion ; he rests his minim rest , one , two , and the third in your bosom : the very butcher of a silk button , a duellist , a duellist ; a gentleman of the very first house , of the first and second cause : the immortal passado ! punto reverso ! the hai !	the what ?
keep away the cats ! thou art like one of these fellows that , when he enters the confines of a tavern claps me his sword upon the table and says , & quot ; god send me no need of thee. & quot ; and by the operation of the second cup draws him on the drawer , when indeed there is no need .	am i like such a fellow ?
thou art as hot a jack in thy mood as any in verona .	by my head here come the capulets .
either withdraw unto some private place , or reason coldly of your grievences , or else depart . here all eyes gaze on us .	men 's eyes were made to look , and let them gaze . i will not budge for no man 's pleasure , i .
why then , o brawling love , o loving hate , o anything of nothing first create . heavy lightness . serious vanity . misshapen chaos of well seeming forms .	good-morrow , cousin .
is the day so young ?	but new struck cuz .
ay me ! sad hours seem long . was that my father that went hence so fast ?	it was . what sadness lengthens romeo 's hours ?
not having that , which , having , makes them short .	in love ?
out --	of love ?
out of her favour , where i am in love .	alas , that love , so gentle in his view , should be so tyrannous and rough in proof !
alas , that love , whose view is muffled still , should , without eyes , see pathways to his will ! where shall we dine ? o me ! what fray was here ? yet tell me not , for i have heard it all . here 's much to do with hate , but more with love . why , then , o brawling love ! o loving hate ! o any thing , of nothing first create ! o heavy lightness ! serious vanity ! misshapen chaos of well-seeming forms ! feather of lead -- [ benvolio snickers ] dost thou not laugh ?	no , cuz , i rather weep .
good heart , at what ?	at thy good heart 's oppression .
farewell , my cuz .	soft ! i will go along ; an if you leave me so , you do me wrong .
tell me in sadness , who is that you love .	in sadness , cousin , i do love a woman .
i aim 'd so near , when i supposed you loved .	a right good marks-man ! and she 's fair i love .
a right fair mark , fair cuz , is soonest hit .	well , in that hit you miss : she 'll not be hit with cupid 's arrow ; nor bide the encounter of assailing eyes , nor open her lap to saint-seducing gold :
then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste ?	she hath , and in that sparing makes huge waste .
be ruled by me , forget to think of her .	teach me how i should forget to think .
by giving liberty unto thine eyes ; examine other beauties . why , romeo , art thou mad ?	not mad , but bound more than a mad-man is ; shut up in prison , kept without my food , whipp 'd and tormented . good day , good fellow .
every man betake him to his legs .	but 't is no wit to go .
this wind , you talk of , blows us from ourselves ; supper is done , and we shall come too late .	i fear , too early : for my mind misgives some consequence yet hanging in the stars shall bitterly begin his fearful date with this night 's revels and expire the term of a despised life closed within my breast by some vile forfeit of untimely death . but he , that hath the steerage of my course , direct my sail ! on , lusty gentlemen .
forbear this outrage , good mercutio .	art thou hurt ?
what dares the slave come hither , to fleer and scorn at our solemnity ? now , by the stock and honour of my kin , to strike him dead , i hold it not a sin .	why , how now , kinsman ! wherefore storm you so ?
uncle , this is that villain romeo , a montague , our foe .	young romeo is it ?
't is he .	content thee , gentle cuz , content thee . let him alone ; i would not for the wealth of all the town here in my house do him disparagement : therefore be patient , take no note of him
i 'll not endure him .	he shall be endured
uncle , 't is a shame .	go to ! what , goodman boy ! i say , he shall : go to ; make a mutiny among my guests ? !
such mortal drugs i have , but verona 's law is death to any that utters them .	the world is not thy friend , nor the worlds law . then be not poor , but break it , and take this .
my poverty , but not my will consents .	i pay thy poverty , and not thy will .
drink it off and , if you had the strength of twenty men it would dispatch you straight .	here is my gold . worse poison to men 's souls , than these poor compounds that thou mayest not sell .
are you at leisure holy father , now ? or shall i come to you at evening mass ?	my leisure serves me , pensive daughter now . we must entreat the time alone .
it strains me past the compass of my wits .	if in thy wisdom thou canst give no help do thou but call my resolution wise , and with this i 'll help it presently !
hold daughter !	be not so long to speak i long to die .
i do spy a kind of hope , which craves as desperate and execution as that is desperate which we would prevent . if , rather than to marry paris , thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself , then it is likely thou wilt undertake a thing like death , to chide away this shame . no warmth , no breath shall testify thou livest . each part , deprived of supple government , shall stiff and stark and cold appear , like death . now when the bridegroom in the morning comes to rouse thee from thy bed , there art thou dead . thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault where all he kindred to the capulet lie . in the meantime , against thou shalt awake , shall romeo by my letters know our drift , and hither shall he come . and that very night shall romeo bear thee hence to mantua . take thou this vial , being then in bed , and this distilling liquor drink thou off . i 'll send my letters to thy lord post haste to mantua .	what if this mixture do not work at all ? shall i be married then tomorrow morning ?
good marrow , father !	benedicite ! what early tounge so sweet saludeth me ?
young son , it argues a distemper 'd head so soon to bid good marrow to thy bed : or if not so so , then here i hit it right , our romeo hath not seen his bed tonight .	the last is true ; the sweeter rest was mine .
god pardon sin , was thou with rosaline ! ?	rosaline ? my ghostly father no ; i have forgot that name , and that name 's woe .
that 's my good son : but where hast thou been	i have been feasting with mine enemy , where on a sudden one hath wounded me , that 's by me wounded ; both our remeidies within thy help and holy physic lies .
be plain , good son , and homely in thy drift ; riddling confession finds but riddling shrift .	then plainly know my hearts dear love is set , on the fair daughter of rich capulet . we met , we wooed , we made exchange of vow . i 'll tell thee as we pass ; but this i pray , that thou consent to marry us today .
holy saint francis , what a change is here ! is rosaline that thou didst love so dear so soon forsaken ? young men 's love then lies not truly in their hearts but in their eyes .	thou chid'st me oft for loving rosaline .
for doting ; not for loving , pupil mine .	i pray thee , chde me not ; whom i love now doth grace for grace and love for love allow ; the other did not so .
o , she new well . thy love read by rote and could not spell . come , young waverer , come , go with me , in one respect i 'll thy assistant be ; for this alliance may so happy prove , to turn you household rachor to pure love .	o , let us hence ; i stand on sudden haste .
banishment ? be merciful , say death ; for exile hath more terror in his look much more than death . do not say banishment .	affliction is enamoured of thy parts , and thou art wedded to calamity . hence from verona art thou banished . be patient , for the world is broad and wide .
there is no world without verona walls , hence banished is banished from the world and worlds exile is death . then banished is death mis-termed . calling death banished , thou cu'st my head off with a golden axe and smiles upon the stroke that murders me .	o deadly sin , o rude unthankfulness ! this is dear mercy and thou sees it not . hence !
how well my comfort is revived by this .	hie you make haste ! but look thou stay not till the watch be set , for then thou canst not pass to mantua where thau shalt live till we can find a time to blaze you marriage , reconcile your friends , beg pardon of the prince and call thee back with twenty hundred times more joy , than thou wentst forth in lamentation . quick hence ! be gone by break of day ! sojourn in mantua .
as the custom is , in all her best array , bear her to church .	and all this day an unaccustomed spirit lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts . i dreampt my lady came and found me dead and breathed such life with kisses in my lips that i revived and was an emperor . ah me , how sweet is love itself possessed when but love 's shadow 's are so rich in joy . news from verona . how now , balthasar ? ! dost thou not bring me letters from the priest ? how doth my lady ? is my father well ? how doth my lady juliet ? for nothing can be ill if she be well .
juliet !	o , mighty is the powerful grace that lies in plants , herbs , stones , and their true qualities : for nought so vile that the earth doth live but to the earth some special good doth give , nor aught so good , but strain 'd from that fair use revolts from true birth , stumbling on abuse : virtue itself turns vice , being misaplied ; and vice sometimes by action dignified . within the infant rind of this weak flower poison is resident and medicine power : for this , being smelt , with that part cheers each part ; being tasted , slays all senses with the heart . two such empossed kings encamp them still in man as well as herbs , grace and rude will ; and where the worser is predominant , full soon the canker death eats up that plant .
i come for my lady juliet .	welcome .
where is my lady 's lord ?	romeo , come forth .
i thought thy disposition better tempered ! thy juliet is alive . there art thou happy . the law that threatened death becomes thy friend and turns it to exile . there art thou happy . a pack of blessings light upon thy back . wherefore railest thou on thy birth the heaven and earth ? since birth and heaven and earth all three do meet in thee at once .	sir , a ring my lady bid me give you .
o god . did romeo 's hand shed tybalt 's blood ? o serpent heart hid with a flowering face . was ever book containing such vile matter 's so fairly bound ? o , that deceit should dwell in such a gorgeous palace .	she 'll not come down tonight .
thou hast a careful father , child : one who , to put thee from thy heaviness , hath sorted out a sudden day of joy that thou expects nor i looked not for .	madam , in happy time what day is that ?
marry my child next thursday morn . the gallant , young and noble gentleman , sir paris , at saint peter 's church , shall make thee there a joyful bride .	what ? now . st. peter 's church , and peter too , he shall not make me there a joyful bride !
o sweet my mother cast me not away . delay this marriage for a month , a week . or if you do not make the bridal bed in that dim monument where tybalt lies .	talk not to me , for ill not speak a word . do as thou wilt for i have done with thee .
what , daughter are you busy ? need you my help ?	no , madam . we have culled such necessaries as our behoveful for our state tomorrow . so please you , let me now be left alone , and let the nurse this night sit up with you . for i am sure you have your hands full in all this so sudden business .
geth thee to be and rest , for thou has need .	farewell . god knows when we shall meet again .
goodnight .	romeo , i drink to thee .
i bade her come . god forbid ! juliet ! juliet ! juliet !	madam , i am here . what is your will ?
juliet !	three words , dear romeo , and good night indeed . if that thy bent of love be honourable , thy purpose marriage , send me word to-morrow , by one that i 'll procure to come to thee , where and what time thou wilt perform the rite ; and all my fortunes at thy foot i 'll lay and follow thee my lord throughout the world .
[ within ] juliet !	i uh , by and by i come -- but if thou mean'st not well , i do beseech thee --
[ within ] juliet !	by and by , i come : -- to cease thy strief , and leave me to my grief : to-morrow will i send .
o honey nurse , what news ? nurse ?	i am a-weary , give me leave awhile : fie , how my bones ache ! what a jaunt have i !
i would thou hadst my bones , and i thy news : i pray thee , speak .	what haste ? can you not stay awhile ? do you not see that i am out of breath ?
how art thou out of breath , when thou hast breath to say to me that thou art out of breath ? is the news good , or bad ? answer to that ;	well , you have made a simple choice ; you know not how to choose a man : romeo ! no , not he ; though his face be better than any man 's , yet his leg excels all men 's ; and for a hand , and a foot , and a body ,
but all this did i know before . what says he of our marriage ? what of that ?	lord , how my head aches ! what a head have i ! o , my back ! other ' other side , -- o , my back .
i ' faith , i am sorry that thou art not well . sweet , sweet , sweet nurse , tell me , what says my love ?	your love says , like an honest gentleman , and a courteous , and a kind , and a handsome , and , i warrant , a virtuous , -- where is your mother ?
where is my mother ! how oddly thou repliest ! your love says , like an honest gentleman , where is your mother ? '	o lady dear ! are you so hot ? henceforward do your messages yourself .
here 's such a coil ! come , what says romeo ?	have you got leave to go to confession to-day ?
i have .	then hie you hence to father laurence ' cell ; there stays a husband to make you a wife
faith , here it is . i think it best you marry with this paris . o , he 's a lovely gentleman . i think you are happy in this second match , for it excels your first ; or if it did not , your first is dead -- or 'twere as good he were as living here and you no use to him .	speakest thou from thy heart ?
and from my soul too . else beshrew them both .	amen
what ?	well , thou hast comforted me marvelous much . go in and tell my lady i am gone , having displeased my father to father lawrence to make confession and be absolved .
did my heart love till now ? forswear it , sight ! for i ne'er saw true beauty till this night .	if i profane with my unworthiest hand this holy shrine , the gentle sin is this : my lips , two blushing pilgrims , ready stand to smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss .
good pilgrim , you do wrong your hand too much , which mannerly devotion shows in this ; for saints have hands that pilgrims ' hands do touch , and palm to palm is holy palmers ' kiss .	have not saints lips , and holy palmers too ?
ay , pilgrim , lips that they must use in prayer .	well , then , dear saint , let lips do what hands do ; they pray , grant thou , lest faith turn to despair .
saints do not move , though grant for prayers ' sake .	then move not , while my prayer 's effect i take . thus from my lips , by yours , my sin is purged .
then have my lips the sin that they have took .	sin from my lips ? o trespass sweetly urged ! give me my sin again .
he jests at scars that never felt a wound . but , soft ! what light through yonder window breaks ? it is the east , and juliet is the sun . arise , fair sun , and kill the envious moon , who is already sick and pale with grief , that thou her maid art far more fair than she : be not her maid , since she is envious ; her vestal livery is but sick and green and none but fools do wear it ; oh cast it off . it is my lady , o , it is my love ! o , that she knew she were !	ay me !
she speaks : o , speak again , bright angel !	romeo , o romeo ! wherefore art thou romeo ? deny thy father and refuse thy name ; or , if thou wilt not , be but sworn my love , and i 'll no longer be a capulet .
[ aside ] shall i hear more , or shall i speak at this ?	't is but thy name that is my enemy ; thou art thyself , though not a montague . what 's montague ? it is nor hand , nor foot , nor arm , nor face , nor any other part belonging to a man . o , be some other name ! what 's in a name ? that which we call a rose by any other word would smell as sweet ; so romeo would , were he not romeo call 'd , retain that dear perfection which he owes without that title . o romeo , doff thy name , and for that name which is no part of thee take all myself .
i take thee at thy word .	ahhh !
art thou not romeo and a montague ?	neither , fair maid , if either thee dislike .
how camest thou hither , tell me , and wherefore ? the garden walls are high and hard to climb , and the place death , considering who thou art , if any of my kinsmen find thee here .	with love 's light wings did i o'er-perch these walls ; for stony limits can not hold love out , and what love can do that dares love attempt ; therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me .
if they do see thee , they will murder thee .	i have night 's cloak to hide me from their eyes , and but thou love me , let them find me here : my life were better ended by their hate , than death prorogued , wanting of thy love .
thou know'st the mask of night is on my face , else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek for that which thou hast heard me speak to-night fain would i dwell on form , fain , fain deny what i have spoke : but farewell compliment ! dost thou love me ? i know thou wilt say 'ay , ' and i will take thy word : yet if thou swear'st , thou mayst prove false . o gentle romeo , if thou dost love , pronounce it faithfully :	lady , by yonder blessed moon i swear that tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops --
o , swear not by the moon , the inconstant moon , that monthly changes in her circled orb , lest that thy love prove likewise variable .	well what shall i swear by ?
do not swear at all ; or , if thou wilt , swear by thy gracious self , which is the god of my idolatry , and i 'll believe thee .	if my heart 's dear love --
do not swear : although i joy in thee , i have no joy of this contract to-night : it is too rash , too unadvised , too sudden ; too like the lightning , which doth cease to be ere one can say 'it lightens . ' sweet , good night ! this bud of love , by summer 's ripening breath , may prove a beauteous flower when next we meet . good night .	o , wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied ?
what satisfaction canst thou have to-night ?	the exchange of thy love 's faithful vow for mine .
so thrive my soul --	a thousand times good night ! exit , above
a thousand times the worse , to want thy light . love goes toward love , as schoolboys from their books , but love from love , toward school with heavy looks .	romeo ! at what o'clock to-morrow shall i send to thee ?
by the hour of nine .	i will not fail : 't is twenty year till then .
come gentle night . come loving black-browned night give me my romeo . and when i shall die , take him and cut him out into little stars , and he will make the face of heaven so fine that all the world will be in love with night and pay no worship to the garish sun . o , i have bought the mansion of love but not possessed , and though i am sold , not yet enjoyed . o , tedious is this day , as the night before some festival to an impatient child that hath new robes and may not wear them .	mercutio 's soul is but a little way above our heads staying for thine to keep him company !
wilt thou be gone ? it is not yet near day .	i must be gone and live , or stay and die .
that light is not daylight , i know it , i. it is some meteor that the sun exhales to light thee on thy way to mantua . therefore stay yet . thou needest not be gone .	let me be taken , let me be put to death . i have more care to stay then will to go . come death , welcome , juliet wills it so . how is't my soul ? let us talk it is not day .
it is , it is ! hie hence , be gone , away . o , now be gone . more light and light it grows .	more light and light , more dark and dark our woes .
then window , let day in and let life out . o , think'st thou we shall ever meet again ?	i doubt it not . trust me , love , all these woes shall serve for sweet discourses in our times to come . adieu .
romeo . what 's here ? poison . drunk all , and left no friendly drop to help me after . i will kiss thy lips . happily some poison yet doth hang on them . thy lips are warm .	thus ... .. with a kiss ... ... i die .
nurse , give leave awhile , we must talk in secret . nurse , come back again ; i have remember 'd me , thou 's hear our counsel . nurse , thou know'st my daughter 's of a pretty age .	thou wast the prettiest babe that e'er i nursed .
by my count , i was your mother much upon these years , you are now a maid . thus then in brief : the valiant paris seeks you for his love .	a man , young lady ! lady , such a man as all the world- -why , he 's a man of wax .
verona 's summer hath not such a flower .	nay , he 's a flower ; in faith , a very flower .
this night you shall behold him at our feast ; read o'er the volume of young paris ' face , and find delight writ there with beauty 's pen ; this precious book of love , this unbound lover , to beautify him , only lacks a cover : so shall you share all that he doth possess , by having him , making yourself no less .	nay , bigger ; women grow by men .
go ! we follow thee . juliet , blah !	go , girl , seek happy nights to happy days .
young hearts run free . never be caught up , caught up like rosaline and thee . nay , gentle romeo , we must have you dance .	not i , not i believe me : you have dancing shoes with nimble soles : i have a soul of lead
you are a lover ; borrow cupid 's wings , and soar with them above a common bound .	under love 's heavy burden do i sink .
too great oppression for a tender thing .	is love a tender thing ? it is too rough , too rude , too boisterous , and it pricks like thorn .
why , may one ask ?	i dream 'd a dream to-night .
and so did i .	well , what was yours ?
that dreamers often lie .	in bed asleep , while they do dream things true .
o , then , i see queen mab hath been with you . she is the fairies ' midwife , and she comes in shape no bigger than an agate-stone on the fore-finger of an alderman , drawn with a team of little atomies over men 's noses as they lie asleep ; her chariot is an empty hazel-nut her wagoner a small grey-coated gnat , and in this state she gallops night by night through lovers ' brains , and then they dream of love ; o'er lawyers ' fingers , who straight dream on fees , sometime she driveth o'er a soldier 's neck , and then dreams he of cutting foreign throats , and being thus frighted swears a prayer or two and sleeps again . this is the hag , when maids lie on their backs , that presses them and learns them first to bear , making them women of good carriage : this is she -- this is she !	peace , good mercutio , peace ! thou talk'st of nothing .
away , begone ; the sport is at the best .	ay , so i fear ; the more is my unrest .
ho ho , capital punks !	signior romeo , bon jour ! there 's a french salutation to your french slop . you gave us the counterfeit fairly last night .
good morrow to you both . what counterfeit did i give you ?	the slip , son , the slip ; can you not conceive ?
pardon , good mercutio , my business was great ; and in such a case as mine a man may strain courtesy .	that 's as much as to say , such a case as yours constrains a man to bow in the hams .
meaning , to court'sy .	thou hast most kindly hit it .
a most courteous exposition .	nay , i am the very pink of courtesy .
pink for flower .	right .
why , then is my pump well flowered .	sure witt ! now art thou sociable , now art thou romeo ; now art thou what thou art , by art as well as by nature .
i will follow you .	farewell , ancient lady ; farewell ,
ay , ay , a scratch , a scratch . ay , a scratch , a scratch . ha ha ha .	courage man , the hurt can not be much .
'twill serve . ask for me tomorrow and you shall find me a grave man . a plague o ' both your houses . they have made worms meat of me . a plague on both your houses ! why the devil did you come between us ? i was hurt under your arm .	i thought all for the best .
a plague o ' both your houses .	no ! mercutio !
follow me close . gentlemen , gooday . a word with one of you ?	oh , and but one word with one of us ? couple it with something . make it a word and a ... a blow .
you shall find me apt enough to that , sir . and you will give me occasion .	could you not take some occasion without giving ?
mercutio ! thou art consortest with romeo ?	consort ? what does thou make us minstrels ? an thou make minstrels of us look to hear nothing of discords . here 's my fiddlestick . here 's that shall make you dance ! zounds , consort !
calm , dishonorable , vile submission ! thou art my souls hate ! tybalt ! you ratcatcher , will you walk ?	what wouldst thou have with me ?
good king of cat 's , nothing but one of your nine lives .	i am for you .
madam , your mother craves a word with you . come lets away .	is she a capulet ?
if ye should lead her into a fool 's paradise , as they say , it were a very gross kind of behavior , as they say : for the lady is young ; and , therefore , if you should deal double with her , truly it were an ill thing , and very weak dealing .	bid her to come to confession this afternoon ; and there she shall at father laurence ' cell be shrived and married .
nurse .	sir . ah , sir . death the end of all
o , she says nothing sir , but weeps and weeps , and then on romeo cries and then falls down again .	as if that name , shot from the deadly level of a gun did murder her , as that name 's cursed hand did murder her kinsman .
do you have it ?	always in a rush , you are . all these years i 've known you , you could never wait for anything .
this is important .	do you really think so ?
why did you do that ?	to make a point . i do n't know her , and i was ready to splatter her brains all over the sidewalk . i do n't particularly like you , so imagine what i 'll do if you try anything ...
it 's under your seat .	what ?
coordinate all you want , but make sure whatever you do gets cleared through me . are we in sync on this , vincent ?	of course .
we kept it ...	is that right ?
while sam and i take out the back two cars ...	leaving ...
and then sam , you and i clean up whatever 's left to be cleaned .	very good . now all we have to do is live long enough to get paid .
of course .	finding this package is a thing easier said than done . we do n't even know what it is . what did we steal ?
i do n't know .	when this whole thing started you made it clear : you 're running the show . and i do n't believe you 'd be running this show if you did n't know what was going on .
well i do n't !	and i do n't believe you ...
you go shoot me if you want , vincent , but you 'll be dead before i hit the ground .	i do n't want you dead , woman , i want the the truth !
only the stupid ones . cigarettes kill more patriots than bullets . besides , i 'm not ira no more .	so where do you go from here ?
i do n't know . i was thinking ... maybe the three of us might partner up -- guns for hire , that sort of thing .	i 'm up for that ...
it 's good to see you 've all got such faith in our little undertaking .	who the fuck are you ?
i drive -- and my name is larry . larry from the states .	and who are you ?
so what 's the deal ?	the deal ? the deal is we leave for nice at first light .
you call me with the target 's route , i follow along until we 've reached the attack point and then i run his squag ass off the road .	which leads us to ...
then swede and i split with the package and meet you back at the rendezvous .	and then ...
and you believed me ? but it was n't my people who did it .	how do we know that ?
i never did trust that blonde fuck ...	that 's why you were riding with him .
this ... this is incredible . is the rest of europe like this ?	some places , not all . italy , for instance , they 're serious about their food . but try bloody britain , anywhere in the u.k. , you do n't get much fancier than a deep-fried bar egg . food 's not our thing , you see .
what is ?	best beer in the world known to man or god .
best beer in the world ? budweiser for me , thanks .	budweiser ? you talk to me of beer and you 've the unbridled gall to mention budweiser in the same sentence ? that 's not beer ! christ , it 's not even a poor excuse for rabbit piss .
oh yeah ? whatta you drink , then ?	i drink what every civilized man , woman and child in the world drinks : guinness .
when we 're done with this , i want to do for that one myself .	now there 's the deirdre i know .
and what 's that supposed to mean , seamus reilly ?	it means i was worried that all the time you spent away from the fold might have affected you . you 've been living the life of the hired gun -- the well paid hired gun , i might note . there 's no glory to it , but there are those that like it .
so you thought that maybe i 'd grown too attached to this charade i 've been playing , is that it ?	it 's been known to happen .
not to me , you know that .	i thought i did .
problem my ass ! i think you 're lying to me , and if you are you 're a dead man !	would somebody tell me what fucking well happened in there ?
what in bloody hell is going on ?	they 're part of the team . one of them 's the guy i told you about .
from interpol ?	that 's him .
lose them !	you lose them !
about time !	not yet ...
good christ ! ca n't you lose these jokers ?	they 're good !
you better be careful , seamus , before something happens a plastic surgeon ca n't fix .	plastic fucking surgeon ? you think i 'm going to fix this , deirdre lass ? it 's the mark of the patriot , and i 'll wear it like a badge . as for those who done it to me , i 'll take my pound of flesh before this is all over .
you 're thinking with your gun , seamus , and not your head ...	shut up ! ! ! shut up and drive ! i 'm your superior officer and you will do as i goddamn well say , is that understood ? ! ?
do i need to repeat myself ?	no , seamus . i heard you the first time .
sam . i 'm a weapons guy .	you were a soldier , were you ?
hazard pay ...	the two of you were supposed to go to a simple meet and come back with a simple piece of information , and instead you went to fucking war ...
i feel as if i 've wandered onto the set of enter the dragon . could you teach me to do that ?	i did n't think to see you again tonight . you were pretty pissed .
i still am .	is that right ?
part of me says i should just look at this as a perk . you know , a bonus . but then i remember you 're you -- deirdre who used to belong to the ira -- and it occurs to me that deceit and subterfuge come very naturally to you .	nobody 's saying they do n't .
and when i consider that , i have to wonder if you do n't have some ulterior motive for being here , with me , right now .	i probably do . but for the time being , i 'm willing to forget about it ...
look , sam , do n't take it the wrong way when i tell you we wo n't be doing this again .	you do n't have to explain yourself to me , deirdre .
i know i do n't have to , sam , it 's just that , for once , i want to . when i was a - patriot , it was a given i 'd sleep with any man it was deemed necessary for me to sleep with . you know : any man who needed setting up . sometimes so we might blackmail him , sometimes so he could be killed . sometimes so i could kill him myself . ira is n't exactly an enlightened feminist organization , sam . to most of the men i with i was always the girl . `` send the girl to do it . '' `` tell the girl to take care of it . '' `` have the girl fuck him . '' but i look at you and i get this feeling you take me for what i am : no more , no less .	you 're a hired gun , deirdre -- just like me .
i better be getting that .	duty calls ?
now , what did we steal ?	i do n't know ... well i do n't ! it 's a goddamned mystery to me just like it is to you . but i do know who we 're working for . my people , and the russian mob .
because if they had she 'd be gone along with the package , instead of sitting here with us .	exactly . gregor , he was the russian 's man . it was my people came up with the idea for this run , but the russians who had the capital to finance it . gregor , he was their insurance , and i was ours . everybody else was supposed to be neutral . gregor must 've got to swede ...
i bought it for him -- all the stuff he was using , it was in his contract . cost a nice penny , too , especially that goddamned phone : gregor had expensive tastes .	check this out . gregor 's a spook , or he was one until recently . when he was a spy he lived the life -- you know , a prince in some eastern bloc country where nobody had shit and gregor had everything . then the wall goes down . no more cold war . and gregor is out of a job . no apartment , no special stores with western food and video tapes . i would bet dollars against shit that gregor liked that phone and he does n't want to give it up . and i would n't be surprised if he 's arrogant enough to think ...
well , if it is n't mr. interpol himself . i ca n't believe i misjudged you like i did .	oh please..you 're on some sort of holy mission ?
i 'm a patriate .	do n't even think that i 'm buying that .
where do you get off saying word one ? all the time pretending to be one of us , it 's the same thing we were doing , seamus and myself . and here you are so high and mighty , like you 're so different from the rest of us .	i did n't say i was .
are you alright ?	alright ? it 's bloody fucking freezing in here !
not me . you work too often with the same people and you become friends -- clouds your judgement .	come off it , sam -- if we were n't friends already we would n't be here now , would we ?
who are you ? ira ?	not likely . once , yeah , i was -- but there was n't an inch of profit in it , and i 'm a cash oriented girl , if you take my meaning . i 'm a hired gun , same as the rest of you , and that 's all any of us needs to know about the other .
from here on in you want something you pay cash for it : no credit cards , no bank accounts are in place : ten percent up front , the rest when the job is done . you . what do you do and what should we call you ?	these days they they call me gregor -- and i 'm a tech . i do electronic work , surveillance , computer runs .
it 's quite satifactory .	good , because it cost enough . there 's cheaper phones by far than that one , man : you better fucking use it .
i intend to . this phone is wired like no other : it 's got an encryption chip and instant sat-a-link recognition , it can talk to any computer in any language and make it understand . with my custom hardware and this phone i can trace the target 's cell phone signature and follow him anywhere he goes ...	you sure about this ?
i 'd stake my reputation .	but would you stake your life , that 's the question ...
now then , let 's run through it one more time , shall we ? what 's your job ?	i use my cell phone to get computer access to the telecommunications satellite used by our target . i trace his cell phone signature and use it to pin point his location as he moves through nice , relaying that information to you .
alright , gregor , i 'm ...	ready when you are ...
where 's the case ?	there 's a problem ...
that fucking figures ...	should any of you decide to rush me , i 'll kill myself and whoever happens to be near me at the time .
go ahead , shoot ... shoot and kill the bitch , i do n't care . and yet you do n't shoot . interesting . put down your weapon and walk away .	do n't do it , sam !
shut up !	he 'll kill me anway , sam , shoot though me and kill this fucker .
yes , gregor , they sent me .	i 'm touched , really , that they 'd send someone of your caliber . it 's nice to know that they did n't make the mistake of underestimating me twice .
that was a mistake , trying to kill you . mikhi did it without consulting me , i 'd have never allowed it .	i 'm sure . but i 'm sorry to say that it 's too late for trust : we have a serious problem .
we 'll double your price .	really ? do you have the money with you ?
do you have the material ?	you first , edvard .
perhaps we could both go at the same time ...	i think not . after you ...
do you have it ?	not so fast . who 's that ?
he 's company .	bad company ...
what do you mean ?	he 's a cop , vincent , he 's french and he 's a cop and you better shoot him in the fucking head right now !
here 's yours .	there 's been a slight problem .
if you say a word in english , vincent , my friend with the high powered sporting rifle will shoot you in the throat . sorry to screw you over like this , but the information you want might get me killed if i give it to you , and that 's a price i 'm not willing to pay .	i take it you still want the money ...
where 's my information ?	in here ...
sit , sit ... would you like one ?	no , mikhi , i would n't . since i wo n't speak your language , and you ca n't speak mine , english will do nicely .
whatever you wish ... this has all been a terrible mistake , gregor . i wanted to play straight with you , but edvard insisted we try and kill you .	edvard said the same thing about you before he died .
i 'm shocked , shocked to think that you 'd believe him .	enough !
and more importantly --	i 'll destroy whatever 's in the case .
we 'll die if we stay here !	you 'll die if you leave here .
if you 're lying to me you poor excuse for a human being , i 'm gon na blow your brains all over this car .	i swear , it has to come here ! it has to ...
this better be the real thing or you 're a dead man !	it is , i 'm telling you it is ! !
what am i doing here ? why , i 'm here to see my partners , gregor , the boys in the russian mafia . see , your bosses had hoped to screw me by hiring you to pull your thieving double cross . but they only just found out that what 's in the briefcase is completely useless without me . i ca n't fight them , and they ca n't kill me -- that means we 're gon na have to do business together .	but you hate each other !
so , you 've got it all figured , do you ?	figured enough to know there 's an odd man out and i 'm looking at him .
whoever hired us .	i got this gig through a contractor . and he most definitely did n't know who was doing the hiring , only that they were paying a lot of money ...
so none of us knows who 's paying the freight , this is just some anonymous job . for all we know , we 're working for different people .	now that is an interesting proposition .
do n't talk to me unless you tell me what i want to hear , understand ? ! ? you have no choice in this , do n't think about winning , think about staying alive . i want the item , and if you do n't give it to me , i 'm gon na kill you .	i do n't have it with me ...
bullshit !	i swear ...
then where is it ?	i sent it to myself in paris .
sent it where ?	a post office box .
is it done ?	it 's done .
gregor , is that you ?	much to your disappointment , no doubt .
it was a mistake , it should n't have happened .	i 'm in the middle of saving you people a great deal of money -- the least you could do is have the decency to pay me !
so what do we do ?	what i do is none of your concern . what you should do is wait for my next phone call . i 'm going to find a place where i can tilt the field in my favor . when i 'm ready , i 'll call you and tell you what i want you to do .
how so ?	because if there 's more than one party involved , if we really are working for different people , then perhaps some of us are on different sides . your orders might be different from mine .
i would imagine that the great satisfaction in all of this will be killing the american .	i had n't thought about it . understand me , gregor -- i take no pleasure in killing . it does n't bother me one bit , but i do n't get off on it .
a means to an end , is that it ?	that 's it .
then i guess we 're set .	there is one other thing ...
what are you doing ?	do n't cross me ...
nobody 's going to do that !	really ?
i need you , swede , i ca n't do this without you !	i just wanted to make sure you knew who you were dealing with .
hello , jean-pierre .	hello , my friend . he does n't look french to me , vincent .
he 's tough , your american friend .	yes , sam 's tough alright .
and you respect him .	of course . do n't you ?
i 've never seen a man who could have taken what he just went through . he 's a cop ?	not exactly .
not exactly ? but close enough , eh ? so he saved your life , then ?	how did you know ?
american .	well , vincent 's american friend , shall we see what we can do for you ?
are you sure you wo n't have a drink ?	no booze ... pain 's in the mind , and the mind i can control . alright , let 's do it .
you think you can stitch me up on you own ?	do n't worry , we 'll take care of it .
some , thanks . enough to move on , for now .	you should really let a doctor look at that .
soon .	but first you have something to take care of ?
yeah .	something important ? a thing that can not wait ?
it gets done now or not at all . another couple of days and the parties concerned are gone where i ca n't get them .	forgive my intrusion into your affairs , but i am the one who connected vincent to this job , his agent , if you will . he is one of my oldest friends and i owe him a great debt , much like the debt i suspect he owes you .
he sees this differently , as you well know .	i did n't expect that he would .
you suffered through an agonizing pain last night , pain you could have avoided by declaring yourself an agent of the law .	vincent told you that i 'm a cop ?
so this is what , a test ?	call it a reckoning of character .
if i was healthy , i could take that away from you .	perhaps . but you are not healthy , and if you try i 'll kill you .
so what is it you want to know ?	i suppose i want to know how a man like you is created .
created ?	perhaps forged is a better word . like steel . like a sword . you 're a modern samurai . i 've spent my life around extraordinary men -- men like vincent . but i 've never seen anyone like you . i 'm afraid vincent will die if he goes with you .
vincent 's life is his own burden ; he 'll have to carry it for himself . and i 'm not any kind of samurai .	you seem one to me .
the point remains : we could be working for different people . there 's a chance for one of us ... maybe more than one of us -- has been paid to cross the others . i do n't know about you guys , but i like to know who i 'm working for . it can help prevent a great deal of ... ... unpleasantness .	anybody tries to unpleasant me i 'll put two between his eyes -- one to do the job and the other to make sure it takes .
you shoot alright .	gets the job done .
all in the stomach , though . your man might live .	not for long .
long enough to shoot back .	is that right ?
it 's been known to happen .	why do n't you go do better , then ...
yeah , well ... my way works too .	my way is better .
it 's a cocktail . mostly demerol , cut with a little crank because we might need you awake in the real near future .	fine with fucking me , we got work to do . i do n't care what it takes , we are getting our property back and putting it into the hands of the people who are gon na pay us a great deal of money when we do . i do n't know about the rest of you guys , but i 'm not the kind of guy to just sit back and take it in the ass . i do n't mean that in , like , a literal way ...
what are you gon na do , call him up and ask him to give us back our shit ?	did he bring that with him ?
what 're you talking about , man ? i do n't understand .	what a surprise ...
they call me swede .	who 's they ?
you should watch what you eat .	who the fuck died and appointed you food czar ?
i 'm just worried about your health , larry . you could stand to shed a few pounds .	and you could stand to get a little smarter , ai n't that right you dumb blonde fuck ?
i ride with fat-boy ...	eat shit and die slowly ...
after we stop the target car i get out and use the heavy artillery to kill the driver and his bodyguard .	i blast the lead car into oblivion ...
where is this broad ?	you should learn a little patience .
is that right ?	it 's consider a virtue in some corners of the world .
i do n't particularly like killing , tubby , but i want you to know that this one i 'm going to enjoy .	i do n't think so .
sorry i 'm late ...	what makes you think we 're here to meet you ?
perhaps the police ?	i know cops -- and you 're no cop .
cigarette ?	no thanks .
he trusts you to lock up ?	let 's just say he knows who i am .
i 'm vincent . and i coordinate .	coordinate what ?
where to ?	to see a man about a thing .
pretty much what you 'd expect .	that 's what i thought .
he says this is their block .	as in , they own it ?
something like that ...	and i suppose he 's saying that we oughta give them something for using it , huh ?
i did n't know that you spoke french .	i do n't . but the language he 's speaking is universal .
what 'd you say to him ?	i asked if we could give him anything else .
that was a nice move you did on our young friend . judo ?	jujitsu .
same thing , is n't it ?	not at all . similar , but not the same .
what 's the difference ?	one 's a lot more painful than the other .
help yourself . since when do you smoke ?	i have , i do n't know , maybe a cigarette a week .
a cigarette ? as in one ? one cigarette a week , who smokes like that ?	i do .
christ , i smoke a pack-and-a-half a day , and i tell myself i could be worse . it 's just so damned pleasurable .	it has it 's moments . course , you get cancer and die , that 's the down side .
so , vincent : why bring me along for the ride ? job like this calls for a warm body , somebody who can stand around and look threatening . a tough guy .	like larry or swede .
exactly . why not bring them ?	let 's just say i thought the conversational possibilities were limited . of course , i might have brought gregor , but he did n't seem like the right candidate -- for this .
watch that one , he 's an ex-spook for sure , maybe stasi , maybe kgb . he 's smart , gregor is .	so is the woman .
deirdre ? smart , yeah , and seriously goddamned dangerous .	i wonder if she truly left the ira .
i 've wondered that myself . none of this answers my question , though ... why bring me ?	i wanted to see who you were .
you were once some kind of special forces . airborne ranger , maybe a navy seal . after that you rode shotgun for the cia in some place like el salvador or afghanistan , a real mercenary . only now -- now you 're like the rest of us , it 's a very competitive market since the end of the cold war . there 's a lot of hired guns out here , and not nearly enough work to go around .	that 's right : there 's not hardly enough work these days , nothing that pays the big money , anyhow . then along comes this job , paying so much goddamned money i could n't afford not to take it . somebody 's paying through the nose for this .
they certainly are . whatever it is we 're going to steal , it must be quite something .	whatever it is it must be goddamned priceless .
lovely , is n't it ?	they 'd have to keep something like this under lock and key in new york , and it would still get fucked up .
what 's going on ?	i just wanted to see something .
i needed to know .	you need to know a lot of shit , vincent .
you know , what you pulled back there , that was bullshit .	i needed to see if you were a cop . i 'm a popular man with the police , sam , and whenever they try to catch me they always do it with an inside guy -- some man on some job who seems more trustworthy than all the others put together . and that 's the guy you have to watch out for . i hate cops ...
how did you know ?	know what ?
that there was a gun pointed at me .	i saw you look off when francois nodded his head . i figured he was n't pointing out a particularly rare shrub , and the rest was easy .
but how did you know i would have the presence of mind to pull my weapon when i did ?	because that 's what i would have done ...
the question still remains : what do we do now ?	gregor 's cell phone ...
what 's going on ?	you were n't around when i woke up , i thought maybe something had happened . this has been one very fucked up job , sam , and i 'm not taking any more chances on anybody ... including you ...
i came up here to sneak a smoke .	you were smoking ?
i hope you do n't mind i took your pack . it was on the table .	please , help yourself . smoke as many you 'd like .
i borrowed that , too ...	of course ... whenever you feel like it just help yourself .
it was at that .	a lot of people died .
i 've seen a lot of people die before .	i have n't . not like that . how do you get used to it ?
you do n't . you just learn to live with it .	i wo n't lie -- there have been times when i had to do it , times when the only way to get out alive was to see that the other man did n't .
we live in a singular world , my friend .	i never really thought i was part of the world you move in , sam , to tell you the truth . i 'm a hood , a thief . big time in a small time king of way . to the local police i 'm a prize , to the local hoods i 'm a legend . but to a guy like you i 'm just another two bit hired gun .
he 's going back .	not necessarily . he could go off road at any number of places . he might not even be in the country anymore .
you 're a cop ... you 're a fucking cop ... i should kill you .	but you ca n't .
that makes twice now you 've saved my life .	i did n't save your life back there . risked it , maybe -- but i did n't save shit .
you see it your way , i 'll see it mine . you need a doctor .	you know one around here ? somebody you trust ?
no ... i thought i 'd take you to the hospital .	no hospitals . i 'll fix this myself if i have to .
fix it yourself ? why are we even doing this ? there 's no need to run , christ ... you 're a cop .	not exactly .
you 're with interpol -- you 're a cop .	if i was a cop , a real cop , i 'd have busted you a long time ago . this is n't about you , it 's about the job i have to do .
and what job is that ?	my job , vincent , a job you do n't need to know about . i ca n't go to the local cops -- they 'd never be able to get close enough at this point . it 's me or nobody , and i 've been on this job too goddamned long not to finish .
it looks to me like we 're all that 's left of our group .	we ? there is no we in my world now , vincent , just me .
i 'm going with you .	this does n't involve you , do n't you understand ? i ca n't even guarantee you any money out of all this .
it is n't about money for me , not anymore .	you do n't have to do this .
alright , it 's done .	you see the bullet ?
clearly .	good . now take the forceps , and remember , vincent , what we 're doing here is routine . i 've done stuff like this at least twenty times in the field . there are no vital organs where you 're working , no major muscles or arteries -- you ca n't kill me . just make sure you 've got the bullet before you try to pull it out .
you know him ?	i know of him .
the irish representative ?	yes .
what 's this ?	the address of the russian production company . just in case we need to find them .
you sure your friend got the right place ?	if tony says this is it , then it 's it .
tell me , sam : why do you do this ?	do what ?
continue when it would be so much easier to give it up .	it 's my job .
then quit . you do n't work for interpol , sam .	sure i do . you heard him , you heard the guy -- that 's what he said , what edvard said .
i 'm a field agent -- last of an already extinct breed . i do dark ops .	dark ops ?
dark operations . wet work . kidnaping . assassination .	very ugly .
it is at that .	not very zen of you , huh ? not so much the modern samurai after all .
i never made that claim .	i know . jean-pierre did .
you were behind the door ?	i was waiting to see what would happen . i did n't want to kill him if i did n't have to .
you would have done that ?	i would have tried not to . but yes , if it would have kept him from shooting you , i would have .
how could you have done that ?	because i owe you . look at that ...
they do n't have the package .	you think ?
what the fuck happened ?	i do n't know ...
give me a cigarette .	right now ?
gim me a goddamn cigarette ! ! ! !	why are you driving ? you 're not french , you do n't live here , you do n't know these roads . why are you driving ?
i 'm not here very much .	business keeps you on the road ?
i know i do n't need to say this to you , but i need to say it to you . this is my job , i have to do it .	so i do it .
no you do n't , and you know it .	if our positions were reversed , would you leave me ?
in a minute .	i think not .
do we need anything else ?	yeah . we need out fucking heads examined .
not here . they might see it .	if i 'm going to die for the cia , i 'm going to go out smoking . besides , there 's half a forest between us and them , they ca n't see a goddamned thing .
time to quit .	just like that ?
not just like that ... just before i turn around and it 's six months from now and the first thing i do when i wake up in the morning is light a cigarette .	what of it ? samurai pain in the ass .
would you stop with that ...	why ? you 've got more force of will than anyone i 've ever seen . you handle a gun like it 's a part of you , you perform surgery on yourself without anesthesia ... and most amazing of all , you quit smoking , just like that .
the mark of a true samurai . what i do for the company , vincent , is no different than what you do . we 're both hired guns , and this is a job -- like any other job .	why then , sam , do n't you act like this is a job like any other ? surely , if you are a hired gun , you realize that some times you just have to walk away without getting what you came for .
because i do n't walk away .	why not ?
it 's the one thing i 've got left to hold onto . jean-pierre is one of your closest friends , is he not ?	closest and oldest .
and yet you would have killed him to save my life . you have a sense of honor , vincent , that i ca n't even remember anymore . i do n't know that i ever even had it to begin with . all i know to do , vincent , is to finish my job .	and when you finish ? what then ? this package , whatever it is , do you give it to the cia ? do you really think they deserve it ?
that 's a good question .	do you have a good answer ?
you have to stop doing that !	i 'll work on it ...
let 's get him out of here ...	finish the job ...
and now ...	finish it !
you son-of-a-bitch ...	what ?
you speak french .	what of it ?
`` your field dressing saved his life . '' that 's three i owe you .	you do n't owe me a goddamned thing , vincent , and you know it . you stepped in front of a bullet for me . i owe you a heavy debt .
i know .	you better get some sleep , alright ?
tell me something first . the package : what was it ?	i do n't know . nobody knows , except a bunch of people who are too dead to tell us . there 's probably a couple of guys back at the company who know , but i do n't think they plan to tell me anytime soon .
what happened to it ?	gone . destroyed .
i told you , i quit .	just to keep me company , sam -- i hate smoking alone . how about you ? i thought all you ira types smoked .
what 's the story ?	it 's an international thing . several different peoples involved , criminals from all over the world , experts brought together to do a job . but maybe the most interesting thing about it is that preeminent in the plot we find the russian mob and the ira in bed together . an unlikely group of partners .
gaelic .	you sure ?
why 's that ?	cause the russian production company would be easier to find .
it 's the irish tape we want .	gon na be tough .
last i heard there was a film rep for the irish players staying at this address , name of seamus reilly .	seamus reilly .
why did n't you kill her ?	why did n't you kill him ?
you slept with her !	how is it these fellahs managed to get the drop on us ?
you slept with her !	you should have kill him when you had the chance . but no ...
you put everything on the line because you ...	you slept with the fucker ! !
my man , how you doing ?	i 'm alright . and you ?
doing well . this is ?	a friend . i was telling him about how you always have the latest tapes .
i was wondering if you had any movies that were particularly new .	matter of face there 's this flick i 've been hearing about . i have n't seen it , but from what i hear it 's pretty cool .
do you have the tape ?	i might know where you could get a copy .
what i 've heard so far , it 's all a lot of talk . i was n't so sure what to make of it at first , cause , like i said , the irish and the russians are an unlikely mix .	you said you might know where we can get a copy of this tape ?
can you get it ?	the russian would be easier .
seamus reilly , boy 's a serious irish auteur -- a real firebrand . thinks his more moderate filmmaking brethren have turned to making movies for peace-loving pussies , if you see what i 'm saying .	i get the picture .
tony and i have to talk some business , first .	i got ta try and overcharge him , he has to moan about the price , we settle somewhere in the middle .
sort of !	hey dwayne why do n't you introduce him to your funeral parlor cousin ?
what the hell happened here ?	looks like some kind of drug deal or something , they 're not from around here -- one of them 's still alive .
i 'd like to know what they were doing in my town ! did you get id off any of them ?	none of them had any --
damn .	i want to get some hounds down here .
whatsamatter with you ? are n't you concerned about all of this ?	i ca n't get enough of it .
i should kill you right here ! i never thought you 'd do this to me but i guess there 's a lot i did n't know about you !	dwayne listen to me -
shut up ! not another word out of you ! you 're going down , the feds know all about it ! you did n't know some of it was marked , did you ! where 's the rest ?	i do n't know what you 're -
ready to roll , partner ?	sure thing , and --
do n't spend it all in one place .	i knew you 'd come through . jesse observes the transaction booth and earl start to leave .
how old is otis anyhow , thirty ?	the horniest dog in nevada .
thanks for the loan , man . i 'll have it in a few days , i promise .	well i hope so . that pretty much cleaned me out .
i would have asked my sister , but its better to leave family out , always leads to trouble .	i hear you .
yeah ... i remember my brother-in-law gary , the wheel watcher . he finally got on the show and won seven thousand dollars ! plus some leather furniture . do you think i saw any of that ? his excuse was the government got it all .	seven thousand ...
he would have won more but he blew it at the end . did n't know what cash and carry was .	cash and what ?
cash and carry , you know , fdr , world war two ...	never heard of it .
oh , you would have done great .	i probably would have . i guess the clues damn near before everyone .
what the hell ...	they 're out of towners ... arizona plates ...
ten thousand right here .	there must be over a million dollars in here .
what are we going to do ?	what do you mean what are we going to do ?
call it in i guess . why ?	why ? are you kidding me ?
no . we ca n't .	look around you partner ! you said yourself you never saw anything like it .
we do n't know whose money it is ! they might have robbed a bank , who knows ?	robbed a bank , c'mon ! do n't you think we would have heard if one , two -- shit i do n't know how many were at large ! do n't you think there would be a bulletin ? this is a big ass drug deal !
we do n't know that .	come on booth ! look at these scumbags around us . who 's going to know what happened ! let 's take it and get out of here !
well someone 's gon na find them .	hell , it wo n't be us !
it wo n't work .	why ?
i told trudy we were coming down this way , that 's why !	we 'll figure something out .
we would never have to worry about money -- ever again , jesus !	suppose someone knows about the money ? they 're bound to ask questions .
who 's going to question us ? dwayne ? jesse ?	it 's going to go bigger than that . could you stare someone straight in the face and lie about it ?
i 'll worry about that when it happens and if it happens , and it 's not gon na happen !	what makes you so sure ?
it 's no accident we stumbled on this money . it 's an answer to a prayer ! every night and every day i 've prayed that god would just -- help me out a little , give me a little push . tonight my prayer came true .	oh so god 's like western union and he just dropped us a couple million bucks ?
that 's right !	at the expense of six people .
all right hold on ! lem me think ... shit , did you touch the car ?	maybe . who cares ?
i do . it 's little shit like that sends people to jail ! we have to cover all the bases if we 're going to pull this !	all right we will .
we 'll torch the bases , how 's that ?	torch it ? !
we 'll leave a few packets in the trunk , and stash the rest somewhere else . car went up in the gunfight .	i do n't know .
i 've got one condition .	what 's that ?
we 're going to be patient . if we start flashing money around , buying fancy cars and fancy clothes , people are going to ask questions .	well , we wo n't do any of that shit !
shhh !	what are you gon na do ?
i do n't know ! son of a bitch ! who the hell are you ?	he saw everything !
how long you been lying there playing possum with us , huh ? answer me !	he 'll tell them everything to save his ass . that 's how they all work it !
i 'm not letting some gangbanger send me to jail . we ca n't risk it .	what are you thinking ?
i do n't know ...	you 're thinking about killing him . i ca n't do that . no way . i 've never killed a man . never even shot at one ...
well neither have i , but it 's us or him . if he talks , or writes a note , or whatever , he 's gon na turn us in . besides , he 's a low life scumbag . his kind is hardly even human anyway .	i ... i ca n't do that .
okay then . i 'll do it .	that 's not what i mean .
i tell you it was a miracle the way things turned out --	i do n't want to hear about miracles and god and all that ! we tried to murder someone to cover our asses !
look . dwayne was right . this is going to be a big story . so big in fact that i do n't want to even have this money around .	fair enough , i 'll take it to my place .
we 're dead . we 're dead , we are dead ... what are we going to do ? !	i do n't know ...
i do n't know you want me to put on my cape and fly there ? ! we 're going to play it cool ... besides there might be nothing on that tape anyway ...	that guy was a federal agent . an officer of the law , just like us .
well , we did n't know that at the time .	we assaulted a federal agent . we killed him .
no we did n't . he died on his own .	oh , right , with a little help from his pals booth and earl . i 'm sure that 's gon na fly real far when they hear that tape ...
we got ta turn ourselves in , before they hear the tape .	are you nuts ? they 'll fry us for sure . there 's no way we 're doin ' that , you understand ? no way .
it 's the right thing to do .	it 's the stupid thing to do , that 's what it is .
i should have known something like this was going to happen !	man take it easy ! you 're sweating like crazy !
how long you been lying there playing possum with us , huh ? answer me !	he 'll tell them everything to save his ass . that 's how they all work it !
shit ! we 're gon na have to get rid of him . i 'm not letting some gangbanger ruin my life . we ca n't risk it .	what are you thinking ?
you 're thinking about killing him . i ca n't do that . no way . i 've never killed a man . never even shot at one .	well neither have i , but it 's us or him . if he talks , or writes a note or whatever , he 's gon na turn us in . besides , he 's just a low life scumbag . his kind is hardly even human anyway .
i ca n't do that .	okay then . i 'll do it .
that 's not what i mean .	listen . do you want to go to jail ? taking evidence , tampering with a crime scene . you know what they 'd do .
he would have done it to us , right ?	exactly . this is our little secret , partner .
i could kill that no good son of a bitch !	all right enough ! i 'm tired of thinking about all this !
well i 'm not ! thinks he 's got us by the balls .	well does n't he ? besides if the dea heard that tape we 'd be behind bars right now . just call it the cost of doing business . this whole thing is screwed up . i 'm thinking . maybe we should tell 'em the truth ...
... or get rid of the money . i do n't know .	i 've got a better idea . all we have to do is straighten out jesse .
and how do you figure we do that ?	all we have to do is get our hands on the original tape . we 'll set him up somehow .
he 's probably made copies . he 's not going to give them up to us .	forget the copies ! he could have made up the copies -- the only thing that incriminates us is the original .
he 's going to be trouble .	he 's a partner now , earl , like it or not .
we had a deal ! what was i , talking to the wall ?	for christ 's sake , booth , i just needed to take care of a few debts is all ! you got my word on it -- i 'm not going near it again until everything cools down .
you said that last time !	well i mean it this time . come on . let 's get this over with !
you 're out of your mind .	yeah , i mean you 're coming unglued , jesse .
you think he 's bluffing ?	no .
look , earl . we got ta go straight . this is all messed up ...	if you 're any friend at all , you 'll stop talking like that !
maybe we can reason with jesse , give him a third in exchange for the tape .	i do n't think he 's going to be doing any bargaining with us , the stupid son-of-a-bitch ! besides , i 'm not giving him a third of anything , not after everything we had to do .
well what are we supposed to do ?	i do n't know ... we have to shut him up somehow . booth looks at earl --
you 're crazy .	how badly do you want that money ? ! how bad do you want to stay out of jail ?
not bad enough to kill him .	who said anything about killing ? just keep driving straight ...
how long is it going to take ? !	i do n't know ! shit , give me a break !
what are you thinking ? we were only supposed to scare him !	i 'm just making our intentions clear . go check the desk .
here it is .	there it is ... now what about the others ?
even if we have the tape , that would n't shut him up !	you killed him ...
it 's gon na be o.k .	like hell it is . this is jesse ! jesse !
jesus christ earl ... what are we doing ? ...	we 're doing what we got ta do , to protect ourselves !
you do n't know if he was really gon na --	yes i do ! it never woulda stopped , you know that . jesse 's always gon na be making mistakes and we 'd be paying for them for the rest of our lives .
maybe we should say somethin ' .	come on . booth grabs the bag --
do you have everything ?	i sure as hell hope so . let 's go .
i do n't know for sure , but why else would they head for the bank ?	it was all used . random numbers . how can they trace it ?
i do n't know . they got all kinds of high-tech shit nowadays .	then we 're screwed .
we 're not ? how do you figure that ?	we 'll take the money and disappear ! we can do it , spend it on the move . even if all of it 's marked , there 's ways around it .
we 've got to go now , then .	that 's right .
oh jesus ...	he killed her ... he killed her ...
what happened ? what 's earl doing here ?	he found us , he shot her ... he killed her ...
booth , listen to me ... booth !	he killed her ...
we got to get out of here . do you understand ? we got to get out of here right now !	no . it stops now . it stops here .
dwayne 's dead .	i know , i know . dwayne 's dead , but we can deal with it . we 'll pin it on him . the dea was driving jesse 's car . no car phone . no radio . they could n't have called me in .
what are you talking about ?	dwayne had the opportunity , just like us . he was at the scene . he grabbed the cash . of course . this is perfect !
it 's too late ...	it 's not too late !
you 're the one who 's nuts ! there 's no one left to touch us , booth . we 're home free ! we just plant a little of the money on dwayne , and it 's all ours .	it 's not about the money anymore . ca n't you see that ? it 's about
just one more . this one knocks off all the rest .	i ca n't . i ca n't go on . i ca n't keep lying ... killing . that 's not me . that 's not us .
that 'll bring me down , too . eventually . you got ta know that .	uh huh .
and you 're solid on that ?	rock solid .
you gentlemen look like you 're about to toss your collective cookies .	why do n't you get to the point .
listen earl . i covered for you . for both of you . i put my ass on the line to save yours , so do n't pull a hostile tone with me !	what 's your offer , jesse ?
besides , i 'm not stupid , earl . the tape was a basic maxell d-80 . you can buy 'em at any store . there 's no way they can pin anything on me .	all right , jesse , we 'll play it your way , under one condition .
i 'm all ears .	we 're going to wait . all of us , until everything dies down .
well , i do n't know ...	that 's the deal . if you do n't like it , forget it , no one wins .
ok ... i 'll wait . for now . but i 'm going to need a little advance , to oil the wheels , so to speak .	how much ?
i understand your logic , booth , but i do n't think ... two thousand 's going to raise any eyebrows , do you ?	two thousand ...
there 's going to have to be a change in our arrangement .	what are you proposing ?
i do n't like getting grilled by that dea bitch , i do n't like taking that kind of heat !	none of us like it !
well i do n't know what 's going to happen next -- she 's pressing this , another interrogation , another problem .	just take it in stride .
i was beginning to think you were n't going to show . that ca n't be all of it .	no . it 's not .
you do n't expect us to believe that do you ?	you better believe it if you know what 's good for you !
come on , booth . do n't let him do this ! ! !	do n't have much choice , jesse . you saw to that !
you 're only screwing yourselves over ! helllllp ! helllllp ! somebody ! ! !	shut up , jesse .
whoa , earl !	okay ! it 's under my desk ! ! taped to the bottom side ! ! !
how are ya ?	hello .
thank you . now , do you remember seeing any vehicles traveling near the site , on your way to or from ?	no . why ?
could it have been in the mercedes ?	maybe . that 's where it was during denning 's last report .
normally we would have tracked him with a wiretap , but it was standard for him to occasionally drop out when working with these guys . the last we heard from him was two days ago .	you mean that guy was an agent ?
well , we have one lead and that 's what i 'm looking into next .	what 's that ?
yeah ? so ?	it 's odd . i do n't know how denning had the time , or the ability to buy something local , based on his situation .
i have to go to the bank before it closes .	what for ?
there 's an atm on speedwell avenue .	yeah but i need to take out four hundred dollars and the atm will only give me three .
well , not that i would n't sugar bun but earl 's in a bind . they 're going to take his car .	he 's irresponsible .
ah hell , he 'd do the same for me .	has he ?
get a room in a nice hotel for a few hours ...	i might have to look into that ...
hi .	hi .
yeah .	it was all over the local news . dwayne was there , acting all official .
what 's wrong ?	nothing .
nothing 's wrong .	oh . you coming by tonight ?
ok .	are you sure you 're ok ?
yeah i 'm fine .	i 'm just tired is all . i 'll see you tonight ok baby ?
ok. i love you .	i love you too .
sally ? i was beginning to think he was n't gon na leave .	i 'm in here .
you got me something ? what 's the occasion ?	you deserve it is the occasion .
what happened to your cheek ? sally oh i ... nothing ...	nothing happened ?
like hell it 's over . you told me he was n't doing this anymore .	he 's not , he 's ...
that son of a bitch .	booth . do n't . it 's nothing . it 's not worth it . remember what happened the last time ?
let 's not get into this again . i know him . if you said something , he 'd take it out on me .	and i 'd take it out on him .
and i 'd end up a widow in two ways . let 's forget it . i 'll just be a little more careful next time .	there is n't gon na be a next time . we 're gon na get out of here .
you 're worth every last penny .	well , i ca n't let you down now , can i ?
i told him i bought the lingerie , as a surprise . i do n't think he suspects anything , but now you know , if he mentions it .	how the hell did he find it ?
he started digging through my closet , something he never does .	great ...
it 's ok , booth , it 's no big deal .	let 's hope so . sally if he asks me again , i 'm gon na tell him i returned it all .
dammit , i 'm so sick of this .	i know .
every night i think about you sleeping with him , him slobbering all over you .	he does n't slobber , he just snores . and i told you we have n't ... done anything in over a year .
it does n't matter ... he 's next to you . you know , i always say to myself , you should have left him years ago . why did n't you ?	i used to think he was something , once ... i was eighteen , i did n't know any better , and he had something steady to offer .
let 's just get out of here , get out of this -- place . we 'll drop out , get a house have some kids , get a satellite dish ...	i hate it when you talk like this . go on .
we 'd ... i do n't know ... go to california , new york , maybe a house on a swiss mountainside ...	it 'd have to be switzerland to make sure dwayne never finds us .
so do i .	i love you sally .
a satellite dish ?	well i was just throwing out ideas ...
how are we going to do all this ?	i 'm going to quit . that 's what has to happen first . then we 're going to tell him .
i do n't know , booth .	i 'll be there for you . he wo n't try anything while i 'm there . i promise . i 'll protect you .
when do you expect this inheritance stuff to be straightened out ?	should n't be long . a couple of weeks maybe .
can you rely on how much they said you 'd get ?	it 'll be more than enough . we can get out of here ...
why does that bother you ?	i 'm not sure why . it 's just , i 've never been anywhere else ...
sally there 's a whole world out there . we can have a new home . a real home , not some tin-plated dump . what are you giving up ?	i do n't know . my friends ...
we 'll meet new people . you might have friends out there you never met .	yeah , i guess you 're right . it 's just ... all so sudden ...
do you wan na tell me what that was all about ?	yeah . i want to tell you everything .
things just got a little screwed up , that 's all .	i do n't believe it .
sally , do you love me ?	you know i do .
yeah , i 've seen him .	what did he buy ?
i do n't remember . we get a lot of people in here .	could it have been this ?
be more specific . a month , a week ...	a week ago , at most .
test the product ?	yeah .
business is business . now where the hell is it ? i wan na get out of here . that 's the plan , we 're just flunkies , you know what i 'm saying ?	you did n't answer my question . are you saying my word is of no value to you ?
i have a better plan . you want to hear it ?	what ?
and what 's that ?	how about you give us what you have and leave .
what ?	am i speaking english here ? how-about-you-give-us-what-you- have-and-leave ?
what is this ? do n't be stupid man ...	first you question my integrity , then you call me stupid ... ... that hurts , son .
all right , deputies , take care , do n't let your meat loaf .	do n't worry the real men are in charge now .
why ?	cause we got footprints leading into that brush , i want to see where it leads ... jesus , seven dead . i 'll tell you i 've never seen carnage like this in all my seventeen years of sheriffing these parts . i do n't like it . not in my jurisdiction .
what makes you say that ?	we had hounds down at the scene , the footprint trail was a bust . and there were no other tire tracks in the vicinity .
i do n't know .	this just might be our ticket !
what do you think about all this ?	hell , i do n't know . if i had some input i 'd offer it up .
i guess we can get started .	i wanted to ask you some questions about last night .
he kept a recording of all such transactions in order to keep track of who 's who , what was said , what 's happening . i contacted your local coroner , and he found it taped to his back .	that 's news to me . so it 's over at jesse 's office ?
yeah . i told him i 'd be there before five .	excellent . i 'll go down with you .
well nothing audible to us . maybe the lab can pick something up .	damn ! martin i 'm sorry to have dragged you all the way down here for that . i thought maybe it would help . booth lets out an inaudible deep breath -- earl immediately plays up to martin , clearly relieved --
well we 'd like to help you in any way we can . we 're all in this together , as law enforcement officers .	we appreciate that .
uh , no ...	do n't you think i would have told you that !
maybe . maybe not .	what are you getting at ?
well , unfortunately denning 's not here to tell us , but i would say someone got their hands on that tape and switched it .	why would someone do that ?
oh that was agent wallace . we 're going to check into something .	maybe i should come along .
do n't you have to be here ?	hell no . besides i 'm just a radio call away if something happens . i feel i should keep abreast of what happens , seeing it 's my jurisdiction and all .
we do n't know . whoever got this payload together has one hell of a laundering system .	have you known this all along ?
well you can understand why we did n't say anything . if word got out that we had a track on the money it would only work against us .	well yes i understand that , we do n't want them high-tailing it out of here .
sheriff hogan --	dwayne .
dwayne ... it is imperative that we keep this confidential . now we know someone 's out there . very close . it may even be the son of a bitch that killed my partner .	fine . the information does n't leave this room .
ok ... this is good . our first solid lead .	did you say after midnight ?
mr. curtis called us this afternoon . the bills arrived at this branch from a cash drop . came through a store called after midnight . there 's only four employees , none of them can tell us who passed them .	is this marked money , or what ?
some of it . denning only handled a small portion of the total , but it looks like this was one of his bills .	so there was money there ! who the hell 's money is it ? !
yeah .	what the hell is that , some kind of porno store or something ?
not exactly . it 's some lingerie store on the strip .	lingerie ...
yeah , racy stuff , you know the kind , right ?	sure ... dissolve to ext hogan house -- night
hello .	hi .
anything i can help you with ?	well i just uh , you know ...
i have an anniversary coming up , thought i 'd buy her something special .	anything ... specific ?
sixty five ... jeez louise !	we are having a sale on some items over here --
yeah , she is . she comes up to about here on me .	hmmm ...
i do n't suppose you 've seen her .	have i seen her ?
shopping here ?	no , i ca n't say that i have .
let 's see ... do you know her cup size ?	uh ... c ?
c ?	yeah i 'd say c ... c .
do you know ... 34 c ? 32 c ?	no i do n't . you sure you havent seen her ?
well ... i should have done a little homework , getting all the sizes , and what not .	sure .
i 'm just not very good ... with all of this stuff .	oh , that 's ok , a lot of men feel uncomfortable when they come in here .
a lot of men come in here ?	oh yeah . between here and vegas we get a lot of customers . all types . even had an officer , just like you .
just goes to show you .	i mean at least pick a more discreet place , the scalp , under the armpit , under the tongue , someplace where the trained eye wont immediately look .
damn its hot in here ...	he probably figured she was on her way out anyhow , no drugs in her system , no foul play .
very clumsy , very clumsy . id have found it in a minute .	all right youre the super sleuth , what do you want , a medal ?
no . but what i would like is the forty dollars you owe me , and im a busy man .	dammit youre persistent . i dont want to listen to this anymore . no more bets with you .
aw , now thats gon na take time to clear !	take it or leave it .
do you even have a girlfriend , jesse ?	sort of .
she 's not his type .	yeah . that 's all i need , to become one of your in-laws .
jesse ?	yeah whaddya want ? .
i 'm at a payphone in vegas . what 's up ?	vegas ! can you hightail it back here by three o'clock ?
why ?	well , we got the dea coming down here again , i do n't know , sounds to me like they got some more questions they want to ask us .
about what ?	well they really did n't go into any details on the phone , but they did ask for you , and i figure we should try to help them out as best we can .
uh , sure . i hear you .	so be here at three .
i 'll do my best ... that does n't give me much time .	i have complete faith in you . but do n't you go speeding .
nice of you to join us . i did say three o'clock , did n't i ?	well i 'm here now .
something wrong , jesse ?	no . something wrong with you dwayne ?
you walked in here looking like you just ate a shit sandwich .	well , i just got a lot of things on my mind is all .
what 's this ?	i do n't know ...
hey where 's the hot pad ?	what ?
where 's the hot back -- the therapeutic pad thing ?	i ca n't hear a word you 're saying !
it was going to be a surprise !	a surprise huh ? well i do n't like any surprises , especially if i 'm forking over the loot for them !
what are you saying ?	i 'm saying you 're about as romantic as a bag of sand .
nothing . nothing 's the matter . sally are n't you going to tell how your day went ?	not much to tell . nothing really happened .
suppose i 'm not exciting enough for you .	i did n't say that . you did .
well you might as well say it . mister small time ...	just trying to be civil dwayne .
do n't you want to hear about my day ?	yeah let 's hear about your day .
whatever ...	look i worked all day , i 'm tired as hell and i want to sit and eat in peace ! is that asking too much ?
no , dwayne , you go ahead and relax , have a six pack and fall asleep in front of the tv , and come upstairs and pass out . and do it all over again tomorrow !	save me the sermon . i 've heard it all before , it 's boring .
you shut your mouth you son of a bitch !	dwayne put the gun down --
you 'd do this to me ? !	dwayne -
dwayne please calm down !	calm down --
hey we 're all friends , right ? friends do n't squeal on friends , that 's not what jesse segundo is all about .	then what the hell are you all about ?
i 'll settle for a third of that .	and if we refuse ? your tampering with evidence is n't exactly a misdemeanor , did you ever consider that ?
we 're out of here .	right behind you .
meet me at the tumbleweed diner .	what ?
i 'm not asking .	well you 're not getting , either .
what do you mean ? you gambled it ?	i was on a roll ! im a little overextended now .
oh jesus christ ...	so i want the money and i want it now .
you want to see how more unglued i can get ? try me .	you 're never getting that much .
what the hell are you doing , you crazy some bitches --	we 're gon na talk .
i do n't suppose you 'll tell us where the tape is .	well it 's not here -- you 're wasting your time and you 're pissing me off !
do n't hurt me .	we got ta , jesse . it 's tough , but you did n't leave us any choice . we got ta know where the tapes are .
easy to purchase , hard to detect . too much potassium can kill a man . just have to ... pick a discreet spot .	stop ! stop ! i do n't need the money . you can have it all .
hi ma .	hi .
i did n't know you were coming .	i was in the neighborhood .
is that the mail ?	yeah .
how 's work ?	well , same ol ' same ol ' .
people have been asking me about that story in the paper . i told them you were the first person on the scene . they were asking me for all the details .	it was pretty gory ma , let me tell you . but you have to turn all that off , and do your job , just like pop used to say .
did they ever find out who they were ?	nope . if you 're a criminal you do n't carry id , and if you do you 're a damn fool .
i tell you this world just keeps getting more and more violent .	at least around here it does .
are you hungry ?	yeah sure i 'll grab something before i go ... hey -- i 've got a surprise .
there was this raffle going on at the station , some charity or church was running it , i forget , so i figure what the hell put in my five bucks ...	and what happened ?
well what do you know ! an air conditioner .	and not just any air conditioner . this baby sells for over six hundred dollars retail .
that 's great earl !	yep , fifteen thousand btu 's , enough to cool off this whole place .
this whole place ?	yeah . figured you could have it .
do n't you want it ?	ah , hell i 'll get one soon enough . besides , i want you to have it .
well i do n't know --	you 've done without it long enough , ma .
thank you honey . are you sure you do n't want it ?	absolutely positively .
you want to hear the good news first , or the bad news ?	give me the bad news .
we retrieved a few things from the trunk , including a steamer trunk , or the remnants of a trunk , the brass clips and so forth .	anything in it ?
but nowhere near three million dollars worth . i would say maybe twenty thousand .	there was more than that .
not in the trunk .	that does n't tell us much . did you run a check on the gas like i told you ?
yeah , we did . it was unleaded , high octane .	so ... what 's the good news ?
that fire was set . deliberately . and probably not by anyone found at the scene .	so someone did get away .
i do n't know how else you 'd explain it . the coroner 's estimated time of death for everyone there was long before this fire started , unless of course denning started it , and that does n't make much sense .	no , it does n't . neither does his blank tape . any news on that ?
he did n't make it into work , and he 's not home .	i knew it , i knew it all along - shit !
you think he skipped town ?	we 're going to find out .
yeah .	what do you think ? heart attack ?
this is n't right ...	i 'm not getting an answer .
is it true , carter ? are you in hong kong right now ?	hong kong ? i 'm not in hong kong . i 'm in hollywood -- right at sunset and vine , two minutes from the station . how about i pick you up right now and take you to dinner ?
it 's nine-thirty in the morning .	did i say dinner ? i meant diner . biscuits and gravy , you love that shit .
do you know what happened yesterday , carter ? i was officially nominated for the commissioner 's post for the lapd . there was a dinner last night , two hundred lapd officers were there .	two hundred cops ? was mario sanchez there ? he owes me money .
i 've waited my whole life for this job , but i do n't have a shot in hell of getting it . do you know why ?	is it because of the hookers , sir ? you tell them there 's no crime in being lonely .
no , carter . the reason i 'm screwed is because the entire department is about to find out the stolen credit cards we impounded were used to buy two first class upgrades to hong kong . and what the hell is heaven on earth ?	sir , i 'm working on a big case over here -- and by the time i get back they 're gon na make you governor . captain , you there ? hello ? shit !
what the hell is that ?	those are five hundred dollar chips .
did you give me five-hundred dollar chips because i 'm black ?	no , i just assumed ...
you assumed a brother coming in here can only afford five-hundred dollars a roll , is that right ? are you a racist ?	no , sir .
winner six !	how much is that ?
two-hundred thousand !	two-hundred thousand dollars ? who wants a hundred dollars ?
winner ! four , winner !	i 'm up a hundred and fifty-grand . that 's a ferrari . do they sell those here in the gift shop ? somebody cash me out !
invitation , please .	i 'm with the band . i 'm the lead singer .
the band has been playing over an hour .	i got held up at a wedding in tai koo . ricky here yet , i need to get his requests .
wait .	last party all he wanted was sting -- not one person danced . tonight i 'm doing superfreak , i do n't care what he says . where is he ?
hear you got your ass kicked in hong kong , james .	what ? ? where 'd you hear that ?
i got my sources .	and i got mine , meaning you . nice how that works out . i 'm serious this time , i 'm closing this place down .
james , you see my kids back there ? you know how much i 'm paying for private school ? how can you come in here with this attitude , you being little chang 's godfather ?	little chang is gon na have to go visit his daddy in jail if you do n't cooperate .
jail ! ? james , you better back off . badge or no badge , i 'll kick your ass .	i 'd like to see you try .
look , i need some info and i do n't have time to play around .	is this about the funny money ?
how 'd you know ?	you 've been asking loud questions in all the wrong places all morning . how come you always save me for last , james ? when are you gon na learn . shit do n't happen i do n't know about .
so tell me what you know .	i know teddy wu is cranking out a pretty good double sawbuck -- but you knew that too , did n't you ?
what ?	one of my regulars lost fifty thousand dollars at the table here last week . i was about to send my boys down to tune his ass up , when the guy comes in and pays off the whole thing . including the vig -- brand new sequential hundred dollar bills . i knew something was wrong . cause this guy 's got a regular job , no way he comes up with fifty grand in cash . but i tested the bills , infrared . the whole thing . and they checked out . 100 % .
i knew it . the guy 's name is zing . he works at the kitchen at reign plaza .	all right , kenny . thanks . you 're off the hook . for now .
how you doing , baby ? my name is prince mubutu from nigeria .	isabella molina , from san juan . that seat is taken .
san juan ! you must know my good friend pedro martinez hernandez hector elizondo .	i do n't think so .
i 'm sorry , you looked like you traveled in the best circles . but hey , i understand . make yourself at home , isabella . champagne , caviar , whatever you want . my ship is your ship .	this is your ship ?
that 's right . i 'm the owner , the captain -- you can call me el capitan .	el capitan ?
i do n't want to play games with you , isabella . i like you . i can see myself with you -- in one of those bathrooms over there in about five minutes .	well , i 'm very tempted . it 's such a beautiful yacht . what 's it called ?
called ? what 's my ship called ? well ... it 's called the s.s. minnow johnson .	the s.s. minow johnson . funny , the name on the back was `` red dragon . ''
red dragon ? you sure about that ?	i 'm sure , because this is my friend 's yacht . and it 's his party .
you see , no bomb . now stay away before i throw you both in jail for obstruction .	throw us in jail ? i 'm about to bust you right now .
i 'm an undercover agent for the united states secret service .	how do we know you 're not lying ? let me see your badge .
yeah , that 's right .	we need to get out of sight . come down to my suite .
look , i 've been working this case for months now ...	so what 's your story ?
it 's a myth . some kind of counterfeit .	it 's much more than a counterfeit . 14 out of 15 world banks ca n't tell the difference . the paper is crane linen blend -- and the bills are printed on u.s. intaglio presses .
how 're they getting into the u.s. mint to use the presses ?	in 1959 , the united states was very friendly with the shah of iran . we wanted his oil , so for the shah 's birthday , the government gave him a gift -- a u.s. treasury intaglio press . the only one to ever leave the country . five years ago ricky tan bought that press on the black market .
they use an optical transfer ink from india that burns red -- the real ink burns black .	what the hell are they going to do with a hundred million dollars in funny money ?
i 'm busy at the moment .	i said get on your feet !
i know you , detective carter , right ? you 're lee 's american friend . enjoying your visit ?	i 'm lee 's new muscle , his right arm -- and do n't let the robe fool you . this is the only color they had left . now get up !
let 's go . i 've got girls and chicken and hot oil waiting for me .	i do n't think so ...

lem me ask you something , steven . and i want the truth . is there any way i can date your daughter ? just dinner and a movie , maybe go listen to some jazz ...	vegas has been my town for 30 years . i crawled out from under the first rock . do you really think you can intimidate me here ?
you 're right , you 're a smart guy . most counterfeiters only get ten cents on the dollar . but this is an even swap . pure genius .	you play games with me , detective , and you 'll lose every time . do n't forget . the odds are always in favor of the house .
i warned you about playing that shit when i 'm in the car .	that was my cd . do n't you ever touch a chinese man 's cd .
did you see the way those girls drove off ? i did you a favor .	those girls drove off because of you .
all i did was invite them for a drink .	you invited them to get naked and sacrifice a small goat .
you owe me a copy of the beach boys greatest hits , volume two .	do n't be giving me attitude , lee . i 've been here three days and we have n't done shit . we have n't been to a club , have n't even talked to a girl . i 'm on vacation , and i want some mu-shu .

carter , get off that stage !	are you kidding , they love me . i 'm a star , lee . a god to these people !
this is a gangster bar , we 're here undercover .	i knew you were lying .
i 'm sorry .	damn it , why are you ruining my night ? i 'm just starting to have fun . well fine then , go ahead , pull your badge and do your thing .
no , we 're here for information , to find out where a man named ricky tan is . we must tread softly and keep our ears open .	tread softly ? who taught you how to roost a bar ?
carter , you do n't understand . these men are fu-cang-long triads . part of the most deadly gang in china .	man , are you crazy ? you think that scares me ? i 'm from l.a. we invented gangs . we were having gang wars before anybody even thought about it . we get royalties from other gangs . now gim me your badge and gun and i 'll show you how it 's done .
no . you are a civilian . in china , i am michael jackson , and you are toto .	you mean tito . we had toto for dinner last night .
what 'd i say ?	you just said you 're their worst nightmare - and to line their mothers up for a milking .
all i wanted was a little mu-shu .	try to land on your feet .
you lied to me .	i 'm sorry .
you 're sorry . i got somebody 's old chopsticks stuck in my ass , so do n't tell me you 're sorry . just take me home .	no time . there was an explosion at the american embassy today -- two american translators were killed .
i 'm telling you right now , i 'm tired of this shit . there 's two billion chinese - let one of them be your partner .	this wo n't take long .
and that 's how you use the lapd choke hold . now start practicing and do n't make me come back here !	carter ... you ready to have some fun ! ?
just follow my lead and act like a tourist .	i am a tourist .
hello .	how you doin ' ?
what are you doing ?	she said i could pick any girl i want .
well , hurry up .	hey ! you do n't break in front of a black man in a buffet line .
what 's wrong ?	over there -- that 's ricky tan .
that 's ricky tan ? he 's four feet tall . i 'll go over with you right now , shake him down .	this is a very dangerous man .
i 'm a dangerous man . you 're not gon na ruin my massage because of some midget in a house coat .	i 'm calling for back up !
goddamn you got a small ass .	do n't look at my ass !
where are you going ?	back to heaven on earth . i need my damn passport back . i 'm going home .
fine . go home . who needs you .	why you mad at me ? you needed back-up , so i backed you up . i was about to take out ricky tan and those bodyguards .
stop ! i 'm sick of your bullshit !	my bullshit ? i 'm not the one who goes to a karaoke bar filled with gangsters ! i 'm not the one who goes to massage parlors to bust crime lords !
it 's my job !	you 're pathetic , man . when 's the last time you had some fun ? when 's the last time you took a night off , had a date ?
i have plenty of dates .	really ? when 's the last time you had some mu-shu let 's hear it , lee , when was it ? year of the rat ?
you would never understand my life . you 're not chinese .	and you ai n't black !
carter ?	who died ?
you .	detective yu ? never met him .
not yu . you !	who ?
do you understand the words that are coming out of my mouth ?	nobody understands the words that are coming out of your mouth .
what , leave you alone so he can cap you ?	i 'm okay , you go .
why the hell should you believe him ? he had us beat up . naked . that 's nasty shit .	remember i told you my father was a policeman ? ricky tan was his partner for ten years .
what are you gon na do about it , grasshopper ?	i 'll bitch slap you into bangkok .
give me your best shot , you flat assed mama 's boy .	do n't be talking about my mama . or my ass !
i heard your mama pulls a rickshaw .	no . she 's a school teacher .
you 're not very good at this , are you ?	good at what ?
five years ago , my father was chief inspector working a big international smuggling case .	ask me if i give a shit .
he found out his partner , tan , had been working for the triads all along . before my father could prove it , he was killed in the line of duty .	how the hell did tan get away with it ?
all the evidence against him disappeared , the smuggling case was unsolved . tan resigned and went over to the triads openly .	this is about your daddy 's death ? hell , lee , you know my father died on the job . you could have told me ... this is about more than all that , is n't it ? this is about your daddy 's last case , right ?
no , no , that would be crazy --	you thought the `` customs agents get blown up '' and `` smuggling '' and `` ricky tan '' and you put it all together and came up with a five year old case . that 's why you did n't tell me what we were doing ...
i thought you 'd think it was crazy .	it is crazy !
so are you getting on the plane or not ? !	what ?
come on , we still got time to order the kosher meal . always get the kosher meal , they bring it first .	i can not go to la ...
it sounds impossible --	you said --
you want to figure out why they killed your daddy , get on the plane .	why la ?
i should go back . ricky tan mentioned a boat in hong kong harbor ...	lee , let me introduce you to the carter theory of criminal investigation : follow the rich white man .
follow the rich white man ?	almost , but you 've got to say `` rich white man '' all run together like it 's one word .
follow the richwhiteman ...	not bad . now every crime , somewhere , has a rich white man taking his cut . every single one . now in our case , we know the rich white man is steven reign .
who ?	big hotel billionaire . he was on ricky tan 's boat ordering hu li around just before ricky got smoked .
how do you know he 's our man ?	because when the shooting started he was way too cool . see most white people , when there 's shooting , they either hide in a toilet or start screaming high pitched like `` aaaahhh ! ! ! aaaahh ! ! ! !
you sound like that all the time .	black people keep their cool when the shit goes down .
maybe . but not like asians . we never panic .	yeah , what about when godzilla was coming ? you people were screaming your asses off .
just tell me where i can find this steven reign .	the same place you find all richwhitemen . gefilte fish . lox and bagel . i love this stuff . here , try it with a smear .
yeah , that 's definitely the woman from ricky tan 's boat , and she 's staying in his suite at his hotel , i told you this would work out . they still just talking ?	he just left . kissed her on the cheek .
he 'll be back soon .	how do you know ?
carter , there 's something i have to tell you . you were right about what you said in hong kong . all i do is work . never take a day off . it 's all i have right now .	hey , i did n't mean to call you pathetic .
the truth is , i have n't had any mu-shu in six months .	you pull a muscle or something ?
my fiancee left me over the summer -- a month before our wedding .	i 'm sorry , lee . why did she leave you ?
it 's a long story .	let me guess , she could n't handle the cop thing -- never knowing if you were dead or alive . i 've seen it a million times .
no . it was my singing .	excuse me ?
she 's just standing around -- not doing much .	just do n't fall asleep . sooner or later something 's gon na happen .
slow down , baby .	what did you say ?
is it hot in here ?	hot ? i 'm freezing my ass off .
i 'm gon na go in the hall and get a bucket of ice . you want some ice ?	what 's going on ?
she 's getting undressed .	gim me the binoculars .
no . it 's not right .	gim me the binoculars or i will shoot you .
what 's she doing ?	oh , sweet glory hallelujah ...
i do n't want to hear this .	skirt just came off . she 's in black bra and panties -- victoria secret spring catalogue , page 27 -- wait a sec - there 's a tattoo on her left thigh ... it looks like snoopy .
snoopy ? i love snoopy .	she just took her hair down . now she 's going for the bra -- the clasp is in front -- she 's using both hands . you better get that ice .
wait a sec - what the hell is that between her legs ?	what ?
she 's reaching into her panties -- something is strapped to her leg . oh , god ... please do n't let it be a dick .	what is it ?
i do n't understand ?	she 's walking back towards the door .
pick it up !	it 's your turn !
wait ! there 's people down there !	there 's people up here !
get it out of here !	take it !
i would n't do that ! ! !	it 's a bomb .
let me see it again ?	we can help you . i 'm a detective in hong kong .
secret service agent carter . this is my calling , lee . give me six months and i 'll be in washington protecting a white guy .	we both know you would never take a bullet for someone else .
they do n't know that . what are they gon na do , try and shoot the president during the interview ? i 'll bet isabella can pull some strings . you saw the way she was staring at me .	she never even looked at you .
you 're just jealous 'cos the girl picked me . i 'm tall , dark and handsome , you 're third world ugly .	i am not third world ugly . women like me , they think i 'm cute . like snoopy .
are you okay ?	what 's the first thing i told you -- never trust nobody . how could you fall for that shit ? i knew she was dirty .
she saved our lives .	for how long ? face it , lee , she 's playing both sides .
look , man i 'm sorry . i know you got a thing for her .	shhh , my head hurts .
i 'm about to be killed and you `` shhh '' me ! this was n't my case , lee . ricky tan did n't kill my father , the fu-cang long are not in south central . i did n't have to help you .	why did you help me ?
i 'm not used to having a partner .	we are not partners . between your daddy , my daddy , and the beating i just took , as far as i can tell all partners get you is dead .
well we 're not friends .	you got that right . and we ai n't brothers . maybe we should just end this right here .
fine with me .	i wo n't talk to you , you do n't talk to me . we 'll die in peace .
see you in the next world .	i do n't believe in reincarnation . so i wo n't see you in the next world .
fine .	i believe in heaven . you people believe in heaven ?
yes . we have heaven .	is it the same heaven , or is it a chinese heaven ?
what 's a chinese heaven ?	i thought it might be like those five foot and under basketball leagues . they do n't let everybody in .
i think we should stop talking .	fine by me .
you thinking about that girl that dumped you ?	no .
if she was the right girl , you 'd be thinking about her .	mind your own business .
how was the sex ?	there was no sex . she was very traditional . we were waiting until we were married .
you 're kidding . no sex ? nothing ? no mu-shu ?	no mu-shu .
what about a little king pao chicken ?	no kung pao chicken . never .
steamed dumplings ?	once in a while , steamed dumplings . but only when she was drunk .
that 's rough , man . if i do n't get steamed dumplings once a week , i go crazy .	tell me the truth , carter . do you think i have a good voice ?
are you serious ?	forget it . it does n't matter .
as long as you 're asking ... i think you have a pretty good voice .	i knew it . what does she know . you want me to sing something ?
that depends . how do the fu-cang-long usually kill their victims ?	they 'll probably torture us first , shock our privates , then put two bullets in our eyes and one in the back of the head .
very nice .	it 's focus . every opponent has a weak spot . you ignore everything around you , and put all your energy into one perfect strike .
hello , benjamin .	who 's benjamin ?
benjamin franklin , he discovered electricity .	a chinese man discovered electricity .
no chinese man discovered electricity .	yes he did . he also invented the bicycle .
we 're slowing down . this must be it .	end of the line .
you 've been a good friend , james carter .	oh no you do n't . do n't you be getting corny on me , lee . i 'll kick your ass from here to compton .
you could never kick my ass . you mama 's boy .	do n't you talk about my mama . that 's more like it .
vegas ...	lee . i just got an idea how someone could launder a hundred million dollars in cash .
red dragon .	that was the name of ricky tan 's boat .
let 's go .	wait a second . we ca n't go in like this . look at this place , we got ta look fly . we got ta mac out .
what is mac out ?	follow me my asian brother .
couple ? no , you got it wrong , there 's no couple here . just two single police officers working a very dangerous case .	yes . we have lots of big men chasing us .
that looks exactly like my uncle darrell .	buddha is the symbol of luck and good fortune .
carter ... here comes the rich white man .	wait here . i 'll handle this .
lee , what the hell are you doing ?	dancing ?
dancing ? i 'm out here trying to strong arm steven reign , putting my life on the line , and you 're up here dancing with some bimbo . did she have a friend ?	it was isabella . she says the plates are in the soft count room .
isabella ? are you crazy , man ? she almost got us killed . she 's setting you up again !	no . i 'm going to find out .
i 'll go to the craps table , make a big scene . when security comes over , you make your move .	try to keep them busy for five minutes .
lee !	mmmmmm ! ! ! !
why did n't you tell me you had a bomb in your mouth ?	i did !
no you did n't !	yes i did . i said mmmmmm !
ricky tan is alive .	what ? ! ? !
you go after ricky . i got this .	carter ...
lee , wait a second . it 's not worth it , man . he 's making you do this .	it 's worth it to me .
we made it , man .	no problem .
i saw that . she kissed you , did n't she ? you played it cool , though . walking away , never looking back .	she 's going home to new york . i need some ice .
that your gate down there ?	yes .
i 'm this way . i guess this is goodbye .	i guess so . thank you , carter .
your father 's badge ? no way , man . i ca n't take this .	it 's okay . i can finally let it go .
what is this ?	about fifty grand . i won it at the tables .
no , carter . i ca n't take this .	it 's okay , i got lots more .
they owe us , man . that 's the least they can do .	this money is evidence .
i always wanted to go to madison square garden . see the knicks play .	new york city ?
first class .	the plaza hotel ?
a little mu-shu .	some kung-pao ?
i could use a little vacation .	amen to that , brother .
quite a night , inspector . ricky tan was our only bait , and now he 's gone . you finally got your revenge - at the expense of a u.s. government investigation .	what `` revenge '' is he talking about ?
i do n't know if the fu-cang-long paid you to get rid of tan , or whether it was a pure vendetta killing -- but you 're off this case . i do n't ever want to see you again , you got that ?	hey , you , secret service man , what are you --
stay out of it , carter . you 're going back to l.a .	fine with me .
i know who you are , inspector lee .	then you know i 'm not walking away from this case .
is this a payoff ?	no . it 's a sample . you guys ever heard of the superbill ?
it was n't hard to spot the fakes until this past year . then tan got hold of one of a kind swiss made hundred dollar plates -- and started making superbills .	and hu li killed him for the plates .
put your arms around me .	excuse me ?
what 's going on ?	i need your help .
last time you needed my help i ended up in the back of a truck .	i 'm undercover . i had no choice . you have to trust me .
you move well .	just trying to make it look real .
behind me is the soft count room . we 're pretty sure the plates are back there .	why do n't you go get them ?
the secret service almost busted reign at his casino in macao , but the place burned down before we could move in .	how do i know i can trust you ?
i 'm asking for real now -- will you help the secret service ?	no . but i 'll help you .
are you okay ?	i 'm fine .
i did n't know which side you were on .	now you know .
master ching taught me .	the praying mantis school , in bejing ?
what are you doing hanging out with baby duck ?	baby duck ?
do you still have the bills ?	i still have my lunch money from third grade .
lee , there was a bombing at the american embassy . two american translators were killed .	any leads ?
we think it 's ricky tan . if you do n't want to take the case , i 'll understand .	it 's my responsibility .
lee , this is special agent sterling from the united states secret service .	the secret service ? why ?
all he wanted was some mu-shu .	are you okay , lee ?
lee , we just got a call from the harbor patrol . ricky tan is throwing a little party on his boat tonight . victoria harbor . if you do n't want to ...	did you tell sterling ?
let him find out on his own . i want the hong kong police handling this .	thank you .
escort detective carter to the airport --	i 'll take him .
lee , i 've missed you , brother . i heard about the two americans , i 'm so sorry , you must be under great pressure .	you must come with me for questioning .
despite what people suspect ... what you suspect --	do n't .
... if your father were alive , i would be turning to him now . i did n't blow up the american embassy , but i believe some of my people did . my enemies are trying to frame me . there is a war going on within the triads -- and i am going to lose . my name has been written into the book of death .	the police can protect you .
nobody can protect me . i 'll make a deal with you , lee . but only iff you 'll get me out of hong kong .	tell me why they killed the customs agents .
you 're just like your father , lee . all these years hiding behind his badge . i wanted to help him , to share with him , but he was too afraid of change . when you think about it , i did n't really kill him . i just put him out of his misery .	put the plates down . it 's over .
if you reach for that gun , i 'm going to kill you .	do n't you remember ? i 'm already dead .
did n't i teach you to always arch your back ?	yes , master .
i need your help , master . i 'm seeking a man who used to train with you . he 's become a killer - the worst kind of animal .	animals kill only from hunger or fear . the man you seek is lower than a serpent . ... he kills for money .
he was the best i ever trained , you know .	ricky tan ?
a seeding spends its entire life reaching towards heaven .	i know , master , but ...
the answers you seek can be found in heaven on earth .	heaven on earth ? master , i do n't understand . a temple , where heaven is on earth ? a mountain , where earth reaches for the --
chin , you have been ordered by the ministry of public security to assist the fbi and secret service with our investigation , to provide us with whatever we need . if you have information , it belongs to us .	this is still hong kong .
two americans have been killed on united states government property -- this is our investigation .	chief inspector lee will brief your people ...
who the hell is that ?	that is ... chief inspector lee . the detective in charge of our investigation .
you do n't move , you understand ? ! you do n't move !	do i look like i 'm movin ' ? ! what you 're seeing here ? this is not movement . this is my `` still '' .
you know what a phone booth is ? !	the bomb was meant as a demonstration of our sincerity . if you want the ambassador 's daughter back alive , listen and do not talk .
lee ! it 's him !	the first drop will be made tomorrow . at twelve o'clock . the amount will be fifty million .
fifty million ! are we talkin ' united states dollars ?	in used currency . nothing bigger than a fifty .
what is your name ?	that 's cool . we 're gettin ' to know each other . this is a good thing . i 'm carter .
carter . i just want to be able to tell the ambassador who was responsible for the death of his daughter because he talked too much .	hey , that 's whacked ! i thought we was gettin ' on here !
shut up !	ok. say what it is .
i do n't know what went wrong last night , but this department could 've lost one detective and our only explosives expert .	sir , i can explain .
what you did was dangerous and completely outside policy .	i know , but --
good job .	hey , sir , it was a pleasure to preserve johnson 's ass . well ... you know what i mean .
feds asked for me ?	they asked for the best street man i had .
and that , of course , would be me .	do n't push it . you better watch your ass with these fed types . if there 's a screw-up , they wo n't think twice about burnin ' it .
ooo , there 's a chill . love that .	carter .
he stole my wheel !	this is pathetic .
he 'll be ok. russ is a tough son of a bitch .	tell me about it .
he was just doing his job .	so was i .
you talk very fast .	okay , i 'll slow down . so we go downtown and we ask you a few questions ... you know , like what 's your name ? how old are you ? you ever expose yourself in public ... shit like that .
beach boy .	you 're shittin ' me . you know the beach boys ? !

you have one of these ?	no .
you speak english !	a little .
bullshit a little . you lied to me .	i did n't say i did n't . you assumed i did n't .
it 's the same thing !	i am not responsible for your assumptions .
you 're full of shit . do you understand what i 'm saying to you ? full of shit ?	not being able to speak is not the same as not speaking . you seemed as if you liked to talk . i like to let people talk who like to talk . it makes it easier to find out how full of shit they are .
okay , fine , you 're full a shit , i 'm full a shit .	we are both full of shit .
i am afraid i do n't understand the importance of this information .	look , you want to work in this country , you got ta know this crap . okay ? we 're gon na be in some deep shit here . working the danger zone . and you need insurance . cause , you know , you might be starting some riots and shit .
-- what the hell is that ?	what ?

when a man steps in dung , it is obvious . there is no need to rub it in his face . the smell is the same .	what is that , some kind of chinese proverb ?
i worked with ambassador han and his family for ten years . he wanted me to come with them to america . if i had , this might not have happened .	do n't go there ...
i could not come . i had other responsibilities .	hey , stop . we 're just gon na wind up in some bar , drinking ' to forget all the things we shoulda done and then you 'll start singin ' beach boy songs again . then i 'll really get depressed .
i also did not come because i think i would not fit in america .	hey , everybody fits in here . look at l.a. , man . nobody 's from here . my momma 's from detroit , my dad 's from atlanta , they met in texas , got married in vegas and i was born in alabama . so where the hell am i from ? kenya ?

what are you doing here ?	well , i ai n't goin ' to china . and neither are you .
oh no .	what ?
no , it is china , my country , my history . if any of it gets damaged ...	hey , do n't worry . nothing 's gon na happen to it .
oh my god . griffin .	you know him ?
what a surprise !	fbi calls up my ass , says they need help in tokyo . like i 'm supposed to drop everything .
it 's hong kong , not tokyo . my country asked for the best . i told them that was you . now i will show you around my hood .	no shark fin , no camel hump . what you listenin ' to ?
yeah ... beautiful . what would you call that paper there ? kind of a ... robin egg blue color ?	good . that 's standard military packaging for plastique . get a look under it .
not anymore .	where 'd you get it ?
you 're killin ' me here .	carter , just because you saved my butt , does n't mean it 's yours .
last night 's as much my fault as yours . if he 's gon na put the blame on anybody --	hey , i was senior . it 's ok. this is why i get the big bucks .
hey , baby , it 's cool . captain just reassigned me to the feds .	the feds ? !
way he put it , i was the only one he thought could handle it . but you know what the worst thing is ?	no ... what ?
i could get promoted right out of here .	what 's wrong with that ?
how 'd what go ?	with the fbi . what do you think i 'm talking about ?
oh , you 're not gon na believe what they put me in charge of . they sent for the ambassador 's personal chinese investigator type . he is like the baddest asian shield they got . and i , let me repeat that , i am the man who is on the case with him . just the two of us , alone , workin ' the whole deal as a team .	they put you in charge ?
in charge . just me'n him . no interference . they do n't even want to hear from us until we 're done . i love the f.b.i . i love the f.b.i .	well ... listen , if you need any help , you know , back up , call me , ok ?
oh baby , do n't worry , i 'll call you . you can count on it .	ok. well ... make us proud . and be careful .
well.. i would n't want to be in the way .	no way in the way ! i 'm talkin ' back up , johnson . i 'm in charge ! and i need you , baby .
you got a lot of guts calling me .	yes i do . that 's all i got . guts and you , johnson . there 's no one else i can trust .
you made a fool out of me ! in front of the fbi !	listen , this ai n't about us ! it 's about a thirteen year old girl . she 's not gon na make it . unless we do something .
jesus ... what do you want ?	this whole thing is goin ' down tonight . i need to know where the ambassador is gon na be . the feds will be keepin ' a lid on everything . you thing you can do that ?
this is my city . i 'm a cop . i 'll find em .	alright , johnson , thank you . so ... what are you wearing ?
oh my god ... what happened to you ?	it 's called a dress .
wait a minute . i 'm not riding in that .	what ? ! this is a class ride , johnson .
yeah , if you 're superfly .	that 's it ! you can attack me , but when you attack my car , i can not forgive ! you in the back , girl !
you do n't like it ?	it 's okay . for restaurants .
you ok ?	we saved the girl and got the bad guys , did n't we ?
yeah . so why you look do down ?	look at me ! my dress is ruined . i look like shit .
how about a lift home ?	absolutely . i 'll even let you ride in the front seat .
any demands yet ?	at this point we do n't have much .
how much they want ?	you come highly recommended , carter . and your particular assignment requires a special talent .
... the director considers this top priority , considering he is a chinese national and here under difficult circumstances . his name is lee . and he is to be shown every courtesy . within reason .	sir , he 's just gon na get in my way . if i 'm gon na handle this situation ...
i 'm talking about the girl .	do n't worry about the kidnapping , carter , the f.b.i . will handle that . your assignment is lee .
what kind of assignment is that ?	bottom line : i do n't want some chung king cop getting his head blown off and turning this operation into a international incident .
why do n't you assign one of your own men to this ?	because with your special talents , i 'm sure you 'll do a better job .
what the hell am i supposed to do with him ? take him to the zoo ?	just make him think you 're following leads . interview some suspects , look at fingerprints , do detective shit . i do n't care . i just do n't want to see him- or you , for that matter- until this is resolved . now , we want to make a good impression , do n't we ? his plane lands in an hour . do n't be late .
what do you mean you lost him ? ! how could you lose him ? !	try a bus load of - no , make that two bus loads of chinese --
you understand what i 'm sayin ' ?	carter , shut up !
yo , johnson ...	you think this is funny , carter ? you send for someone from explosives ! ? four men just died in there !
hey , man , you can use her . she 's an expert !	that 's what you were supposed to be !
hmmmm ?	do n't play bullshit games with me .
oh yeah . the caller was a man . confident . had an accent . my guess , asian . anything else i can do for the fbi , sir ?	why do n't you try the assignment . or should i call and ask for somebody who can handle it ?
okay , let me start from the top . a few days ago i was on this munitions dealer named lafontaine . now , after the shit blew up last night ...	i 'm not interested , carter . you 're no longer on this assignment .
what ? !	and your buddy , mr. lee , is on his way back to china . now , get out . before i file obstruction of justice charges against you .
hey , hey , you start touching me there , i 'm gon na start movin ' ! word up , mother ...	shut up !
you a cop or something ?	or somethin ' .
this is not a good way to start a relationship , stickin ' a gun to a man 's head , feelin ' around his personal equipment . make him think you do n't trust him .	i do n't trust anybody . especially first time deals .
i oughta pat your ass down . make sure you 're not a cop .	nobody touches me .
you know something ? every time i see this stuff , it reminds me of ... uh ... a double latte grande ... with two shots of non-fat milk .	what are you talking about ?
what 's this little green wire coming out one side of the package ?	i would n't touch that if i were you .
okay , look , we 're gon na make a trade . you cross the street , leave her on the sidewalk . i will leave him on this side . then we trade places . you get him , i get her . get the picture , lois ?	do it !
you got a boy friend in here yet ? cause you 're gon na need somebody to kiss your ass goodbye .	what are you talking about ?
you 're movin ' to death row . see , your fingerprints are now on the murder weapon of four fbi agents . and when i turn this into the lab , they 're gon na find lafontaine all over it . and we already know ... ... this is your mo .	how did i do this ? ! maybe you did n't notice but i 'm in jail !
you sonuvabitch .	i 'm waitin ' here for a name .
where do we find him ?	you do n't . he finds you . through his people .
hello .	ambassador han .
yes .	even if you deny the fbi is there , i will assume you are lying .
my daughter .	she 's fine .
yes .	you have run out of time . the amount now is two hundred million . i will call later with instructions . you will either deliver the money or pick up the body of your daughter .
hello .	take the money with you tonight . pack it in six dragons . you will be contacted again .
hello .	han ?
yes .	it 's griffin .
yes .	you have what i asked for ?
i do .	pack it into black garbage bags . throw the bags into a garbage dump in the alley behind the fang shan restaurant in china town . you have twenty-nine minutes left .
i would like one of my people to help .	ambassador , let me assure you that the fbi has made this a top priority . we have plenty of manpower on the case .
he is very good .	as i said , sir , we 've got all the people we need .
i am not an american , mr. russ . my daughter is not an american .	i understand , sir . but you are an honored guest of the united states ...
come on . let 's get you some dry clothes .	carter , can i have a moment ?
i am so sorry about your men .	yes sir , me too . the state department has authorized release of the funds . we 'll have to make the first drop at 7. as soon as they pick up the money , we 've got em .
and mr. lee ? where is he ?	do n't worry , he 's with carter .
when were you going to tell me you were not going with us ?	i still have work to do here .
i do n't believe you . my father was explaining to mr. griffin . that is how i found out .	i was trying to find the right time .
i will not have friends in america .	soon young , do n't worry . you will have many friends very soon . you will see . america is a very friendly place .
what is he up to now ?	ike just came by to check out the team .
bob -- are you making friends with this man ?	i 'm just bragging about how great you are . i 'm the luckiest man alive .
at the wedding ? you invite him ? bob , do n't you realize he 's writing another article about me ?	sure i do . but the bet defense is a good offense , right ? you 're not going to let your opponent throw you off your game .
you do n't understand this guy .	let him come to the wedding . you 're not running , right ? say it . `` i 'm not ... ''
i 'm not running .	so if you 're not running and ike graham is there to see it , then any article he writes has got to have a happy ending , right ? all we 're doing is turning lemon into lemonade .
right .	i lead maggie through a visualization exercise . all the sports shrinks use this head stuff . visualize the end zone , if you catch my drift .
yes .	let me take you back inside , okay ?
ahh .	i 'm the town 's unofficial fitness trainer . big advocate of the mind and body combining for success . you could say or you can quote me , i 'm a glass half full king of guy .
see you at the wedding .	you bet ya , coach .
at this pace , it could be an evening wedding .	hold it ! hold it ! i think we 're taking this too fast .
what do you expect me to say to this ?	how about -- `` i hope you 'll be very happy together '' ?
you look awful .	thank you .
really ?	i did n't want to find out i was n't for her in the fourth quarter .
got any last minute advice ?	maintain eye contact .
actually , he only asked me one ridiculous question . the rest were n't so bad .	what ? you talked to him ! did you tell him we dated before you were a priest ?
yes , yes , i 'm sure i only did you good , maggie .	what did he ask ?
only respectful things . what did we have in common back then ... what kind of music did you like ... did you ruin my life when you left me standing at the altar ...	and what did you say ?
how could i be angry at you when clearly what has happened to me is as god intended ?	good one ! thanks .
god ... of course . i 'm sorry -- i mean , i 'm ... brian -- i 've got to go . the man 's a lunatic , but i know exactly where he 's going next .	god bless you , maggie .
he wanted to know how you used to like your eggs .	weird . like after all those years you would remem --
i 'm really sorry that i hurt you , brian .	i 'm happy here , where i 'm supposed to be . but if you ever become a catholic , may i ask you a favor , maggie ?
of course .	could your confess to father patrick from now on ?
that 's it . back to obedience school .	okay -- have a seat ... gently , carefully .
and in a `` v '' .	eight is good ... `` v '' could be victory .
we do it to our dog .	it 's hurting .
i 'll get the dress .	he 's here ! ... he 's here !
tell me , why does maggie need another wedding rehearsal and two days before the wedding ? she 's already done this .	bob is making her visualize the ceremony .
bob 's in a hurry .	do n't be nervous , maggie . let us visualize . remember what bob said ? `` be the ball . ''
`` sink the putt . ''	`` make the shot . ''
`` nothing but net . ''	`` never say die . ''
i love his eyes . i just believe they 're listening to you .	his hair ... any color .
rub your ears .	yes , rubbing your ears is very soothing . cory does that to me when i hyperventilate .
fully . i like her . she has wit .	i left four messages . you do n't return my calls .
-- it 's for you , ike .	what ?
lesson number two . never work for your former spouse .	that 's not nothing to do with it . you cooked this story up and you know it .
i did n't cook up a story . i had a source .	someone reliable , i 'm sure . a booze- hound in a bar ?
no , that 's what makes you unemployed .	i merely write the stuff . you 're the one that serves it up .
lawyers . i do n't know , ellie -- firing me is going to be very tough on you . it 's going to be hard to get over . there will be therapy bills for you .	i already made an appointment for later today .
see ? you want custody of my job ? ... why not just consider my wrist slapped and call me when you feel i 've served my time ?	i 'm sorry , ike . this is permanent .
fisher , let him talk .	but one of those guys -- not one of them -- knew her at all . each one was convinced that she was perfect for them , but they did n't see her . and she never showed up so they could n't see her . it 's a very symbolic thing happening . she becomes what she thinks they wanted to be .
is that what i did to you ? is that what happened ? did i just not see you ?	no . no , you did n't .
well -- i 'm sorry , i 'm really sorry , ellie .	i 'm sorry , too . wow . that only took us between years to say .
maggie !	where do you think she 's going ?
overpriced nice apartment and chinese takeout . that 's new york living .	... just call me when you have it . ike , how is the story coming ? is she a man-eater ?
or a vegetarian ?	or does she pick `` ngb 's '' -- `` nice guys , but ... '' nice guys , but i 'm cheap . nice guys , but he lives with his mom ... nice guys , but he just out of prison .
look , he 's running after her .	look , he 's in pretty good shape .
ellie asked me to come down to offer moral support .	since when does ellie need moral supp --
in vino veritas .	do n't knock drunk guys in bars . drunk guys in bars are good . it means they 're not driving .
ike , i really liked the runaway bride piece , and since i do freelance stuff for g.q. , i 'm in a different position now ...	what are you trying to say to me , fish ?
vindication . how would you like to get some ? a chance to prove that , though your facts were n't entirely straight , your theory was correct .	the real story on miss carpenter .
the anatomy of the black widow spider of maryland .	it would n't be a bad way to get you back into writing feature pieces again .
if she runs , then it 's a cover story . all true . all accurate .	okay , you were right . i hated my column , but i can do this assignment .
then you 've got it . if you leave tomorrow for the hinterlands , you 'll have plenty of time before her next wedding trot .	`` paid vindication '' that 's what i call justice .
justice , yes . paid , i do n't know . they like the idea , but my hands are tied with budget restraints .	but i 'll get my normal fee , right ?
do n't say `` spec '' like it 's a dirty word . nobody ever paid shakespeare to write a play ! plato never got a book advance ...	oh yeah ! i happen to know from reliable sources that nietzche got expenses and a rental car .
yes , well , my theory was that she may be running because she gets attention ... negative attention is attention . like when women whack you on the street because of your column , that 's negative attention .	this is about her negative attention , not mine . did you get the reimbursement for the dress yet ?
no , i 'm paying for the dress . do you think she 's still gon na run ?	i do n't know .
look -- i 'll be in there later today . i 'll come by and tell you all about it .	you 're coming here ?
yeah .	then come for dinner .
okay , we 'll order out .	order out like a philistine , when you got the galloping gourmet here ? ...
no ... they 're interesting guys . each one of these guys has something going for him . i mean , one 's been up everest . another 's become a priest . one 's a pretty good guitar player . and this guy today tried to end world hunger , if you can believe that ...	whoa , ike . getting a complex , buddy ?
of course we are . of course .	then you 'll be my best man .
well , i 'm good , i do n't know if i 'm best .	go talk to the pastor and he 'll tell you what to do . and someone will tell me what to do .
i have no idea what i 'm doing .	your job is ... the ring . do you have the ring ? !
get this man a kamikaze .	splendid dissection of maggie carpenter , very professional job .
you could have told me you were fiance number three .	and end up in the papers ? i 've been humiliated enough already to last a lifetime , thank you . i 'm sorry she got you canned .
thanks .	she 's a cacophony of contradictions .
well , i 'm writing another article on the cacophony .	ah , ca n't stay away from her , can you ? like a moth to a flame .
guess you 'd know about that . you 're an entomologist , right ? how 's business ?	not bad . i was traveling around studying the reproductive and migratory patterns of locusts when maggie met me .
same as you said . what did you call her ? a `` man-eater '' , `` a devouring death goddess . ''	i do n't think that 's why she ran .
i do n't know . i 'm working on it . i was on the wrong track .	and you defending her ?
no . i call it like i see it . i 'm a journalist . i 'm a truth teller .	unbelievable , she got to you .
sorry , no . i just got one .	excuse me , sir . i have an actual fact for you .
yes , mrs. pressman .	it 's her fourth time to the altar , you know . not seven like they said .
i 'm not sure . mr. schullian runs the newsstand , he 's our local bookie , you know , he 's giving eight to one odds she wo n't . he says she 's so famous now , maybe vegas will give odds on her . i 'm going to wait to hear what the pros say .	good fact . well , you let me know .
well , i 'm off . a reporter 's work is never done . mrs. pressman , thank you .	tootaloo .
it 's okay . there 's no microphone . you 're no fun .	no , i 'm not .
hello . i 'm looking for maggie carpenter . there was a sign at the hardware store across the street ...	are you a reporter ?
what ?	it 's been our experience that anyone with some sort of gewgaw on his loafers ends up being another big city reporter wanting to interview maggie .
about her upcoming wedding and all .	no , about her getting that asshole from new york fired .
i am just such a reporter . and you are ?	peggy phleming . not the ice skater .
and you are ?	looking for maggie .
i think you 'd look good in red .	no , she 's talking about your hair .
have you listened to his morning show , `` wake up with ballplayer '' ?	not yet . i had a phlemless morning . i hear he 's a pretty good ballplayer .
this game is pretty important to him . he made all-stars in high school , you know .	that must have made you proud .
it 's nice that they 're still friends .	oh , sure . that was a long time ago . see , she 's not a man-hater at all . she 's very supportive of men ...
yes , i am . and who are you ?	betty trout . five dollars .
oh , betty . i take it you 're going to be making the wedding cake and they say you 're throwing --	-- the luau for maggie .
your two cinnamon rolls .	bye , betty . thanks .
you should thank lou and i for the wedding car -- a '63 buick .	thank you .
they made me put my hat back on .	oh , yeah . scared the hell out of skipper .
gee , i hope they do n't have a fight out there . you do n't think they 'll call it off ... ?	well , wedding cake freezes . this we know .
like her mother .	ah , beautiful . i just ca n't see her leaving multiple grooms in the dust like that .
dad 's fishing trip , grandma 's knee operation , grandma 's birthday ...	got ta tell you this about my daughter . my daughter makes real good time , even in a long dress and heels . maggie may not be hale 's longest running joke , but she certainly is the fastest .
i hope you have a different angle . it 's pretty much all been covered .	originality is my speciality .
well , instead of a haircut , how about a wash ? you know , get all that city grit out of it .	you 'll answer my questions ?
getting nervous ?	nervous ? not at all ! no . i 've never been more certain in my life . except -- i am having all kinds of weird dreams .
weird dreams ? you 're going to tell me about them ?	yes .
i 'm not here to make you feel bad . i 'm here for vindication . in my heart ...	you have one ?
did something happen to make you care about reality ?	yes . conviction . conviction that i 'm onto the truth . you 're going to do the same thing to `` poor bastard number four '' that you did to the last three . you 're going to run again . and i 'm not leaving until you do .
you 're going to be very disappointed .	we 'll see .
that 's fair .	despite what you think , i do n't do it on purpose . and i have no intention of doing it again .
everest . is that right ?	twice ...
really ?	without oxygen ...
how romantic .	we think so .
grandma made me the cutest outfit . i ca n't wait to show it to you .	a pre-wedding luau ?
give me that !	but the most interesting thing here is that i do n't see the rose tattoo that i 've heard about on your back .
look , look , man . i think the man is heartbroken .	he is not !
you 've been here for three minutes . what did you do to her ?	you can turn that finger around .
you misinterpret everything . we 've all been friends our whole lives . but that 's the types of relationship you would n't understand .	obviously , i 'm not the only one who does n't understand it . the uss maggie leaves quite a wake ... excuse me .
i take it the desk clerk is one of your many admirers .	how do i do it ? i 'm not that beautiful .
you 're welcome . your notes made interesting bedtime reading -- if you like trashy fiction . your observations are distorted , ungrounded an incomplete . you must be very proud .	i 'm not a boastful man . what 's your point ?
my point is that one again , you 're getting it all wrong . that wo n't improve your reputation any , and it 's not very flattering to me either . so , i 'm going to give you a chance to write the truth .	really .
my magazine does n't pay because for stories . it 's not what you call ethical .	oh , but making up the facts as you go along is ethical ? actually , i meant you . you probably got severance or expenses or both . i 'll take your check . no credit cards .
you 've seen the post-its . i 've already got more juicy material than i need . why should i pay you dollar one ?	because i think you 're writing on spec and with a first person interview , you might actually sell that thing .
too much .	seven-fifty .
five hundred .	six-fifty .
it 's a birthday present for my cousin . put your finger in .	cindy the manicurist .
i think so .	i like it . this whole thing is pretty incredible . i think you could probably sell this lamp idea in new york .
maybe someday .	you afraid to try ?
no , i 'm not afraid . just ... maybe someday .	well , i 'm impressed . absolutely incredible . i did n't expect pink and lacy , but this is n't exactly a woman 's room .
always a mood killer .	still sweet .
it 's a little `` silence of the lambs '' for me . i ca n't believe you waited for the wedding to run .	he 's an entomologist ! i thought it was very unique .
it was one of the most wonderful moments of my life . cal ripken even applauded .	highly suspect .
what do you mean ? it was incredibly romantic !	maybe it 's just me , but -- if you got to dress it up , it does n't ring true .
i 'm a work in progress .	so ? is that what you said to her ?
no . i think i said something eloquent like , `` so , uh -- maybe we should , ya know . what do you think ? ''	now that 's romantic . a proposal like that and you did n't find eternal bliss ? what went wrong ?
i do n't know .	you do n't know .
no .	maybe you should ask her some time . ever thought of that ?
even with everything that 's happened i 've still never been married and i still deserve a beautiful dress .	agreed .
you look ... uh ... you look fine .	fine . the newspaper 's upside down . that 's better than fine .
i 'll have the same .	of course .
tell me . when you get to the altar , will you spike the bouquet ?	you know , there 's no ...
ike ... hi , grandma .	gram here was going to give me the skinny on why you run from marital bliss .
oh , my god -- it 's miles davis . this is `` king of blue '' ! this is the original recording . hard to find in good condition . where did you find this ?	it was in the attic . it was jus sitting there gathering dust .
it 's valuable . hang onto it .	no . you take it .
hmmm ... figuring out what kind of music i like and then finding me a rare album . you 're not trying to soften me up , are you ?	no -- i 'm cleaning an attic . i would n't attempt the impossible .
watch your leg , dad . i 'm so tired of this .	why do n't you let him sleep it off in the trunk . i 'll take you for a ride . then we 'll come back for him . keep an eye on him .
your filter 's clogged . this takes unleaded .	can you fix it ?
first i have to find some tools . i need a half and a nine-six-tenth .	of what ?
kind of isolated .	yeah . it 's kind of nice .
no . but i think attraction is too often mistaken for rightness . attraction is very misleading . and if it 's mutual , it 's well , terribly distracting .	yes it is . and it does n't mean anything .
where did you disappear to ?	missed me bad , huh ?
i do n't know , give me a minute . are you all right with this ?	excuse me ?
are you all right with this ? you think this is funny ?	yes .
i 'm the only goddamn person in there pulling for you .	you humiliated me !
no , maggie , i defended you . humiliating you is what everyone else is doing . it 's the theme of this party .	i had it under control . now they feel sorry for me .
it 's fun ! it 's high .	or the sexual habits of locusts ?
that was very interesting research george was doing !	what kind of dead head gets a temporary tattoo ?
i already explained about that .	and where you ever really going to run the leper colony in molokai ?
brian told you that ?	or maybe you just wanted to wear the headdress .
every one of those times i was being supportive . something you wo n't understand .	supportive ? you were n't being supportive . you were being scared . just like now . you are the most lost woman i have ever laid eyes on .
lost !	that 's right . you 're so lost you do n't even know how you like your eggs .
what ! ?	with the priest , you liked them scrambled . with the dead head , fried . with the bug guy , poached . now it 's egg whites only , thank you very much .
that 's called changing your mind .	no , that 's called not having a mind of your own . what are you doing , maggie ? you really want to let that man drag you up annapuma on your honeymoon ? you do n't want to climb annapuma .
yes i do !	no you do n't . you want a man who will lead you down the beach with his head over your eyes just so you can discover the feel of the sand under your feet . you want a guy who will take you into a cave with a thousand candles just to read you a poem . you want a man to wake you up at dawn because he 's burning to talk to you and he ca n't wait another minute to find out what you 'll say . am i right ?
no . no -- actually , let 's make ike the pastor .	i 'd rather not .
i 'm sorry , bob . she kissed me back .	i kissed him back .
about a minute ... ?	a little longer for me .
okay . so ... what , uh ... what just happened ? just now ? jus then ? in there ?	i do n't know . i , uh -- i frankly do n't even want to talk about it .
i love you . i love you .	i love you , too .
to who ? are you asking me ?	me ?
yes , you !	well , you do have the dress .
and the church .	and the wedding date . there 's the two of us . so , you think ... maybe ... you have to go down the aisle with somebody you love and who love you back .
i 'm okay with that .	so am i .
i 've been making friends with your cat . is it okay that i 'm here ?	i do n't have much choice in the matter now , do i ? but i ca n't speak for italics . traitor !
livid is good . so what is it , maggie ? you here on business ? i saw your lamps . they 're terrific .	it 's something i 've always wanted to do .
you actually could make breaking and entering into a new career . so , what are you doing here ?	i wanted to talk to you about why i run or ride away from things .
does it matter ?	i think so ... when i was walking down the aisle ? i was walking toward somebody who did n't have any idea who i really was . and it was only half the other person 's fault , because i had done everything to convince him that i was exactly what he wanted . so it was good that i did n't go through with it because it would have been a lie , but you -- you knew the real me .
yes , i did .	i did n't . and you being the one at the end of the aisle did n't just fix that .
used ?	they 're mine . i 'm turning in my running shoes to you .
you were not .	i was , because if you said `` yes '' right away , i would n't get to say this next part . and i 've been practicing it . ready ?
i 'm listening .	`` i guarantee that we 'll have tough times . i guarantee that at some point one or both oof us will want to get out . but i also guarantee that if i do n't ask you to be mine , i 'll regret it for the rest of my life . because i know in my heart -- you 're the only one for me '' .
pretty good speech , maggie .	i borrowed it from this guy i know . so ?
so -- mag -- you 've seen this , huh ?	yes , i 've seen it . and i have to say it 's the rudest and most offensive ... joke anybody 's ever played on me !
you 're a goddess !	i did n't even need to change this gasket , just put in a little hydraulic fluid .
reporter ?	yup !
hold on -- nobody interviews maggie in here unless they 're getting haircut .	she 's the boss .
okay , he 's on base . can we talk about my life now ? -- ike 's going to turn that tattoo stuff into a big deal -- that i was never serious about gill , blah blah . he 's totally out to get me .	for what reason ? some personal satisfaction ?
that 's what he says , but if he thinks that i do n't realize he 's writing another article , then he 's an idiot .	it 's probably because you got him fired .
ya think ?	not that he does n't deserve to get fired ... look ! cory 's going for second ! ... sneaky !
there he is . snoop doggy-dogg .	where ?
over there . ten o'clock . he 's talking to our little dennis . dennis will turn into one of those `` sources say '' things .	he looks better with that stuff out of his hair . he 's an attractive man .
good morning to you , too . you look good .	thank you . do you think i flirt with cory ?
i know . i think sometimes you just sort of spaz-out with random excess flirtation energy and it just lands on anything male that moves .	on anything male that moves ? as opposed to anything male that does n't move ?
i 'm going to kill myself .	why ?
because you think i 'm all like ... `` hey man , check me out '' .	no , i do n't think you 're like , `` i 'm charming and mysterious in a way that even i do n't understand and something about me is crying out for protection from a big man like you '' . very hard to compete with . especially to us married women who have lost our mystery .
but you have n't lost your mystery ! you 're very mysterious !	no . i 'm weird . weird and mysterious are two different things .
but i 'm weird .	no . you 're quirky . quirky and weird are two different things .
i 'm not worried about you and cory or cory and me or even that you 're irreversibly screwed up . but , maggie , you 've been like this since we were kids . and i think now that you are aware of it and that it hurts people 's feelings , maybe it 's time to move on with your life and commit to someone of your own , like bob , if he 's the one .	i think you 're right . is there anything i can do to make it up to you ?
something that brings warmth to my heart . duckbill platypus .	it 's only funny at camp birchwood at three in the morning at a tick hunt . it 's not anymore .
you 're right . it 's not funny now . maybe we both grew up .	thanks . will you fix my hair ?
lighten up , wahine .	lighten up , what ?
this party is for you and bob . get your mind off the reporter .	i have n't seen him in twenty-four hours . it just gives me the creeps a little bit . i 'd feel better if i knew where he was .
he 's going to be the pastor ?	yep . i want him to be front and center and to watch everything .
what happened at the luau ?	... i do n't even want to talk about the luau . what 's this ?
grandma !	see , this is a mature relationship . she 's really found it .
he 's not coming . watch . he 's not coming .	no , no . i saw eight geese flying in a `` v '' .
you and your lucky geese . you always see geese .	not eight ...
let 's go .	no sauntering down the aisle . just make time . let 's just get there .
you okay ? i 'm closing .	i 'm just finishing up , too .
want to go to butch 's for a drink or something ?	no , i 'm just going to head home .
what are you talking about ?	wedding . wedding . you just have to get the rest of your ducks in a row .
thank you . you still think that he was ... .	quick . very quick .
so i 've come to see it as a bonus , really , that we 've been able to plan , and pay for , so many weddings .	not this one . this one 's on me .
i 'm not exactly having fun , either ... steady .	good boy , port hole .
his name is skipper , dad ... steady .	i changed it . see you later , mr. travis . that guy has a problem ... maggie , you can run everyone 's life but your own .
i 'm really rooting for this one .	thank you , dad .
what ?	just stop it . do n't say another word like that .
maggie , it 's just a joke ...	no . it 's my life .
a harmless joke .	no , it 's humiliating and you 've been doing it since i was a kid . i do n't like it . stop . you may not like having a daughter with problems . but guess what ? i do n't like having a father who 's drunk all the time . i 'll eat in my room .
`` what is unusual about miss carpenter is that she likes to dress her men up as grooms before she devours them . she has already disemboweled six in a row by leaving them at the altar. '' ... i ca n't ready anymore .	`` and her ritual feast continues as she prepares to make a sacrifice out of the seventh fiance . so all bets are on and we hope that this boomerang bride is n't honeymooning with las vegas odds makers because many predict that this girl is out of there before the race ... before the rice hits the ground '' holy moly .
you tell maggie .	no , you tell her .
no , no . you 're her best friend .	no .
you know , it 's just possible that she has n't read this yet .	yeah .
there 's no why , annie . i 'm just not up for it . i never said i was .	is there somebody else ?
nope .	you do n't love me , is that it ?
how about ... you 're too narcissistic to commit to another human being in a long- term way .	that 's good .
you take the microwave ?	what am i going to do with a microwave ?
you turn it on , you open it and you stand in front of it for a very long time .	so you 're angry . big deal .
tell me he 's living in squalor . tell me everything he has is being repossessed , including his filthy , dented mobile home .	he 's got a houseboat .
i hate boats .	it sounds nice .
boats . you go out in them . you come back in them . i hate them .	houseboats do n't go anywhere .
boats . all anyone talks about is the wind . is it up , is it down . i ca n't live with a man who only talks about the wind .	it 's not a boat boat . it 's really a house .
but it 's on the water .	it 's on the lake right in the middle of seattle . it rains nine months of the year in seattle .
i hope i do n't have to pay for that piece of information .	no , that 's free . he 's an architect . used to do big high-profile projects . he scaled it all back when his wife died . now he remodels people 's homes . he works in a small firm , makes a good living .
the short one with black hair is your cousin irene --	-- who 's married to --
harold , who ran away with his secretary but came back --	-- because irene threatened to put the dog to sleep if he did n't --
and your brother tom is a psychology professor and is married to ... betsy --	-- who is the most competitive woman in the world --
your uncle milton lost all his money in a puerto rican condominium that went belly up , do n't mention the irs or the federal prison system . your mother is barbara , your father is cliff --	i hope he does n't get out his slides .
am i what they had in mind ?	they 're going to love you .
do n't touch them . i feel terrible sneezing at a time like this . this is a big moment for me --	he 's allergic to everything , do n't worry about it --
if he eats one tiny piece of a nut --	my head swells up like a watermelon and i drop dead .
is that all right with you ?	today i consider myself the luckiest man on the face of the earth .
they loved you . i told you they would love you and they did .	i love you .
i love you , walter . did anyone ever call you anything other than walter ?	nope .
even when you were young ?	nope . not even when i was young .
you sure you do n't want to drive with me ?	how will i get back to baltimore saturday ? oh god , i forgot my present for your stepmother -- i took it inside by accident .
i 'll wait .	do n't be silly . i 'll just be ten minutes behind you .
happy new year , darling .	happy new year .
i was thinking , i have to go up to boston for the aap convention and then visit winston-hughes about switching over our computers . why do n't we meet in new york for valentine 's day weekend ?	walter , i 'd love to --
we 'll stay at the plaza --	go for a walk in central park --
we will ? the symphony ? okay . i 'll take you to the russian tea room for pelmeni .	what is it ?
it 's delicious , trust me .	does it have wheat in it ?
who is it ?	oh , it 's just becky , she 's having trouble with rich again . hold on , becky , i 'm going downstairs .
miss scarlett . in the broom closet . with the radio .	i got ta go . i 'll see you at work . walter , you scared me . do n't ever do that again .
becky heard this woman on the radio complaining about this guy she was sure was rick , which meant he was cheating on her . she was completely hysterical . then it turned out the woman lived in duluth .	that does n't make any sense .
could n't you just do a phone interview ?	not for the kind of place i want to do . i wo n't be in chicago that long .
when you get back , i 'll be gone --	and then i 'll see you in new york --
you go .	ever since christmas , you 've been different . kind of distracted , distant . but i feel like you 're coming back from wherever you were .
i am . i was just ... i just got ... i think i got nervous . it 's normal , right ? do n't you ever feel nervous about , you know ?	what ?
about forever .	no .
do n't hate me but i love this pattern .	you could n't .
i do .	it 's just like my grandmother 's china .
walter .	it was my mother 's .
beautiful view , is n't it ?	walter , there 's something i have to tell you --
i do n't know what to say about it , walter . it was a form of temporary insanity . but i had to tell you about it because --	-- it was a betrayal .
yes . but it was n't really . it was just ...	so what happened ?
i told you . nothing --	at the top of the empire state building --
i 'm not at the top of the empire state building . i 'm here .	not really . look , annie , i love you . let 's leave that out of it . i do n't want to be someone you 're settling for . i do n't want to be someone anyone settles for . i have a life insurance policy , i 'm fully invested in growth stocks , i have a paid subscription to home rox office , i have no sexual diseases , i have been steadily employed in a part of the economy that is n't soft , i have expectation in the way of inherited wealth , i dress nicely , i am a member of the private sector , an independent voter , i do n't watch monday night football , the only thing wrong with me is that i am allergic to wheat , strawberries , penicillin , pollen , nuts and wool . there are plenty of women who see me as the brass ring . if you do n't -- marriage is hard enough without bringing such low expectations into it , is n't it ?
oh , walter . i do n't deserve you .	i think that 's what i 'm saying .
you okay ?	yes . some people will do anything to get out of going to a symphony .
oh !	what ?
you should write something about this .	about what ?
it 's not true , but it feels true .	there 's practically a whole book about how that statistic is not true --
what was that about up there ?	what was what ?
what 's with you ?	nothing 's with me .
`` sleepless in seattle '' ?	that 's what she called him on the show . because he ca n't sleep .
and now 2,000 women want his number . the guy could be a crackhead , a psychopath , a flasher , a junkie , a transvestite , a chain-saw murderer , or someone really sick , like rick .	actually , he sounded nice .
oh ? oh , really ? now we 're getting down to it .	not .
you 're a basket case .	they knew it . time , distance , nothing could separate them . because they knew . it was right . it was real . it was ...
... movie . that 's your problem . you do n't want to be in love . you want to be in love in a movie . read it to me .	`` dear sleepless and son ... ''
it sounds like the name of a mattress store --	`` i am not the sort of person who listens to call-in radio shows '' --
and this woman is a writer ! that 's what everyone writes at the beginning of letters to strangers .	i know that . you think i do n't know that ? `` i know that 's a dumb way to begin , but it 's the only way i can think of to convey what happened to me the other night when i heard the two of you on the radio . on the other hand , maybe i 'm just losing my mind . ''
you are . you 're losing your mind . what about walter ?	i 'm going to marry walter . i just have to get this out of my system .
right .	i should say something in this about magic .
what ?	i do n't know . i mean , what if i never meet him ? what if this man is my destiny and i never meet him ?
your destiny can be your doom . look at me and rick .	`` i want to meet you ... ''
`` on top of the empire state building at sunset on valentine 's day . ''	good . perfect . i 'll be in new york with walter , i can squeeze it in .
you want to hear about destiny ? if my husband had n't gone on a diet , which caused me to leave him , i would never have been on that flight to miami , and met rick , and ended up having sex in the bathroom of a 727 with that nob you slide that says `` vacant-occupied , vacant- occupied , vacant-occupied '' --	you never told me you left your husband because he went on a diet .
he lost all the weight ... there .	that 's impossible . a guy ca n't --
can too .	no .
yes .	and then you left him ? he lost weight there and you left him ?
plus he fell in love with a temp .	listen to this , i love this part --
men never get this movie .	i know .
do you think at the end of the movie when she 's in the wheelchair they can still do it ?	i always wondered about that too .
hello .	turn on your radio !
what ?	the kid is on . you 've got me listening to this garbage . go on , turn it on .
i thought i would look into doing a story about those radio shows .	you 'd probably have to go somewhere to really look into it .
did you talk to him ?	i could n't do it . how did i get here ?
you told a lie and got on a plane .	that 's not what i mean . i 'm going back over there tomorrow and talk to him . i am .
okay . good . goodbye .	becky ?
what ?	is this crazy ?
no . that 's the weirdest part about it .	thank you . i love you .
i love you , too .	good night .
you were standing in the middle of the street ?	you know that dream where you 're walking down the street naked and everyone is looking at you ?
i love that dream .	that was nothing compared to this humiliation , nothing .
but he saw you , right ?	he said hello .
it 's a sign --	it 's a sign i 've watched this movie too many times . i 'm so stupid . from the minute i listen to that stupid program on the radio , i 've been a complete jerk .
you do n't know who she was , annie --	i saw her . she looked just like this --
this is a photo of hair .	well , it 's the same woman . and he was crazy about her . what is this ? this is from seattle .
becky ?	so i mailed your letter .
`` dear annie : thanks for your letter . it was great . we 're very excited about meeting you in new york on valentine 's day and seeing if we are m.f.e.o . sleepless in seattle . ''	m.f.e.o . ?
so he ca n't write . big deal . i mean , verbal ability is a highly overrated thing in a guy , and our pathetic need for it is what gets us into so much trouble .	i 'm going to run back to walter 's arms , if he 's still have me .
what about the letter ?	it does n't mean anything . it was written before i went out there . before the ho .
you 're going to miss the train .	no , i 'm not .
what are your plans in new york ?	we 're going to the rainbow room and the symphony tomorrow night .
i love the symphony .	i hate it . i 'm so happy , becky . finally i feel happy . this is right . this is real . everything else is what happens when you watch too many movies and completely lose sight of what counts . please do n't tell anyone about what happened . `` sleepless in seattle '' is history .
i need to know about him because ... he 's involved with my sister ...	okay .
she has a pattern of getting involved with losers ... once she almost ran away with a human cannonball from the circus .	do you want a matrimonial , past wives , any kids --
no , i know that part --	so you want a financial , is he a deadbeat , we can do a d & b --
no , no , no , it 's more like , who is he , does he have a sense of humor , is he nice -- no forget nice , i 've got nice --	a sense of humor .
i 'll tell you the truth , i heard this guy on a call-in radio show and i might not marry the person i should marry because i 've become obsessed with him .	oh . like glenn close in that movie .
no . not remotely . i just want to find out about him .	you want a tail . i got a guy in seattle --
honey , he was n't right for you .	i know .
he was n't even wrong for you , like < u > cosmically < /u > wrong , so do n't beat up on yourself for wasting ... however long it was .	i know .
maybe you should see a shrink .	i want my money .
go home for the weekend .	that 's what i 'm going to do . i 'm going to go home . i quit . laurie , i quit . i 'm going back to baltimore . how does a blonde do a high- five ?
perfect . sandbag the father .	and you crazy ? he thinks shows like this are dumb . if you did n't have an 800 number i could never get away with this --
please --	this is a grotesque violation of this man 's personal life , but never mind --
this is a complete disaster . i wanted him to find a wife , but he 's got the wrong one --	how am i going to explain this to walter ?
oh god , it 's major . he 's kissing her on the lips . i have to stop this .	come on , jonah --
are you annie ?	yes .
i 'm jonah . that 's my dad . his name is sam .	hi , jonah . sam . and who is this ?
howard .	howard .
i think i 'm going crazy , tom . i really do . are you happily married ?	what ?
i mean , why did you get married ? was it all fireworks and trumpets and --	i got married because betsy said we had to break up or get married . so we get married .
but when you met her , did you believe she was the only person for you ? that in some mystical , cosmic way , it was fated ?	annie , when you meet someone and you 're attracted to them , it just means that your subconscious is attracted to their subconscious , subconsciously . so what we think of as chemistry is just two neuroses knowing that they are a perfect match .
i do n't even know him . but i 'm having all these fantasies about a man i 've never met , who lives in seattle .	it rains nine months of the year in seattle .
i know , i know . i do not want to move to seattle . but what i really do n't want to do is end up always wondering what might have happened and knowing i could have done something . what do you think ? it 's just cold feet , is n't it ? everyone panics before they get married , did n't you ?	yes , i did .
thank you , tom . i feel so much better just having blown this off .	any time .
everybody ! annie has an announcement --	walter and i are engaged !
it 's probably just the flowers --	we 'll move them --
the historical society wanted this and i never would give it to them --	granny 's dress . oh , mom .
i notice these things are back in fashion . oh , honey . he 's a lovely man , annie .	i know . he 's wonderful , is n't he ?
are his folks nice ?	you 'll love them . we 're going down to d.c. tonight to be with them christmas morning .
it 's silly , really . i mean , i 'd seen him at the office , obviously i 'd seen him , he 's the associate publisher , and then one day we both ordered sandwiches from the same place , and he got my lettuce and tomato sandwich on whole wheat , which of course he was allergic to , and i got his lettuce and tomato on white .	how amazing .
it is , is n't it ? you make millions of decisions that mean nothing and then one day you decide to order takeout and it changes your life .	destiny takes a hand .
oh , please . destiny 's just something we 've invented because we ca n't stand the fact that everything that happens is accidental .	then how do you explain that you both ordered exactly the same sandwich except for the bread ? how many people in this world like lettuce and tomato without something else like tuna ?
i was in atlantic city with my family . cliff was a waiter . he talked me into sneaking out for a midnight walk on the steel pier . i 've probably told you this a million times , but i do n't care . and then he held my hand . i was scared . all sorts of thing were going through my head . but after a while i forgot about them . at one point i looked down , at our hands , and i could n't tell which fingers were mine and which were his . and i knew .	what ?
you know .	what ?
magic . it was magic .	magic .
i knew we would be together forever , and that everything would be wonderful , just the way you feel about walter . walter . it 's quite a formal name , is n't it ? one of the things i truly knew was that your father and i were going to have a wonderful time ... in the sack i believe you call it --	mom !
of course it took several years before everything worked like clockwork in that department , so do n't be worried if it takes a while --	mom , we already ...
well , fine , fine . fiddle da dee . and how 's it working ?	like ... clockwork .
so you 'll get married in a new dress .	it 's a sign .
sure you do .	sure you do --
you touch her for the first time , and suddenly ... you 're home . it 's almost like ...	magic .
hello .	hello .
hi .	hi . so far so good . so . what should we talk about ? how insecure we were in high school . shirley votypka , the first girl i ever felt up . health . what about health ? did you know that eating six macadamia nuts is the equivalent of eating a steak ?
it 's you .	it 's me ?
which means --	the cabinets have to be redone --
great . this is great . the whole town knows . just out of curiosity , how do you two know ?	grace heard it .
grace the dispatcher . great .	the point is , take the client out to dinner and ask her to marry you and then maybe we wo n't have to redo the kitchen cabinets .
sam , if you 're not doing anything new year 's -- obviously you 're not doing anything new year 's -- we 're having some people over , all of them married , not one even remotely interested in playing around . does that sound great or what ? i ca n't think of the last time i was at a party when anything actually happened .	thanks , but i 'll pass . it 's kind of a big night . i do n't like to leave jonah alone .
hello .	hello , sam , this is dr. marcia fieldstone on network america .
i 'm probably not interested in whatever you 're selling .	i 'm not selling anything . your son called and asked for advice on how to find you a new wife .
who is this ?	dr. marcia fieldstone of network america .
i 'm not mad at you . okay , i 'm not mad at you .	i think it 's hard for him to talk to you about all this . maybe we could talk and it would make him feel a little better .
all righ ...	good . how long ago did your wife die ?
it 's been about a year and a half .	have you had any relationship since ?
why not ?	look , doctor , i do n't want to be rude , but --
we 've been talking to -- well , let 's just call him sleepless in seattle , and we 'll be right back after this break with listener response , < u > your < /u > response , to the things we 've been discussing . the number to call is ...	what 's she talking about ?
do you think there 's somebody out there you could love as much as your wife ? maybe even more ?	it 's hard to imagine .
what are you going to do , sam ?	i do n't know . when i met my wife , it was so clear . i just < u > knew < /u > .
what was it that made you know ?	i do n't think i could really describe it .
why not ?	and if i could describe it , it probably would n't be on a radio show . but what the hell . it 's not one specific thing . it 's more of a feeling .
no last names , jonah . hello there , you sound younger than our usual callers . how come you 're up so late ?	it 's not that late in seattle .
got me there . what 's your christmas wish , jonah ?	it 's not for me . it 's for my dad . i think he needs a new wife .
you do n't like the one he was now ?	he does n't have one now . that 's the problem .
where 's your mom ?	she died .
i 'm sorry to hear that , jonah .	i 've been pretty sad , but i think my dad is worse .
and you 're worried about him .	i 'm worried about him , he 's worried about me , i ride my bike to school , he follows in the car , like i 'm not supposed to know he 's there . now it 's christmas , and you know what happens to people at christmas .
no .	why not ?
it 's very hard for him to talk about this stuff . it 's like it makes him sadder .	you want me to talk to him ?
is he home right now ?	yeah .
well , i think i can help a little more if i talk to him directly .	i do n't know --
i 'm sure he wo n't be angry once he realizes how concerned you are about him .	okay , but if i get yelled at , i 'm never gon na listen to this show again .
i have no doubt that you 're a good dad . you can tell a lot from a person 's voice . but something must be missing if jonah feels that you 're still under a cloud .	tell her how you do n't sleep at night .
they met at the empire state building , only they did n't . never mind .	what kind of person would write to someone they heard on the radio ?
just because someone 's looking for a nice guy does n't make them desperate .	how about rapacious and love- starved ?
no .	it is easier to be killed by a terrorist --
it is not --	right , right .
hey , my plate is full .	well , okay . what 's the big deal ? if she 'll forget the new fireplace , i 'll marry her . just point me in the right direction .
sandy has a girlfriend , clenda ... she 's a weightlifter , but it 's not like her neck is bigger than her head or anything --	i 'm not asking you to set me up , jay . that 's not what i need your help for . i want to know what it 's like over there .
and that 's what i 'm trying to tell you . what women are looking over , okay ? pecs and a cute butt .	you mean , like , `` he has the cutest butt '' ? where did i hear that recently ?
when 's the latest time you were out there ?	seventy ... eight .
well . things are different . first , you have to be friends . you have to like each other . then you neck . this can go on for years . then you have tests . then you get to do it with a condom . the good news is , split the check .	i do n't think it could let a woman pay for dinner .
great . they 'll have a parade in your honor . you 'll be man of the year in seattle magazine . tira misu .	what 's tira misu ?
you 'll find out .	what is it ?
you 'll see .	some woman is going to want me to do it to her and i 'm not going to know what it is .
you 'll like it .	this is going to be tougher than i thought .
dad , could you close the door ?	h and g. hi and goodbye .
write her .	you think so ?
it 's y. o. h .	yeah . what 's that ?
this is the best movie i 've ever seen in my life .	i do n't get it .
do you know how much it costs to go to new york ?	nobody knows . it changes practically every day . how much money do you have ?
eighty dollars .	i have forty-two . so that would definitely cover taxicabs , i think .
do you want an aisle or a window seat ?	window .
do you want a fruit plate ?	i do n't know . do i ?
dad --	what is it ?
i can hear you walking around sometimes . at first i thought it was a robber . go ahead , tell her , dad .	i do n't think i have to now .
the hopes are perfect -- beautiful , identical , smooth -- and they are for something really amazing i feel it in my bones --	it 's a spice rack .
dad ? about last night ?	it 's never happening again . right ?
not .	my feelings exactly .
how many people do you think heard that thing last night ?	it plays in 50 states .
what ? !	nobody else is going to know it was us .
dad , i do n't know about this one --	oh , you 're changing your mind --
no , i 'm not , but --	what 's the matter with this one ? would n't you like to have imelda marcos as your mother ?
does red pepper go under r or p ?	p. dad ?
what ?	i forgot to mention . jed called --
just out of curiosity , do you have any friends whose names do n't begin with a j ? i feel like it was a failure of the imagination on our part naming you jonah . what is marjoram ? does anyone know ?	jed is having a slumber party new year 's eve and he invited me .
fine . fine .	so i can go .
sure . looking good .	should n't you have used a toggle bolt ?
i 'm sorry . i 'm just --	stressed .
just out of curiosity , how did they get our address ?	they called and asked for it . `` dear sleepless in seattle . you are the most attractive man i 've ever laid ears on . ''
how did they get our phone number ?	you have to give them your phone number or they wo n't let you go on the air .
`` dear sleepless in seattle : i am an swf '' -- what is that ?	thank god . something you do n't know . it 's a single white female .
this is no good . she 's looking for someone french . or greek . `` dear sleepless in seattle : i live in tulsa . '' where is that ? --	oklahoma . do you know where that is ?
somewhere in the middle .	i 'm not going to think about what they 're not teaching you in school . i am not going to think about it . generally speaking i think we should rule out people who do n't live somewhere near here --
she looks like my third grade teacher . i hated my third grade teacher . hold it ! wait a minute ! she < u > is < /u > my third grade teacher !	dad , you 're not taking this seriously .
this is not how you do it . you want this on an english muffin or a bun ?	english muffin . how do you do it ?
you see someone you like , you get a feeling about them , you ask them if they want to have a drink or --	-- a slice of pizza --
but not dinner necessarily on the first date because by the time you 're halfway through dinner you might be sorry you asked them to dinner whereas if it 's just a drink , if you like them you can always ask them for dinner but if you do n't you can go home if you see what i mean . i wonder if it still works this way .	it does n't . they ask you .
if you get a new wife , i guess you 'll have sex with her , huh ?	what do you think ?
will she scratch up your back ?	what ?
in the movies women are always scratching up guy 's back and screaming and stuff . when they 're having sex .	whose show was this on ?
jed 's got cables .	go to sleep .
hi , dad . dad , this is jessica .	it 's nice to meet you , jessica .
dad , this is amazing . if you play this backwards , it says `` paul is dead . ''	i know .
it was sinking .	what was ?
our house . there was water coming in all the windows .	you 're worried we 're going to be all right . we 're going to be all right . i remember sometimes you 'd have nightmares as a baby . your mom would hold you and rock you and sing you a song .
bye bye blackbird .	is that what she used to sing ?
i miss her . what do you think happens to someone after they die ?	i do n't know .
like do you believe in heaven ?	i never did . or the whole idea of an afterlife . but i do n't know any more . i have these dreams about ... your mom ... and we have long talks about ... about you , and how you are , which she sort of knows but i tell her anyway . so what is that ? it 's sort of an afterlife , is n't it ?
i 'm starting to forget her .	i know . but she 's here , jonah . because i have you . and as long as i have you , i have your mom .
i ... uh ... have a date with someone friday night .	good .
this one 's for both of us .	sleepless and son . baltimore .
great .	i look stupid . i look stupid , do n't i ? i look like i 'm trying too hard . i was going to get a haircut but then i thought i 'd look like i just got a haircut .
this is a good letter , dad .	the heels on these shoes are very large . why have i never noticed this ? the heels on these shoes are grotesque .
her name is annie . annie reed .	now i 'm late . bye .
listen to this --	not now , jonah --
just this one part , okay ? `` i have been an excellent third-baseman for as long as i or anyone else can remember , and i guarantee you will not get one past me ''	jonah , i 'm leaving --
dad !	everyone thinks brooks robinson is the greatest .
it 's a sign .	oh , right .
here is seattle . and here is baltimore . case closed .	she does n't want us to go to baltimore . she wants to meet us in new york city on valentine 's day . on top of the empire state building .
i figure we could go to new york , catch the knicks , and since we 'd be there anyway , obviously we 'd go to the empire state building --	there she is .
why is she bringing that bag ?	she 's going to cook something for us ?
okay , tiger . time for bed .	it 's only ten o'clock .
jonah !	okay .
thank victoria for dinner .	thanks for dinner . i never saw anybody cook potatoes that way .
do n't ever do that again .	i thought i saw a black widow spider .
what are you doing up ?	i was thirsty .
there 's a bathroom upstairs .	the water tastes better in the kitchen .
did you call that radio station again ?	no .
everyone at work heard you .	i just called for a second .
long enough to call victoria a ho .	it 's a short word .
this is not a joke . thank god victoria does n't know . it would really have hurt her feelings .	if she knew , she 'd never forgive me . it would be hopeless for the two of you .
jonah , this is n't fair . you do n't know victoria . i hardly know her myself . she is , in fact , a mystery to me . she tosses her hair a lot . why does she do this ? i have no idea . is it a twitch ? does she need a haircut ? should she use barrette so it does n't keep falling in her face ? these are things that i 'm willing to get to the bottom of , and that is why i am dating her . that is all i am doing . i am not marrying her . can you appreciate the difference ? that 's what single people do , they try people on and they see if they fit . but nobody fits perfectly , everyone is an adjustment .	was mom an adjustment ?
god , she 's beautiful .	victoria ? she 's okay .
dad , i was talking to jessica about reincarnation , and she thinks that probably you knew annie in another life .	who is annie ?
the reason i know this and you do n't is that i 'm younger and purer so i 'm more in touch with cosmic forces .	i sincerely hope you are not going to marry jessica .
have you seen my wallet ?	it might be in the kitchen .
i 'm only going to be away one night , okay , and clarise will be here . you 'll have a swell time . you 'll watch a little geraldo , some nightmare on elm street 12 , i 'll never know .	are you going with her ?
i have to have a life . i have to do things that i want with people my own age . it 's none of your business who i am going out with . i do n't give a good goddam if you 're angry --	this is the one i like .
fine . i wo n't say anything . you can marry count dracula .	thank you , jonah . but the point is , i am not asking permission .
what 's wrong with annie ?	shut up .
shut up ? shut up ? ? ? mom never did that . mom never said shut up to me . mom never yelled at me .	this conversation is finished .
you said we could go to new york .	did not .
did too .	i ca n't know what i said , but we 're not going .
i 'm not leaving this room until you say yes .	get out .
no .	goddammit , i am sick of this --
what if i could n't get to you ?	i was scared of what you were gon na do .
when i found you ?	if i did n't go .
listen , have i ever done anything really stupid ?	no .
i mean , so far , have i screwed it up for you ?	no .
i ca n't believe you flew first class .	it was all they had .
maybe we 'll get a dog when we get back .	okay .
what do you mean , okay ? would n't you like a dog ?	sure .
hi , sam . and let me guess -- you must be jonah .	hi . he should book now because we can get an excursion fare . jessica 's parents are travel agents and --
do you like baseball ?	yes , i do . in fact , my firm has box seats for the mariners . why do n't we all go next week ?
what about camping ?	what about it ?
do you like it ?	i went camping once . i love to brush my teeth in a brook and floss with a weed .
sure . i 'd really like that . thank you so much .	well ...
hi .	hi . sam ?
yes ?	you must be jonah .
we live two piers over , do n't we ? number 12 , right ? we 're having like a really neat open house today from like four to whenever if you care to stop by .	thanks , but ... we 've got plans .
five minutes in the microwave . any one of them , five minutes and done . ready to eat . do you know how to make juice ?	microwave . five minutes .
eventually , in a few months , you 'll start seeing women , you 'll meet someone .	move on . right . that 's what i 'm going to do . in a few months , boom , i 'll be fine , i 'll just grow a new heart .
god , it 's wonderful to see you . where 's greg ?	he 's over at the boat show . he 'll be by later . it 's so beautiful here .
you saw her in the airport and then here ?	i tried to talk to her ... it was like i knew her . weird .
how 's jonah taking it ?	it 'll take him a while to come around . a month ago he called one of those radio call-in shows and told them i needed a wife --
you 're kidding --	now that i 'm seeing someone , it 's a whole other thing .
it 's a little derivative .	what do you mean ?
anyway , victoria 's nice .	would you follow < u > her < /u > through an airport ?
hi .	hi .
you look good .	you look good yourself .
i thought you were never going to call me .	you did ?
i really wanted you to call me , and i thought you were never going to --	you could have called me --
no way . no way i was going to be the first woman you went out with after ... there is no percentage whatsoever in being the first woman anyone goes out with after ...	you < u > are < /u > the first woman i 'm going out with .
oh .	so whatdya say ? i 'll get the check , and i 'll call you in eight months .
we ca n't finish the job . she 's on her sixth painter , now she 's thinking maybe she wants the fireplace rebricked --	i know her pretty well . maybe i could call her --
is he there ?	no . after he was born , every time we started to make love , he would cry . he had an uncanny sense of timing . we really should n't do anything here anyway .
he 's ten .	he 's good at it .
i read an article about this ...	i read the same article ...
it takes time --	absolutely . when i come back , maybe the two of us should spend some time together , on our own . what do you think ?
i told you it would happen . it 's bound to happen when a man works alone !	why did n't you give a warning signal ?
want to go up to your office , mr. alexander ?	naturally . you think i parked here for a cup of coffee ?
you 're welcome to one .	no thanks .
the men would like to know who this gentleman is .	that 's none of their affair .
i mean it . i know your work record . you were in line for foreman when this trouble started -- did you know that ? you had a real future with this company , but you let those reds stir you up . and now they 'll sell you down the river . why do n't you wake up , ray ? that 's your name , is n't it , ray ?	no . my name is quintero . mister quintero .
are you going to let us pass -- or do i have to call the sheriff ?	there 's nothing stopping you .
mornin ' .	how 's it going ?
not so sure about that . letter of the law , you know . all the injunction says is no picketing by miners .	whose side are you on anyway ?
well ?	i 've tried everything but shootin ' 'em down .
you have n't tried locking them up !	you want 'em all arrested ?
got any more ideas ?	i do n't make policy .
take a drink . calm down !	i say we got ta take action . now .
now why do n't you let these gentlemen pass ? do n't you know who 's in that car ?	it 's the paymaster from moscow -- with our gold .
jenkins ai n't no boss . mean we 're gon na let people like jenkins stay here ?	you ca n't send him back to oklahoma . it 'd be inhumane .
how goes it ?	it never ends .
three hours ! just to heat enough water to wash this stuff ! i tell you something . if this strike is ever settled -- which i doubt -- i do n't go back to work unless the company installs hot running water for us . it should 've been a union demand from the beginning .	yeah .
it 's like charley vidal says -- there 's two kinds of slavery , wage slavery and domestic slavery . the woman question , he calls it .	the woman question ?
question , question -- the problem , what to do about 'em .	so ? what does he want to do about 'em ?
he says give 'em equality . equality in jobs , equality in the home . also sex equality .	what do you mean -- sex equality ?
hear you had a little trouble , quintero . defective fuse ? well , you 're all in one piece . so what 's the beef ?	you know the beef . this new rule of yours , that we work alone . we 're taking it up with the super .
super 's busy -- with your negotiatin ' committee .	so much the better .
now wait a minute . super 's the one made the rule . he ai n't gon na give you no helper .	he will if he wants us to go on blasting .
foreman wants to get the ore out . miner wants to get his brothers out . in one piece .	you work alone , savvy ? you ca n't handle the job , i 'll find someone who can .
who ? a scab ?	an american .
i checked the drift just before he blasted . it was all clear ... the man must have been asleep or something .	you were n't even there . you were back at the station . kalinsky told me ...
are you sick , mama ?	no , estellita .
are you sad ? are we going to church ? for your confession ?	later . when i finish the ironing .
mama , can i put the candles ...	hush ... not a word about the cake , hear ?
why are they singing , mama ?	they are singing for me .
can we light the candles now ? on the cake ?	yes . we will light the candles .
to the mine ?	sure . where they 're negotiating . in the company office . we 'll go up there and picket the place .
come on , esperanza -- how about it ? we got to .	no . no . i ca n't . if ramn ever found me on a picket line ...
he ca n't drink this milk . it 'll make him sick . he 's on a formula . i was a fool ! i should n't have kept him with me .	do n't you worry . we 'll get some action .
it 's all set . consuelo 's squad can take they day off tomorrow . we 're taking over .	good . come in , we 'll work it out . sit down , sit down .
so they had a little taste of what its like to be a woman ... and they run away .	with ramn it 's ... pride . i spoke out of the bitterness in me . and he was hurt .
we 're only one payment behind . i argued with her . it is n't right .	it is n't right , she says . was it right that we bought this ... this instrument ?
but you had to have it , did n't you ? it was so nice to listen	i listen to it . every night . when you 're out to the beer parlor .
where you going ?	got to talk to the brothers .
this water 's cold again .	i 'm sorry . the fire 's gone out .
forget it .	forget it ? i chop wood for the stove five times a day . every time i remember . i remember that across the tracks the anglo miners have hot water in pipes . and bathrooms . inside .
we did . it got lost in the shuffle .	what ?
we ca n't get everything at once . right now we 've got more important demands .	what 's more important than sanitation ?
first we got to get equality on the job . then we 'll work on these other things . leave it to the men .	i see . the men . you 'll strike , maybe , for your demands -- but what the wives want , that comes later , always later .
now do n't start talking against the union again .	what has it got me , your union ?
esperanza , have you forgotten what it was like before the union came ? when estella was a baby , and we could n't even afford a doctor when she got sick ? it was for our families ! we met in graveyards to build that union !	all right . have your strike . i 'll have my baby . but no hospital will take me , because i 'll be a striker 's wife . the store will cut off our credit , and the kids will go hungry . and we 'll get behind on the payments again , and then they 'll come and take away the radio ...
is that all you care about ? that radio ? ca n't you think of anything except yourself ?	if i think of myself it 's because you never think of me . never . never . never ...
stop it ! the children are watching . stop it !	never ... never ... never !
i did not mean to weep again . why should i weep for joy ?	i 'm a fool .
was it expensive , the beer ?	antonio paid for it .
forgive me ... for saying you never thought of me .	i did forget . lus told me .
what 's the matter ?	it 's nothing . just a little catch ...
mother of god ... have mercy ...	have mercy on this child ... let this child live ...
a fighter , huh ?	he was born fighting . and born hungry .
drink , drink , juanito . you 'll never have it so good .	he 'll have it good . some day .
what were they saying ? about you ? in there ?	they say i am no good to you .
you are no good to me -- in jail .	i 'd lie on my cot in the cell and i could n't sleep with the bugs and the stink and the heat . and i 'd say to myself , think of something nice . something beautiful . and then i 'd think of you . and my heart would pound against the cot for love of you .
not just juanito . you 'll have it good too , esperanza . we 're going to win this strike .	what makes you so sure ?
let them take it !	over my dead body .
i do n't want your dead body . i do n't want you back in jail either .	but it 's yours . i wo n't let them ...
it 's not fair ... i should be there with them . after all , i 'm the one who got the women the vote .	no .
but the motion passed . it 's ... it 's not democratic of you to ...	the union do n't run my house . those anglo dames stirred you up to make fools of yourselves -- but you do n't see any of them down there .
yes , i do . there 's ruth barnes .	she 's the organizer 's , wife . she 's got to be there .
no , she wants to be there . and there 's mrs. kalinsky .	there 's jenkins ' wife . you do n't see her on no picket line .
anglo husbands can also be backward .	can be what ?
you all right ?	sure .
must 've been some experience for you , huh ?	yes .
i guess you got enough today to last a lifetime , huh ?	i 'm going back tomorrow .
you might get hurt . listen , if you think i 'm gon na play nursemaid from now on , you 're crazy ... i 've had these kids all day !	i 've had them since the day they were born .
i 'm telling you . i do n't stay home with these kids tomorrow .	okay . then , tomorrow , i take the kids with me to the picket line .
how do you feel ?	i 'm okay . but it 's nice to be home .
four nights . how did you sleep ?	we raised such a fuss they finally brought cots in .
did you have to sign a pledge ? not to go back to the line ?	no , no ... we would n't do it .
but if you go back they 'll lock you up again .	no , no ... the sheriff had enough of us . we drove him crazy .
we 've got to have a talk , you and me .	all right , but later . i 've got a meeting now .
a meeting ?	yes . to plan for the picket line tomorrow .
i waited up till midnight .	you were n't waiting for me .
that meeting only lasted ten minutes . the first night i 'm home , and you run to the beer parlor . what is it ? ca n't you bear the sight of me ?	be still ...
tell me .	we ca n't go on this way . i just ca n't go on living with you . not this way .
where are you going ?	hunting .
when ?	sun up .
alone ?	no .
ramn -- you ca n't .	why not ? i 'm not needed here .
but you are needed . especially now -- with most of the other men away . you 're captain of the stand-by squad .	sure , the standby squad . stand-by for the funeral .
whose funeral ? we 're doing all right . there has n't been a scab near the picket line for three days .	and you know why ? because the company knows they can starve us out -- even if it takes another two , three months . what 's it to them if the mine 's shut down a little longer ?
it 's a lot to them . they 'd do anything to open that mine .	aah ! they 've got other mines . you do n't see the larger picture . they 've got millions . millions . they can outlast us , and they know it .
you mean you 're ready to give up ?	who said anything about giving up ? i 'll never go back to the company on my knees . never .
ramn were not getting weaker . we 're stronger than ever before . they 're getting weaker . they thought they could break our picket line . and they failed . and now they ca n't win unless they pull off something big , and pull it off fast .	like what ?
i do n't know . but i can feel it coming . it 's like ... like a lull before the storm . charley vidal says ...	charley vidal says ! do n't throw charley vidal up to me !
charley 's my friend . i need friends . why are you afraid to have me as your friend ?	i do n't know what you 're talking about .
no , you do n't . have you learned nothing from this strike ? why are you afraid to have me at your side ? do you still think you can have dignity only if i have none ?	you talk of dignity ? after what you 've been doing ?
yes . i talk of dignity . the anglo bosses look down on you , and you hate them for it . `` stay in your place , you dirty mexican '' -- that 's what they tell you . but why must you say to me , `` stay in your place . '' do you feel better having someone lower than you ?	shut up , you 're talking crazy .
whose neck shall i stand on , to make me feel superior ? and what will i get out of it ? i do n't want anything lower than i am . i 'm low enough already . i want to rise . and push everything up with me as i go ...	will you be still ?
this is what we 've been waiting for .	what are you saying ?
why did n't you support her ? you 're the worst of the lot .	but honey ...
we ca n't think of them just as housewives -- but as allies . and we 've got to treat them as such .	look who 's talking ! the great white father , and world 's champion of women 's rights .
aw , cut it out , ruth .	me , i 'm a camp follower -- following this organizer from one mining camp to another -- montana , colorado , idaho . but did he ever think to organize the women ? no . wives do n't count in the anglo locals either .
do n't horse me . price of zinc 's never been higher . they do n't want no strike -- not with their war boom on .	then why 's the company hanging tough ? they 've signed contracts with other locals -- why not this one ?
because most of us here are mexican- americans ! because we want equality with anglo miners -- the same pay , the same conditions .	exactly . and equality 's the one thing the bosses ca n't afford . the biggest club they have over the anglo locals is , `` well -- at least you get more than the mexicans . ''
hear those deputies slugged 'cente .	yeah . lots of provocation lately . they figure if they can lock up the leadership on some phony riot charge , maybe they can bust the strike .
go on . spill it .	well , you 're the organizer . you work out strike strategy -- and most of the time you 're dead right . but when you figure everything the rank-and-file 's to do down to the last detail , you do n't give us anything to think about . you afraid we 're too lazy to take initiative ?
you know i do n't think that .	maybe not . but there 's another thing ... like when you came in tonight -- i heard you ask your wife , `` who 's that ? his grandfather ? ''
that 's all right -- it 's no secret . my name 's hartwell . i 'm from the company 's eastern office .	you mean delaware ?
no . new york .	new york ? you 're not the company president by any chance ?
no ...	too bad . the men 've always wanted to get a look at the president . but you 've come out here to settle the strike ?
well , if that 's possible ...	it 's possible . just negotiate .
what are you doing here ? something wrong with mama ?	i thought maybe you forgot ...
forgot what ?	it 's mama 's saint 's day .
lus ! come down here !	papa ! we seen 'em ! two scabs ! over there !
where 's your mama ?	she 's coming . charley vidal gave her a lift .
boy ! did you see the way mama whopped that deputy with her shoe ? knocked the gun right out ...	i do n't want you hanging around there , hear ?
papa , ca n't i leave now ? there 's a meeting of the junior shop stewards ...	the what !
the junior shop stewards . there 's lots of ways we can help .	do n't i have enough troubles without them shipping you off to reform school ?
but papa -- you need all the help you can get .	you 've got to help around the house !
but you 've got me doing everything . mama never used to make me dry the ...	you should have helped her without being asked .
ramn ... listen for the love of god ...	you ... you ... i 'd expect it of an anglo , yes ... but you ...
ramn ... listen to me ... i 'm in a jam ... i had to get a job ...	you judas ... blood-sucker ...
ramn -- listen my kids ...	t ! traidor a tu gente ! rompehuelga ! desgraciado !
my kids do n't have enough to eat !	you think my kids have enough to eat , you rat ?
i know , it 's wrong . just let me go . i 'll leave town ... just let me go .	you think i was going to work you over ? i would n't dirty my hands with you ...
but you do n't pull a strike when the bosses want it -- so they can smash your union . you wait till you 're ready , so you can win .	do the bosses wait ? no sanitation . so my kids get sick . does the company doctor wait ? twenty bucks . so we miss one payment on the radio i bought for my wife . does the company store wait ? `` pay -- or we take it away . '' why they in such a hurry , the bosses ' store ? they 're trying to scare us , that 's why -- to make us afraid to move . to hang on to what we got -- and like it ! well , i do n't like it i 'm not scared ... and i 'm fed up -- to here !
and another thing . your attitude toward anglos . if you 're gon na be a leader ...	what attitude ?
you lump them all together -- anglo workers and anglo bosses .	he 's a guest in my house , is n't he ?
sure . but you want the truth ? you 're even suspicious of him .	maybe . i think he 's got a few things to learn about our people .
what you want to do is go back the way you came and make a left at the bottom . it 'll take you right to the highway .	that 's it ?
are you australian ?	no .
you got a bathroom i can use before we hit the road ?	yeah ? first door on the right . it ai n't that dirty . just kinda ' filthy is all .
no , i do n't mind . that 's how come i told you about it .	i was talking to my wife .
bobby ?	shhh .
what ?	the spiders .
jimmy , jimmy , jimmy , jimmy . rhymes with simmy .	yeah .
what can i do for you ?	um , coupla ' eight balls oughta do us .
what ?	come on . ease off the girl .
fuck man . come on , bobby .	bobby , bobby , bobby . rhymes with ...
all i saw was the headlights . the high beams were on .	not even a guess ?
yeah , but he was in silhouette .	how about in the house ?
they were wearing ski masks . i told you all of this .	did you see his hair color ?
what is it ?	nothing , i 'm trying to remember ...
ride 'em cowboy )	you like that ?
who would n't ?	first rate , ai n't it ?
i wan na do a small buy first . ten thousand . we 'll see how it goes .	why ? the guys is ready to deal now .
because i do n't know him and i do n't really know you , partner .	now that 's down-right insulting .
i guess i do n't have a hell of a lot of choice .	get used to it . you 're in a very tenuous position on the food chain , hoss .
yeah .	everything go ?
yeah .	just make sure you come alone . this guy wo n't like any surprises
i ai n't a idiot , asshole .	i 'll see you tonight .
look ... i 'd like to help you out ... but i really do n't want to get involved .	i understand . thanks anyway .
jesus , i look like a raccoon .	i was thinking alice cooper .
oh god .	come on , cheer up . it could be worse .
how ?	i do n't know ... . you could be staking your financial future on stealing bob hope 's stool specimen .
what about the guy on the very bottom ?	leave me out of this .
could be worse . oh sorry , forgot who i was talking to .	ouch .
do n't worry , he 's probably passed out with his head in the toilet by now .	this man sounds like a real catch .
oh , he 's a keeper all right .	colette ...
what ?	nothing .
go ahead .	look , it 's really none of my business but why do n't you just dump this guy ?
it 's not that easy .	do n't tell me , down deep he 's really not a bad person and you do n't want to see him get hurt .
who the fuck are you , dr. joyce brothers ? i hate the son-of-a-bitch .	then leave .
i ca n't .	why not ?
you do n't understand .	there 's nothing to understand . the guy is a pig .
i ca n't leave .	you get off on abuse or something ?
fuck you .	then why do n't you leave ? just give me one good reason .
why do n't you call the cops ?	why ? they do n't hold him for more than a day or two .
that 's long enough to get out of town .	i ca n't . i 've got a kid . she lives with my parents . quincey knows where they live .
then make sure he gets put away for longer .	how ?
oh . hi .	what happened to your eye ?

no , you 're wrong , i tried to tell myself the same thing but i could have gotten up . i could have done something .	they would have killed you too .
really , i do n't want to .	i want to do this for you . i want to do something good for a change .
what is it ?	never mind . just do what i say . he holds out the baggie . colette backs away .

colette , go .	i do n't want to leave you .
i knew that if these were the guys i was looking for , i 'd have to set up a deal so sweet , they would n't be able to walk away from it .	that 's when he called me . he told me his story and he pitched me a plan .
how you holding up ?	i 'm fine . little nervous ... little disappointed that i did n't finish this myself .

maybe i am dealing with it .	i know it 's not my place to pass judgement on you but ...
i 'm genuinely happy that you found some peace , nancy . but you ca n't forgive for liz . no one can . and you ca n't forgive for me .	your hatred makes them stronger and you weaker .
i do n't buy that . there 's a place for hatred . did you know that liz and i got into an argument the night she was killed ? i acted like an ass and i never had a chance to apologize to her . do you know what that feels like ?	it 's not too late to show her you 're sorry .

hey , why do you need a gun and a vest anyway ?	personal protection . it 's a dangerous world we live in , jimmy , a very dangerous world .

yeah , that 's what i mean . where the hell does this guy live anyway ?	palmdale
why do they call him pooh-bear ?	i think on account of his nose .

was he the president ?	yes , jimmy
danny ?	yes , jimmy .
what 's this ?	tem thousand dollars . everything i could spare . it 's for you .

jimmy , look , there 's something i have to tell you .	hey , check it out ...

what ?	i 'm not a tweaker . i do n't use drugs . i never had .
but ... i 've seen you .	when ? when did you ever see me use ?
this is n't like that queen elizabeth question , is it ?	you ever notice how i always showed up , in the middle of a binge ? left before it was over ? how i sneak away for cap-naps ? how when the crank came around to me , i always said i 'd just done one ?
no one ever noticed ?	are you kidding me ? a bunch of amped -out tweakers ? it was easy .
but ... why ? why would you pretend ?	i ca n't tell you .
you do n't trust me ?	i do n't trust anybody .
wait if you do n't trust me , why did you tell me that stuff about not using drugs ?	because i do n't want to see you end up like kujo and those other losers . i thought that maybe if you knew that i did n't use , you might see it in yourself to go clear .
i do n't know ... a little . i wish you would have let me in on it from the beginning .	i 'm sorry . i could n't .
nah ... i want to keep it . maybe i can use it for like , inspiration ... you know ... like when i detox ?	good for you jimmy .
would n't be a favor if you were paying me . i 'll just take my five when the deal is done .	you 're a good man . jimmy the finn .
then why do n't i see any pictures of me up there ?	that was my idea .
by not disgracing her memory !	what does that mean ?
you do n't understand .	understand what ?
i 'm gon na get this developed and send it to the warren commission .	um , i think the warren commission has been closed for a while .
yeah , i uh , have a buyer who 's looking for about a quarter 's worth .	crank or glass ?
i 'm sorry . would you like a taste ?	no , i 'm good .
not bad .	secret recipe .
can we talk price ?	make me an offer .
i do n't know , 14,000 a kilo ?	i deal in u.s. pounds , friend . none of that faggot metric crap for me .
okay ... how about um .. 6,000 a ounce .	hey , okay .
you 're serious ?	anything for a dear friend .
but i just met you .	but you 're a friend of jimmy 's . i think of you as a brother already .
so that 's 40 lbs . at 6 a pound then ?	if you say so .
maybe you 're the one who is n't taking me seriously .	why do you say that ?
i welcome you here with open arms and you got the nerve to low-ball me like some slick used car salesman .	hey , i was just trying to ...
i want to tell you about the last guy who tried to jam me up on a deal .	hey , i do n't play that .
you want to do this some other time ?	pull your pants down .
i 'm sorry ?	pull your motherfucking pants down .
come on , guys ...	big bill .
pooh-bear . come on , man . what is this ? it 's me , danny . i thought we had a deal .	big bill
captain steubing thinks you might work for the police .	what ? !
do n't address me . i did n't make the accusation .	please .. i do n't know what you 're ...
shoot him .	okay ! okay !
now get talkin '	i did n't fucking do anything ! i swear to god !
can i pull my fucking dick out ? !	yeah .
i ought to just call this whole thing off right now .	do n't do that . please . or i 'll kill you . please , danny .
what the hell was that ? who told you i was five-0 ?	no one . it was just a test . i need to be sure of who i 'm dealing with from time-to-time .
did it ever occur to you that someone might cop to something they did n't do rather than have their balls chewed off by a rabid weasel ?	i 'll keep that in mind .
what the hell is this ?	just some buddies .
this is bullshit . you did n't say anything about anybody else being here .	what the fuck are you gon na do about it , dickhead ?
cool it . we got business .	yeah , dickhead .
i 've got a hot one .	you go , boy .
feeling the paranoia tonight , are we ?	well , you know what they say , just because you 're paranoid , does n't mean everyone 's not out to slice your balls off and shove 'em down your throat .
you got a name ?	bobby , rhymes with hobby .
what ?	never mind . dude had a backfull of jailhouse tatts .
no last name ?	it was all pretty informal . did n't have a lot of time to exchange pleasantries .
yeah . pretty sure . oh yeah ... he had a spear gun , too .	god damn , flynne , you are one observant tweaker .
danny , i 'm touched .	do n't be . i 'm worried about the kid .
you think i 'm a judas ?	hard to compare the people you 're taking down with the lord .
garcetti thinks i 'm a pile of shit .	garcetti thinks everything is shit . he does n't even like dolphins .
thanks for not judging me .	it 's not my place .
do n't you wonder why i do it ?	the money ? the drugs ? keeping yourself out of jail ? i know the drill .
you do n't find that repugnant ?	just the way the world works . look , as far as tweakers go , you are n't a bad guy . you never hurt anyone but yourself as far as i know .
tell that to bobby ... and his wife and kid .	bobby laid his own tracks . he could have gone quietly but he played the hard-ass con till the end . and as far as i 'm concerned , he wife and kid are a hell of a lot better off without him . now take the money .
i was getting to it .	tell me what ?
if he finds out it 's me , i 'm a dead man .	danny , he is n't gon na find out it 's you . domingo was a slinger , he must have sold to hundreds of different people .
look , we 'll talk to the a.d.a .	when ?
what the hell are you doing here ?	question is , what are you doing here ?
i was trying to score some dope .	cut the shit , flynne .
someone want to tell me what the hell is going on here ?	okay , asshole , you wan na play , we 'll play .
you think this is funny motherfucker ?	i ca n't help it , tanner , you hit like a fucking girl .
i met the guy at a party . he said he wanted to do a biggie . he 's new in town so i offered my services .	this chink have a name ?
you better not be blowing smoke up my ass , flynne .	after that ass-whipping you gave me ?
what 're your taking down ?	standard vig . minus five for a certain blabber-mouth moron by the name of jimmy the finn , who 's living proof that natural selection is a flawed theory .
did you really think you were slick enough to pull this off ?	look man , i just wanted to make some dough and disappear . i did n't want to wait around for domingo to figure out who doubled back on him .
you 've got no choice .	whata you mean i 've got no choice ?
well , if you 'd rather do a stretch in la casa grande ...	for that old possession charge ? gim me a break .
bullshit . he 's a liar .	news-flash , tanner . i 'm a fucking rat .
that 's because he does n't have one .	whata you mean ? he told me -
guy scores dope and dollar from ripping off other drug dealers . as least that 's what the word is .	what 's to stop him from just ripping me off then ?
what ? is it bad ?	i 'm afraid so , danny .
that 's real sweet , garcetti . thanks .	we got the 411 on your good old boy .
murder . beautiful .	pumped fifty-seven bullets into a police informant .
took a pig-slicker to the heart .	jesus .
i thought you 'd be happy .	yeah .
danny ?	my name is tom .
whatever you say , man . look ... can we talk about this ?	yeah . okay . listen carefully ... you 're in the bathroom . you 've been shot in the shoulder ...
please ... do n't do this ...	answer the fucking question !
this the guy ?	it speaks !
that 's him . he 's a lot prettier in person though .	cut to the fucking chase , flynne .
dude is bugging . transparent spiders , plastic men - the whole nine yards .	what 's he holding ?
then why did n't you help the kid when you were there ?	hey , you want me to do all your work for you , numbnuts ?
i 'll tell you why you did n't help - because you 're a chickenshit tweaking snitch . you 're a bottom feader , flynne .	garcetti , you 're teeth , they 're fucking perfect .
danny , it 's really pains me to have to tell you this , but do you remember domingo , that wetback you helped us put away for trafficking a few months back ?	yeah . what about him ?
turns out he 's connected .	to who ?
the mexicali boys	and what does this have to do with me ?
he knows somebody ratted him .	what ? !
fuck you , garcetti . i been at this for almost a year . i 've done everything you guys have asked of me .	anyone ever ask you to be such a disrespectful smart-ass all the time ?
we know what 's going on .	i still do n't know what you 're talking about .
jimmy ?	who the hell is jimmy ?
he 's the only one i told .	and he probably only told two people and they probably only told four people and on and one . you know better than to tell a secret to a tweaker , flynne . might just as well broadcast it on the evening news .
what 's on the other end of this thing ?	now that i can help you with . nasty boy ... goes by the name of pooh-bear . he 's a chef . check with palmdale p.d . i 'm sure they 're keeping box scores on the guy .
sounds like you hooked up with some fine citizens , flynne .	oh they 're all that and the proverbial bag of chips .
what 's that smell ?	that would be me .
what 'd you do , piss your pants ?	hell , yes ! what the hell do you expect zapping mr. johnson with that crackler ?
who 'd have thought it ? danny `` chickenshit '' flynne trying to go large right under our noses .	lay off , garcetti . i 'm not in the mood .
excuse me ?	several possession charges , but nothing major .
why does n't palmdale p.d . just raid the guy ?	they have . but they never found a lab .
you 're lucky , flynne .	funny , i do n't feel lucky .
we 're coordinating with palmdale p.d.. we 'll have your sorry ass covered .	what if he caps me before you can make a move ?
speaking of which ... you run that license plate for me ?	you mean the menacing red car ?
come on ! who is it ? domingo 's boys ?	worse . much worse . a teacher .
when is the deal going down ?	i 'm making the small buy tonight ... if i do n't get beaten to death with a wheelchair or something . if everyone is happy , we 'll do the big deal later in the week .
you know , i 'm starting to think i 'd rather take my chances with domingo than go through any more of this shit .	did n't you hear ? domingo 's dead .
nervous ?	with you clowns watching my back ? what do you think ?
a virtuoso rendition . tom van allen is nothing short of dazzling in his interpretation of miles davis ' haunting , moody piece .	thank you . thank you very much .
and he has a really hot ass with hardly any hair on it .	again , i thank you .
you , madam , are a heartless wench .	and you 've got wiener breath .
really ?	it 's that disgusting hot dog you had for lunch .
tom , let 's spend the night here .	there 's no motels around here .
why did n't you just ask for directions back there ?	come on , where 's your pioneer spirit ?
you mean like the donner party ?	hey , do you think you could eat me if you had to ? and if so , which part do you think you would find the most delicious ?
tom , quit fucking around .	okay , okay . there 's a house up there . i 'll go ask for directions .
you think that 's a good idea ?	what do you mean ?
first you want me to ask for directions , then you do n't . which is it ?	i wanted you to ask back there . you know , before you got us lost .
just no pleasing you , is there ?	just admit you 're wrong .
we all know how much you like hearing that . okay , liz , i was wrong . there . you happy ?	quit feeling sorry for yourself , tom . it gets old .
no . you know what gets old ? being reminded what a loser you are every time you screw up .	here it comes , poor tom .
but that 's okay , liz , you 're the one with the steady job , you pay all the bills . i 'm just an unemployed musician . you have every right .	that is so unfair .
my sentiments exactly .	why are you doing this ?
you thinking what i 'm thinking ?	yeah . this could be the one we 're looking for .
and believe me , word will get out that you 're a pro rat .	that 's not good in prison . it 's just not good .
golly , i had n't thought of that .	do n't we always take good care of you ?
she 's 57 and she 's been teaching third grade for the last 33 years .	now that 's scary !
we 're in business .	good work , flynne . you 're a first-rate rat .
just make sure you hit the floor when we come in . it could get ugly in there .	yeah , i 'd hate to shoot you by accident .
where 's bubba ?	maybe he is n't showing .
danny , listen up . here 's the deal ... my wife 's pimp knows a guy who works at cedars sinai medical lab . they 're getting a very special delivery a week from this friday .	what is it , drugs ?
what is that ? rum and coke ?	do n't worry about it .
i just want to be straight on the details . can i taste it ?	no , you ca n't taste it . it 's the fucking lab ! now shut up .
jesus jimmy , you at the alpha team .	i thought you were done .
find a chaplain .	... alright , let me know when .
report .	sector four is secured , we put out the last three german one-fifty-fives , found them about two miles in from ponte du hoc .
resistance ?	a company , wehrmacht , no artillery , we took twenty-three prisoners , turned them over to intelligence .
casualties ?	fourty-four , twenty one dead .
they did n't want to give up those one-fifty-fives , sir .	it was a hard assignment , that 's why you got it .
yes , sir .	where are your men now ?
pinned down , a mile east of here , waiting for some help from the navy guns .	i 'm sending simpson to take over for you , the division is going to caen , you 're not coming with us , i have something else for you .
sir ?	there 's a private james ryan who parachuted in with the hundred-and- first near ramelle . i want you to take a squad up there . if he 's alive , bring him back to the beach for debarkation . take whoever you need , you 've got your pick of the company .
a private , sir ?	he 's the last of four brothers , the other three were killed in action . this is straight from the chief of staff .
but , sir ... i ... i ...	spit it out , captain .
alright , i 'll give you that . continue .	the numbers do n't make sense , sir . his brothers are dead , that 's too bad , but they 're out of the equation . sending men up there is bleeding heart crapola from three thousand miles away . one private is simply not worth a squad . colonel anderson this one is . he 's worth a lot more than that . which is why i 'm sending you , you 're the best field officer there is .
good luck , john .	thank you , sir .
so , where are you from ?	you writin ' a book or somethin ' ?
as a matter of fact , i am .	figured .
i 'm jackson . i 'm from west fork , tennessee . my pappy 's a preacher . him and his two brothers got a ministry , the blessed church of the wandering gospel .	in west fork ?
in the back of a nineteen and thirty- one stretch hudson with a big ole ' trailer .	no kidding .
i do n't make jokes about things of , or related to , the preaching of the holy gospel , including the ministerial calling of my family .	so they travel around from place to place and preach ?
we got us a tent , forty-two feet across , eighteen feet at center , hundred-and-ten foldin ' chairs . circuit 's eleven towns , covers all 'a hasset county and most 'a weller county . i expect that upon completion of my military service i will be joinin ' said ministry .	what about the captain ? where 's he from ?
thirty-ought-six , norton long-barrel with dual-groove , parallel rifling , elevated three-glass scope and a single-throw hammer .	the army gave you that ?
yep .	you must be a hell a shot .
that must be four thousand yards .	forty-two-hundred , i figure .
did you see what he did , back there ? he stepped right into the open , so i could get across .	shit , that was no big deal .
jackson ?	hell , no , last time i shot a corporal , cap'n miller near bit my head off .
no one 's gon na win the money for the simple reason that the captain never was a civilian . they assembled him at o.c.s . out of spare body parts from dead g.i. 's . i know this for a fact .	you got somethin ' against the cap'n ?
if we find ryan and he 's still alive , that son-of-a-bitch is gon na carry this goddamned b.a.r . back to the beach for me .	army life is too dang easy , my feet have gone soft . back home , we go out squirrel huntin ' , i walk forever and a day and then some , do n't even raise a blister .
reiben , how many time i got to tell you , i 'm from tennessee .	they got squirrels there , too , right ?
last i knew .	wade , sarge , corporal insect , all of us , hell , i 'll bet even the captain has a mother .
fuck private james ryan , fuck him , just fuck the goddamned son-of-a- bitch .	shut up , will you ?
you shut up , this is the most fucked up mission i ever heard of . goddamned ryan , fuck the little bastard .	just shut up , ryan did n't kill wade .
you know what the best possible thing that could happen is ?	yep , you step on a rusty nail , get lockjaw , never say another word as long as you live .
so , that 's ryan .	looks like a flaming asshole to me .
he 's right , we ca n't shoot him ... well , we could but we 'd get in an enormous amount of trouble . and he 's right about the bridge , it 's a hell of a lot more important than he is .	cap'n ... ?
yes , sir .	of course , sir .
y'all come back .	reiben , are you makin ' fun 'a the way i talk ?
what do you think ?	i think i 'm we got that eighty-eight .
he ai n't half-bad , i guess .	i guess .
he ai n't wade .	nope , he ai n't wade .
well , i 'll be goddamned , i knew it .	like hell , you did .
no kiddin ' ?	what deal ?
me ? i 'm walking with my hound , lucy , it 's about an hour 'fore sunrise and we 're out huntin ' coon . i got me a flask of pure kentucky mash whiskey ...	jackson , how many times i got to tell you , you 're from tennessee .
captain , my feet are most uncomfortable . if i 'd 'a known we was gon na have to walk all the way to ramelle , i never would 'a volunteered for this here mission .	you did n't volunteer , jackson .
sir , i have an opinion on this matter .	i 'd love to hear it .
reiben , i want you to listen closely to jackson . this is the way to gripe . jackson , continue .	yes , sir . it seems to me , sir , that the entire resources of the united states army oughta be dedicated to one thing and one thing only , and that is to put me and this here weapon on a rooftop , smack-dab in the middle of berlin , germany . now i ai n't one to question decisions made up on high , sir , but it seems to me that saving one private , no matter how grievous the losses of his family , is a waste of my god-given talent .
where ?	in the shadow by those two trees .
we left them eighty-eights .	they do n't send planes to put out machine guns . two flank runners with surpressing fire . i 'm going right , whoever goes left has to be fast .
watching .	gives wade the second shot .
what the hell 's the matter with you , jackson ?	sir , i ai n't feeling so chipper on account of wade .
sir , i understand what you 're doin ' , but i respectfully request permission to grieve in my own manner .	you 'll grieve the way i tell you to goddamned grieve . there is no wade , there was one , but he died a long time ago , he 's been dead for so long you can hardly remember his name , you understand ?
sir , i understand . i do n't like it , but i understand .	good , now get your goddamned gear .
not yet .	keep trying .
i 'm in my backyard , lying in my hammock , with my arm around my wife , listening for the sound of breaking glass .	say what , cap'n ?
you see , i 've got the best house in all of addley . it 's not the biggest house , but it 's got the best location , right next to the junior high baseball field . the garage windows face left field . the guy who owned the house before me had these heavy screen s put over them . the first thing i did when i bought the place was take off those screens . two-hundred-twenty- two yards from home plate to my garage windows . it takes a hell of a junior high kid to hit a ball that far . i look at my garage windows as a motivator and a way to scout the kids coming up , the ones who are going to give us a shot at the state championship . i lay there in my hammock and every time i hear the sound of breaking glass , i know we 're one step closer to winning it all .	do n't that get kind of expensive , cap'n ?
it 's worth it .	to each , his own .
sorry , sir , fresh out of trucks , how 'bout a '38 ford roadster , hard-top , red with black interior .	white-walls ?
no white-walls , sir , there 's a war on . not there , you goddamned idiot , over there ! i ca n't help you , sir .	a half-track , anything .
how about that jeep ?	that 's general gavin 's . his lap dog told me if anyone breathes on it , i 'll get busted and if anyone so much as touches it with their little finger , i 'll get court marshaled . if you were to take it , they 'd shoot me .
a paratrooper named ryan . he 's going home , if he 's alive .	senator 's son ?
i know about bracketing . i read about it . the next one is going to land right on us .	forward ! forward ! now reverse !
you can tell all that , just by the sound , sire ?	that 's not all . there were nine gunners on the eighty-eights , one had a broken heel on his boot , two had bratwurst for supper last night , one of them is named fritz , the other , hans , maybe , i do n't know , it 's hard to tell .
glad of it .	on the other side of the street , crouches in a doorway with jackson . upham is a bit in shock , less from the nearness of the bullets than from what miller just did for him .
sir , i 'm sorry about what happened , i ...	it was nothing .
but you could have gotten killed and i ...	like i said , it was nothing . do n't bunch up .
upham ?	pass .
i was n't made for this .	you think the rest of us were ?
it looks like a renoir .	yes . do you know sibelius ' fourth symphony , the normandy ?
i 've been humming it .	i heard .
it seemed appropriate .	you know classical music ?
some .	where are you from , captain ?
over three-hundred .	i 'll tell you what , if i 'm still alive when it hits five-hundred , i 'll let you know and we 'll split the money .
if that 's the way you feel , why do n't we wait until it 's up to a thousand .	i do n't expect to live that long .
five nights ago , he found this paratrooper caught in a tree with a broken leg . the leg got infected . last night he went to ville cholet to get a doctor . the doctor refused to come and when he got back , this is what he found . the krauts must have shown up while he was gone .	did he see any sign of them ?
no , but he heard firing , just east , less that a kilometer .	thank him and tell him we 're sorry about his loss .
what is it ?	a machine gun .
good luck , captain .	do n't need it , i 'm a cat , i 've got five lives .
the men said , nine .	what do they know ? i had nine , but i feel through the ice when i was seven , my brother pulled me out . then i used one when a grenade landed in my foxhole in sicily , it was a dud . i figure one on the beaches , one on the cliffs and two getting here .
that only leaves three .	plenty .
i wonder where they 're going .	same place we are .
i 'd like to stay , too , captain .	you do n't count .
i can tell what the gunners had for dinner .	those guns are close .
what about our grenades ?	those are tigers , they have six-inch armor , they do n't even notice grenades .
would they notice and eighty-eight ?	sure , you got one ?
upham , you 've got to learn the difference between whining and griping . you ca n't just rely on natural ability , you 've got to study and practice .	but , sir ...
there you go again , that 's whining , that 's not okay .	goddamn it , sir ...
what 'd you say , captain ?	i teach english at addley high school in addley , pennsylvania .
captain , what about our deal ?	i changed my mind .
go !	rolls his eyes , takes a breath . scrambles into the gap . the other five right behind .
captain , if your mother saw you do that , she 'd be very upset !	i thought you were my mother .
worked , did n't it ?	you tryin ' to get yourself killed ?
caen ?	i wish . you and i are taking a squad up to ramelle on a public relations mission .
you ? leading a squad ?	some private up there lost three brothers , got a ticket home .
what about the company ?	simpson .
simpson ? jesus christ on a fucking pogo stick !	i want reiben on b.a.r ; jackson with his sniper rifle ; beasley , demolition .
beasley 's dead .	okay , wade . translators ?
fresh out .	what about talbot ?
you get a translator , captain ?	i 've got a line on one .
now we 've got a straight shot , due north , to ramelle , twenty-six miles , two villages between here and there , st. mere , then bernay . we 'll take the jeep as far as we can , then go on on foot .	we in radio contact with anybody up there ?
a fucking mess , two maybe three kraut divisions , no fronts , no lines , the drops were completely fouled up , we 've got little pockets of paratroopers all over the place , trying to hang on . command says we hold st. mere , but north of that , it 's all krauts . even if ryan 's where he 's supposed to be , he 's more than likely dead .	hell of a mission .
uh , captain ...	push !
got it , sir . we gon na go take care of those eighty-eights ?	that 's not what we 're here for .
he 's right , captain , it might be kind of dangerous for those flyboys .	tell that to private james ryan . we 've got our orders . let 's go .
you ever going to open those letters ? miller keeps his eyes on the maps .	maybe .
it 's not normal , not reading letters from home .	since when have things been normal ?
you got me . afraid of bad news ?	nope .
you think they 'll be alright ?	they 're fine . as long as they can gripe , they 'll be alright .
they guys here are n't going to be able to hold out until battalion shows up .	nope .
command is n't going to let them withdraw and the germans sure as hell are n't going to let them surrender .	three for three .
if we stayed , we could make a difference .	you 're kidding yourself .
i hope this boy ryan is worth it .	now you 're the one kidding yourself . hell of a mission .
makes you feel small , does n't it ?	it does n't take this .
a couple of weeks . it started in portsmouth when they brought us down for loading .	is it getting worse ?
no . it comes and goes . it stops when i look at it .	you may have to find yourself a new line of work , this one does n't seem to agree with you anymore .
yeah ? what rule of thumb is that ?	how about i go right , sir ?
how about ... ?	how about you shut up and take your position ?
hold your fire !	rolls to his feet . fire another burst . kills the last of the german riflemen . does n't pause . runs onto the field .
pulls wade 's hands from the wound . pours sulfa powder .	about to pour his sulfa . sees the wound . stops . knows it 's fatal .
shoves the needle into wade 's neck . thick vein . pumps the morphine straight to wade 's brain . motions impatiently to sarge .	more morphine , hurry up , come on , come on ...
hesitates . then drops his sulfa . fumbles in his pack . finds the morphine .	snatches the morphine from sarge . quickly and efficiently prepares a second shot . he 's done this before .
you alright ?	let 's just find someplace .
what was the name of that kid at anzio , the one who got his face burned off ?	vecchio .
yeah , vecchio , i could n't remember his name , he was a good kid , remember how he used to walk on his hands and sing that song about the man on flying trapeze ?	yeah .
you know why i 'm such a good officer ? because of my mother . have i ever told you about her ?	bits and pieces .
she 's the best poker player you ever saw . my father used to go to these saturday night games and lose his shirt . finally , my mother gave him an ultimatum , either she gets a regular seat at the table or she locks him in every saturday night . he squawked and so did his buddies but after a while they gave in and from the first night she sat down , she never lost . she could read those cocky bastards like they were playing open hands . and he bluffs ? he had sixteen levels of bullshit . her eyes , the tone of her voice , her bets , her jokes , the way she sipped her coffee , she was a master . she won more money on shit hands than anyone in the history of the game . every saturday night , my father would lose two , three hundred bucks and she 'd win it all back and then some . and i 'd stand there , glued to her shoulder , from the time i was five years old , watching every hand , every move , studying how she did it . that 's why i 'm such a good officer , i can look at a man 's face and tell you exactly what he 's holding , and if it 's a shit hand , i know just what cards to deal him .	and what about your own hand ?
no problem . a pair of deuces ? less ? so what ? i bluff . it used to tear me apart when i 'd get one of my men killed , but what was i supposed to do ? break down in front of the ones who were standing there waiting for me to tell them what to do ? of course not , so i bluffed , and after a while , i started to fall for my own bluff . it was great , it made everything so much easier . sarge is that why your hand 's been shaking ?	it could be worse . you know the first thing they teach you at o.c.s. ? lie to your men .
oh , yeah ?	not in so many words , but they tell you you can have all the firepower in the world and if your men do n't have good morale , it 's not worth a damn . so if you 're scared or empty or half-a-step from a section eight , do you tell your men ? of course not . you bluff , you lie .
and how do you bluff yourself ?	simple , numbers . every time you kill one of your men , you tell yourself you just saved the lives of two , three , ten , a hundred others . we lost , what , thirty-one on the cliffs ? i 'll bet we saved ten times that number by putting out those guns . that 's over three hundred men . maybe five hundred . a thousand . then thousand . any number you want . see ? it 's simple . it lets you always choose mission over men .
except this time , the mission is a man .	that 's the rub . i liked wade . who 's ryan ? if they 're both standing in front of me and i have to shoot one or the other , how do i choose ? look at my hand , there it goes again .
john , i 've got to tell you , i think you 're about used up .	i think you 're right , keith .
no , but if i get any worse , you 'll have to relieve me .	just what i want to do .
you know wade was the eleventh of the twelve , you 're the last one still alive .	i know .
do n't let yourself get killed , if you do , they might make me give back the medal and then i wo n't be able to lip off to colonels anymore .	i 'll do my best .
thanks for drawing that machine gun off me .	you 're welcome , john .
sarge , see what you can do to make those buildings inhospitable .	yes , sir .
what do you think ?	well , if we had ten times the men and a lot more ammo , we might stand a chance , but not against those tanks .
what are we going to do ?	we 're going to hope like hell the tanks were on their way somewhere else .
uh , oh .	out of the mouth of babes .
reiben , i do n't know what i 'd do without you . sarge , keep ryan close to you and alive .	yes , sir .
captain , can i put in for a transfer ?	sure , meet me at the top , we 'll start the paperwork .
sir , what if they send some other company into caen ahead of us while we 're pinned down here ?	do n't worry , we 're the only rangers this side of the continent , we 've got to be first into caen .
so , you ever heard of employee discounts ? my uncle sells shoes , gets twenty-five percent off everything in the line , got a closet filled with the best looking shoes you ever seen .	just picture some french number been spending all day , every day , making cream-colored , shear-body negligees with gentle-lift silk cups and gathered empire waists , what the hell you think she wears at night ?
reiben , how the hell do you know so much about lingerie ?	lingerie is my life , sir . my mother 's got a shop in brooklyn , i grew up in it , from the time i could crawl , we carry caen lingerie , it 's the best there is , it 's all i been thinking about since the invasion .
there 's a war on , good chance they 're not still making lingerie in caen .	oh , captain , they 'll always make lingerie , it 's one of the three basic needs of man -- food , shelter , silk teddies . miller dream on , private .
i do n't think so , captain .	stay at it until you get fire control . keep 'em down , wait for the navy .
strides through the chaos , avoiding the passing vehicles . he sees his men and walks toward them . reiben hurries up to miller , pleading .	please , sir , you ca n't take me to ramelle , i got ta go to caen , sir , please , i told you , they make caen lingerie there , it 's beautiful , it 's the best there is , it 's ... oh , please , sir ...
sorry , i need a b.a.r . man , you 're the best .	no , i 'm not , kaback is , honest . or what about faulkner ? or that little guy with the glasses ?
trust me , you 're the best .	but , sir ...
captain , can i ask you a question ?	sure , reiben .
captain , i got ta tell you , the irony of this mission is fucking killing me .	yeah , how so ?
i should be on my way to caen , sir . it 's like beethoven , the guy 's one of the greatest composers ever lived and he goes deaf . go figure , i mean , who 'd he piss off ? and here i am , the beethoven of ladies foundation garments , one step away from caen , the center of the known lingerie universe and instead , i 'm going to ramelle to save some fucking private who 's probably already dead .	there 's to be a bright side , look for it .
sir , you know what ramelle is famous for ? cheese . the rest of the company is going to caen and we 're going to the goddamned cheese capital of france . there is no bright side .	there 's always a bright side .
i 'm listening , sir .	well , i , for one , like cheese .
general gavin is going to be very irritated at you , captain .	stands on the edge of the woods , almost in a trance .
jesus christ , he 's a natural !	upham , are you sure you 've never been in combat ?
captain , could you please explain the math of this mission to me ?	sure , what do you want to know ?
well , sir , in purely arithmetic terms , since when does six equal one ? what 's the sense in risking six guys to save one ?	ours is not to reason why .
huh ?	never mind , do n't worry , we 'll pick up this kid , high-tail it back to division , everything 'll work out fine .
i 'd much rather die in caen than ramelle , sir . it 's a personal thing .	reiben , there 's a fairly good chance you 're not going to die at all .
well , maybe not the captain , but the rest of us have mothers .	you have orders , too .
reiben , what 's the matter with you ? i do n't gripe to you . i 'm a captain . there 's a chain of command . griping goes one way , up , only up , never down . you gripe to me , i gripe to my superior officers . up , get it ? i do n't gripe to you , i do n't gripe in front of you . how long you been in the army ?	i 'm sorry , sir , i apologize . but if you were n't a captain , or if i were a major , what would you say ?
in addition , as i pointed out earlier , i have a fondness for cheese and i hope to have the opportunity to sample some of the ramelle products , when we arrive there , to see if they live up to their excellent reputation . moreover , i feel heartfelt sorrow for the mother of private james ryan and i 'm more than willing to lay down my life , and the lives of my men , especially you , reiben , to help relieve her suffering . the men thoroughly enjoy the performance .	sir , if you were not a captain , i would compliment you , now , for being an excellent liar .
any further thoughts on the subject ?	yes , sir , as a final note , i 'd like to say , fuck our orders , fuck ramelle , fuck the cheese capital of france and while we 're at it , fuck private james ryan .
sir , i 've got an idea , let 's go around .	we ca n't leave it here .
goddamn it ... goddamn it ... goddamn it ...	is silent . motionless . he gently closes wade 's eyes . his hand quivers slightly as he unclips one of wades dogtags . he fumbles and drops it . sarge notices .
up . we 're moving out .	i thought you said we had an hour , sir ?
i 've given this a lot of thought , sir . the best thing that could happen is , we find ryan and he 's dead .	why 's that ?
well , sir , consider the possibilities . a : ryan is alive . we have to take him back to the beach . knowing you , you do n't let him carry my gear , even though he really should , and we all get killed , trying to keep him alive .	except for the last part , that one 's not bad .
b : ryan is dead . he 's been blown up by the german equivalent of wade , whose name i know you do n't want me to mention . there 's nothing to find . the biggest piece is the size of a pea . we wander around , looking for him until the germans pick us off , one after another .	i do n't like that one .
neither do i , sir . c : and this is the worst one , we find ryan and he 's wounded . not only does he not carry my gear , we have to carry his gear . and him .	but we accomplish the mission .
maybe . but what if he dies on the way back ? you see what i 'm saying , sir ? the best possible situation is , he 's dead , we find his body , more or less intact , we grab one of his dog-tags and high-tail it back to the beach , or better yet , we head over to caen and catch up with division .	has anyone ever told you , you 're officer material ?
no , sir .	that 's a mystery to me .
scans the germans with his binoculars .	looks like tea time , maybe they 're brits .
looks like they 've been having a hell of a party , here , captain .	on the bridge ! we 're coming in .
i have no fucking idea . here we come . cover me .	what if our guys open up , sir ?
you 're only allowed to shoot at germans , that 's one of the rules .	have it your way , captain .
yes , sir , of course , sir , i was merely speaking hypothetically . if this was a voting situation , then the vote would have been unanimous . but of course , it 's not a voting situation , you 're the captain , and you give the orders , sir .	you 're goddamned right , i give the order . vote ! jesus christ ! listen to me , you little pissant pieces of shit , i am the ranking officer here and what i say goes , is that clear ?
maybe caen .	let 's hope , because we 're sure as hell not going to do any damage to them with what we have here .
leave him to me , captain , i 'll have him pissing and moaning with the best of us .	see to it .
cocks his thompson . settles down behind some sandbags .	here they come !
goddamn it ... goddamn it ... goddamn it ...	get back to your positions !
what deal ?	i coach the baseball team , too .
i wonder if his cabin is still available ?	that 's not where i am . miller no ? where are you ?
hears the faint distant rumble of the tank . barely has time to react . sees :	here they come .
fires a burst . germans drops .	fires a burst . more germans drop .
continues firing . cutting down the advancing germans .	knows what that means . he hears the rumble of the tanks .
goddamn it !	more tanks ... ryan lot 's of them the fear on their faces turns to resignation . they know that they are dead men . they settle into their positions , and prepare to fire and die .
private . i 'm sorry about your brothers but staying here and getting yourself killed is n't going to help .	sir , if the krauts are holding this bridge when division shows up , our guys are going to be sitting ducks .
the hell you are n't , you 're comin ' with me if i have to drag you every inch of the way . you hear me , private ?	i hear you sir , but i 'm not leaving .
thank you , sir .	yeah , yeah . i want you right next to me , no matter where i go , you understand ?
yes , sir .	alright , come with me .
i 'd like to go , sir .	no , private , i want you to stay here , keep your head down , do n't do anything brave or stupid .
do n't do that again .	i wo n't need to sir , it 's already here , behind the barricade so ...
you set ? sarge nods .	yes , sir .
is jumped on by one . upham fires . kills the german .	struggling with a pair of germans .
does n't move . he just stares at sarge 's body .	looks at miller , sees him growing weak , starting to sway . he gently tries to move miller aside .
fires the eighty-eight .	races through the debris . trailed by bullets .
yes , private .	upham and jackson , what were they like ?
upham ? good kid , smart , he was writing a book .	yeah ?
jackson was from west fork , tennessee , he was going to be a preacher , his father and uncles have a traveling ministry out of the back of a stretch hudson .	and sarge ?
so what ? i 've got three satchel charges , six gammon grenades , a dozen- and-a-half pineapples , and all my regular gear . you do n't hear me complaining .	that 's because , as i have pointed out on numerous occasions , you are a happy idiot .
oh , christ , now we got ta listen to that grandfather thing again .	as i was saying , before i was so rudely interrupted , my grandfather got old , as grandfathers tend to do . he needed someone to take care of him . we move around all the time , going from one mine to another , so we had to put him in a home . nice enough place but kind of depressing . but not for granddad . he just convinced himself he was on a cruise ship , going to tahiti , he had his own cabin , first class , with room service . it just so happened that the weather was always lousy , so he never bothered to go up on deck . happiest guy you ever saw until the day he died .
fine , you convince yourself you got a pack full of feathers and goddamned private james ryan can carry my fucking gear .	reiben , you can be very unpleasant to be around sometimes .
you want unpleasant ? just wait , i can do much better than this .	look at upham , you do n't hear him complaining .
wade 's right , it 's some kind of scientific , magnetic thing , i ca n't explain it , but i 've seen it .	we all have , he 's got nine lives , or he 's bulletproof , or some damn thing .
hell , i do n't mind this mission , sir , as long as there 's something up at ramelle for ...	... for you to blow up , yeah , yeah , we heard that .
shit , sir .	fertilizer , captain , i think we 're in a cranberry bog .
who cares ?	i care . do n't you know what caen 's famous for , sarge ?
frogs ?	lingerie .
i usually like surprises .	what are we likely to run into ?
damn fool . sir .	captain , he 's fast !
jesus , reiben , think of the poor bastard 's mother .	hey , i got a mother . jackson , you got a mother ?
so , where are you from ?	get lost .
but everybody 's heard of him , he won the congressional medal of honor , he saved a dozen men .	we know .
sir , i ran the 220 in high school .	he 's fast , captain , i saw him .
on guard , glancing back . pissed off .	goddamn it ... goddamn it ... goddamn it ...
i do n't know , i kind of like wade 's idea about the cruise ship . i 've never been to tahiti .	what about you , captain ?
demolition , right ?	since i was nine years old . they got a lot of explosives around mines . me and my little brother could get into any warehouse you ever saw . damn , we had fun !
how do you do it ?	it 's easy , it runs in my family , take my grandfather , for example ...
you think he really believed it ?	who knows ? it worked .
how fast ?	twenty-four-five .
i 'm supposed to be leaving on a fellowship that i worked for my entire life . i do n't even care . i met this boy over the summer , and i , i ca n't see him because of this , i ca n't talk to him , i ca n't talk to my father about ... i wore these clothes , i thought , i thought that if i looked right and if i acted right then someone would talk to me . but i look awful and i feel awful , could you , could you please talk to me ? be a little decent .	we believe that your father operates in a large pool of cash that comes from phoney billings , phoney patients . we 've been investigating him for five years . we believe that when they die , he takes their money .
pardon me ?	look , why do n't you check it out for yourself ? see if your father fits the profile .
what 's the profile ?	well , take a look around the house . is everything nice , but not too nice ? are there lots of , uh , rugs , pieces of art , stereo equipment , uh , furniture , a lot of things bought with cash ? does he give a lot of gifts ? do the major items in your house cover around the nine thousand-dollar range ?
you 're trying to get me to say something , that 's why you 're telling me all of this .	do n't let your father 's business infect your life .
how can you , how can you say that ?	because he 's guilty .
no , no he 's not .	we have records . we have proof . i 'm sorry to be the one to have to tell you this , but it 's going to get worse . now , if i were you , i would take that fellowship .
jesus . what , i live in a palace , right ? i have guests here .	understanding the following rights ...
speak with my lawyer .	so you refuse to answer my questions ?
just come down to my place of business , for god 's sake . i have people here .	mr court , be aware that we will be contacting a number of your business associates ...
this evening is over .	and your former wife .
the , uh , cynthia branson estate was worth how much ? because her family ...	what family ? we never heard from them . i sold her house for them , made them money .
hmmm . your income , mr court , has n't changed substantially in seventeen years .	that 's right .
why would you stay so long with an operation that is so clearly not a growth enterprise ?	taking care of people is n't a growth enterprise , mr sims . i hope you write that down in your report , i 'd like your bosses to read it .
hi .	is it a gift for your wife ? are you getting a set together ?
no , i 'm not married . it 's for my daughter .	for going to school ?
yeah , she won a fellowship .	good for her .
i 'll take the whole set .	excellent .
thanks , i like yours too .	listen , i do n't know your name , but what are you doing for lunch ?
i 'm sorry , but they turned down your card .	oh yeah , let me give you another card .
keep it .	you 're sure ?
lloyd ?	hey , sis .
it 's no problem . i called mom and dad in germany ; it 's like they were there .	i hope you understand .
why do you eat that stuff ? there 's no food in your food . not too loud , the red line 's there for a reason .	how do you know how to draw the red line anyway ?
because it 's loud enough so the neighbors do n't complain , that 's how come i know .	good thing there 's not a red line on you , j-man . yeah !
why ca n't you be his uncle and not his playmate ?	jesus christ . i get in a good mood . how hard is it just to decide to be in a good mood , and then be in a good mood ?
gee , it 's easy .	look , i 'm really sorry that mom and dad made you take me in . really . if it 's such a big deal , i 'll go . but remember this , it used to be fun . it used to be warped , twisted and hilarious , and i mean that in the best possible way , i mean it as a compliment . i mean , i 'm sorry t-i-m left you . but i am not t-i-m .
i was hilarious once , was n't i ?	yeah .
you 're tough , j-man .	he 's a mess !
i 'll be in my office .	i just washed this shirt , did n't i ?
no , no , do n't go in there .	forget it , forget it , it 's mine , it 's mine !
hello constance . it 's me , lloyd ... nothing , i 'm just driving around ... she broke up with me ... what do i do ? ca n't she come back ? how can i get her back ? ... i ca n't think , talk to me ... i fucked up ... i feel like crying ... she gave me a pen . i gave her my heart and she gave me a pen .	lloyd , honey , just come home , okay ?
that 's unlikely .	the movies are a good second date , you know , as a date ?
but you never had a first date .	yes i did- i sat across from her in a mall . we ate together . we ate , that 's eating , sharing an important physical event .
that 's not even a scam .	what 's a scam ?
then what 's love ?	i 'm gon na call her .
sounds great to me , i 'm going to call her , that 's what 's cool about her .	brains stay with brains . the bomb could go off and their mutant genes would form the same cliques .
look at those eyes .	lloyd , give it up .
do me a favor ; take a picture of me with her .	lloyd .
c'mon , just do it .	c'mon lloyd .
please ?	that 's just so embarrassing .
wait for me for when i get round to the front .	okay , i got it .
you are such a great person lloyd . i 'm a good person , but you are a great person .	hang in there , man .
yes .	see you tomorrow .
did you sleep with her ?	i admit nothing .
alright , alright , alright , calm down , alright , calm down . nothing 's different .	lloyd , listen to me . everything has changed . you 've had sex . no matter what you might think , nothing will ever be the same between you two . you might be sixty . you might be walking down the street , and you 'll talk to her about something , whatever . but what you 'll really be thinking is 'we had sex ' .
so , what 's your point ?	you 've got to do something special . you 've got to make a statement .
alright .	lloyd , send her flowers , write her a letter . something .
what does it say ?	read it .
i draw the line at seven un-returned phone calls .	lloyd , you have to understand her family is being ripped apart . like you and she were ripped apart . like joe and i were ripped apart .
no , you 're not a guy .	i am .
the world is full of guys . be a man . do n't be a guy .	if she wants me , she can come to me .
i do n't feel anything .	come on , it 's graduation .
did you see what mr carroll wrote in my yearbook ? well , he ridiculed me all year long , and then he writes , `` you 're a real live-wire , love mr carroll . '' y'know , it 's all so phoney .	he wants to leave things on a good note .
trapped in the body of a gameshow hostess .	diane court does not realise how good-looking she is .
i would n't get my hopes up lloyd .	i 'm sorry . it 's just you 're a really nice guy , and we do n't want to see you get hurt .
lloyd is doomed .	meaning ?
i told him to be himself .	he 's got that nervous talking thing . i told him not to speak .
lloyd , it 's us .	look at his face , he did the deed .
wait a minute .	you 've got to show her respect , you 've got to show her that you 're not like joe ...
wait a minute .	and above all , just because this happened gives you no right whatsoever ...
you know i just sit here listening , and you never let me talk .	what ? i 'm sorry , talk .
`` dear diane , i 'll always be there for you , all the love in my heart , lloyd . '' i 've never gotten a letter like this , have you ?	i dream about it .
i wrote sixty-three songs this year . they 're all about joe , and i 'm going to play every single one of them tonight .	i just saw joe . he 's here .
why ?	it 's too much pressure , it 's not his crowd .
hey , i know this is a strange thing to say , but maybe diane court really likes lloyd .	if you were diane court , would you honestly fall for lloyd ?
i ca n't give you that . this guy 's been ripping off grandma and grandpa for seventeen years . he 's been getting it from every end . i 'd love to hear his story .	one hundred thousand dollar fine and three months ?
one hundred and twenty-five thousand and nine months .	i can accept that .
and i want to turn the home over to the state .	he 'd like to start serving immediately .
i can put that together .	confirm this with my office and my client .
i 'll put this past my boss	alright .
lloyd , she 's being difficult .	i 'm going to take out diane court again .
that was a mistake . the rain on my car is a baptism . the new me . iceman , power lloyd . my assault on the world begins now . believe in myself , answer to no one ... you probably got it all figured out , corey . if you start out depressed , everything 's kind of a pleasant surprise .	look , why do n't you just call diane again ?
visit her at the home .	i 'm not going back there . i do n't even know who you 're talking about .
lloyd , why do you have to be like this ?	'cause i 'm a guy , i have pride .
well , it 's almost over . we 've gone to school together for three years ... i might cut that part out .	why ? it 's fine . it 's nice .
having taken a few courses at the university this year , i have glimpsed our future , and all i can say is ... go back .	ha ! go back ! what a great line !
you like it ?	oh yeah !
i did n't think anyone would get it .	oh no , no , it 's ... it 's wonderful . it 's ... no , do n't worry about it . you 're very funny . go back , that 's great !
alright , no more , i 'm going to save it .	okay .
ha !	well , it 's almost over . we 've gone to school together for three years , and we 've been through a lot . but with that training out of high school gone , what 's going to happen to us ? we all know what the answers are . we want to be happy , go to college , own a car , maybe raise a family . but what if that does n't happen ? i have , i have to be honest though , i have all the hope and ambition in the world . but when i think about the future , the truth is , i am really ... scared .
dad , you have to teach me to suture this weekend .	okay , i promise i will . just come here a minute , i want to show you something .
what are you doing ?	well , since i 'm not only your father , i 'm also your friend ; i had to get you two presents .
god , that 's ... this is ridiculous .	now this is the only thing your mother ever gave me that i kept . now it 's yours . go ahead , open it .
they really applauded you today honey .	i was standing up there and looking at all the people , and i felt like they did n't know me . i mean , maybe i should n't have taken all those courses out of school , because everybody thinks i ... forget it .
no , wait a minute . everybody thinks you 're what ?	everybody thinks i 'm a priss .
diane , in a million years , you could never be a ... priss . it 's all working out for you honey , do n't you see ? it 's all working out , just like we planned . all the years of summer school , all the vacations you gave up , it 's all working out just the way we planned ...	stop it , stop it , stop it .
i 'm sorry .	i love you dad .
what ?	i just had a phone call .
tell me , is it bad news ?	no , no , just listen . you won the wreath fellowship .
are you kidding ? you 're not kidding ? you 're not kidding !	you won it . you 're going to study at the finest institute at england , the toughest fellowship in the country , and you won .
i won ?	you 're going to take a big step , a big leap , and before you do , i just want one thing from you , miss . you stand up straight and admit you 're special .
god , i 'll have to go on a plane .	we 'll worry about that later . now come on , tell me that you 're special .
do n't do this to me . you 're too good at making me nervous .	no , listen to me . you 're the best in the country , do n't you understand ? it 's like a pyramid . it starts out with everybody , and it narrows through your life and through everything , and all the hoopla and the competition narrows it down to one brilliant person who is so special that they celebrate you on two continents . and it 's you . so tell me something , where 's the flaw in that ? there is no flaw .
morning honey .	dad , i 'm so glad i went . goodnight .
wait a minute . how was lloyd ?	lloyd was such a gentleman . he was funny and nervous and strange , and i met people that i never would have met before , then i blew it . i called him basic . can you believe i did that ?
goodnight .	goodnight .
she 's not the world 's greatest flyer , let me tell you . when she was eight years old , she ...	dad .
well , let me start it . i 'm flying down to los angeles on business , and i decide to take her on her first aeroplane .	i knew how planes flew , but i was still a little nervous .
so anyway , they closed the doors , and she starts to scream . i 've never in my life heard anyone scream quite like that .	and then you got up and you told them to turn the plane around .
which they did . let me finish .	okay , i give up .
oh yeah . there was , uh , somebody on the plane worked in a recording studio , and , uh , we got this telephone call , this guy is making a sound effects record , and he 'd gotten our address and he wanted to know if he could come over and record her scream .	which they did , and every once in a while on a commercial , you can hear me scream .
morning .	dad , i 'm sorry .
you should be .	i was irresponsible , i should have called .
you bet you should have called . you still live at home . do n't make me call the police at three-thirty in the morning , do n't make me call hospitals .	dad , i 'm so sorry . i know this is a bad time .
you 've always called before , always . now i 'm not asking what you did , i just want to know that you 're alright .	i 'm fine .
do you wan na make things easier on me ? now tell me where you were because this is , this is bullshit . you can say anything to me , i hope you still know that .	i know that .
lloyd ?	dad , yes . and i 'm scared to death of what you must think of me right now .
did he ever get rough with you ?	dad , no . but i did n't want any problems , so i decided not to sleep with him .
dad , maybe i should n't go with all that 's happening to you .	you 're going .
but listen , if i had a friend in the same position , i would tell her to delay a year .	you 're going .
it does n't feel right to me . i , i do n't even have the right luggage yet .	bon voyage .
you 're not listening to me .	diane ! alright , let 's stop this right now . let 's not put our energy into something ridiculous . this is n't even smart thinking .
do you love him ?	i like him a lot .
unbelievable . this is a nightmare .	diane , you owe it to yourself to get on that plane with no attachments , no strings , because after you get over there , things are going to change . people change .
dad , you and i have talked about this . lloyd and i have talked about this . believe me , this is well-covered territory .	diane , i 'm not asking you to sever all relations with the boy . give him a present , here , let him know you still care . give him this pen .
dad , in a million years , i would never give him a pen . what 's wrong with having some fun ? i like him .	'i like him ' ? diane , i 'm talking about being honest with people , being decent ...
if i pick it up , we 'll only get back together .	well then do n't pick it up . you know what 's best .
dad , are you okay in there ?	just finishing up in here .
what happened to you ?	dad , did you do it ? did you take that money ?
sweetheart , no . do n't be ridiculous .	swear to god , i need to know the truth .
honey !	swear to god .
i swear to god .	but i found the money .
honey , it 's not what you think .	what am i supposed to think ?
honey , about what ?	you stole from them , you lied to me . how do you think that 's supposed to make me feel ?
you think you know what this money is ?	yes , i ...
no , you do n't know what it is . it 's not for me . this money 's for you , for when you come back from england with honors to set you up , so you do n't have to depend on anybody again . diane , i take better care of these people than their families do . i care for them , i give them flowers , i feed them , i wipe their mouths ...	no , but you stole from them .
i made their lives better .	you let me believe you . you knew you were guilty , and you let me become a part of it . god , how ... how could you ...
alright , alright . go ahead . when i 'm old , give me someone like me , but go ahead .	i trusted you . i stood up in court five years ago and i picked you .
why are you being so hateful to me ? is this because of lloyd ?	no . i told you everything , you lied to me . i would have done anything for you .
that 's right , work it out .	no , i will . i do n't want to leave something out because i know i can say anything to you . you 're a liar , and a thief .
take it easy how mad you make me , i 'm the only dad you 've got .	i 'm so ashamed dad .
do n't say that , it 's not good for you . you 're ...	you 're right .
hello .	hi .
mom , please ?	diane , i do have a history with this man , and it 's not the greatest . i see you so seldom , i 'd really rather know about you .
this is me telling you about me .	you know , i do n't even know if you 've got a young man in your life ?
i just wonder what could be more important than what 's going on with dad .	if we could just talk about boys everything would be so much easier . you know , your room is always ready for you , you can always come home if ... alright , what do you want me to do ?
if they ask you questions , and they probably will ask you questions , would you please say something nice about him mum ? help him ?	alright .
you will ?	okay . oh , here 's ray . just talk to him because when you do n't , your mouth turns down .
thank-you . the real world .	look at those eyes .
no noise , no sound , no movement , nothing ! hello , diane ?	hi . you called me ?
yeah . i read about your fellowship in the paper , and i 'm very glad you called me back .	yeah ?
yeah . i just wanted to congratulate you on your scholarship to england , and i wanted to tell you that i thought your speech was really incredible .	thank you very much .
whoah , what a day , huh ?	yeah . what a day .
yeah .	yeah .
quick question - do you know who i am ?	yes , we sat together at bell 's square .
yeah , yeah , yeah . you remember ?	no , i read it on the message .

whoa .	would you hold this for me ?
what are these ?	they 're bavarian death style pretzels .
oh . um , would it be terrible if i wanted to go home early ?	no .
keymaster ?	yeah , i have to judge who can drive home and who ca n't . i have to keep their keys .
so it 's an honor ?	no .
so we can finally talk ?	yeah .
he does this every year ?	it 's the worst job since keymaster .
thank-you .	i hereby surrender my duties as keymaster , give me a beer .
have a good sleep .	bye .
alright , this is some of the things they wrote me ; `` glad i finally met you '' , `` you always seemed nice '' , `` wish i could have known you more '' ...	mine say stuff like `` lloyd , see you around maybe ''
nobody knew me before tonight .	they knew of you . now they know you .
yeah , but i feel like i fit in for the first time , you know ? like i just held them far away from me , and they did the same to me .	that 's cool then .
it 's just you and your dad , right ?	yeah , but that 's an old story , you do n't want to hear it .
sure i do .	well , my parents split up when i was thirteen , and ... god , i actually had to ... i went into court and i had to choose between the two of them . so i chose my dad . it just felt safer that way , you know ?
thanks . but either way it still feels ...	twisted ?
you know what ?	what ?
you 're a great date . i 've never really gone out with someone as basic as you .	basic . hmmm .
so what 's your job this summer ?	job ? being a great date .
no , i 'm serious .	so am i. i want to see you again . i want to see you as much as i can before you leave . i said it .
i only have something like sixteen weeks .	sixteen weeks is a long time .
then call me tomorrow .	today is tomorrow .
yeah .	or , or i could always wear this one .
boy , this is a mother dictionary .	yeah , i 've had it forever . i used to have this thing with marking the words that i looked up .
nice one .	yeah ?
i think you should wear that .	you think so ?
oh .	i had a checklist in mind . i thought that if babies were on the plane , the plane could n't crash . but all the babies were crying , and i thought they knew something i did n't .
after work ?	i usually have a break after the dinner service , if you want to stop by .
wo n't you see me later ?	i know you think my job is strange . you do n't like old people , do you ?
me ? sure i do .	come on .
i think that 's ageism , and that 's , that 's being prejudiced against people because they 're old . maybe their mouths do n't work as well as yours .	really ? um ... i ... well ... you 're really turning me around here ,
stop by later .	okay , bye , i will .
okay , bye .	i 'll see you there . bye .

yes .	what did you say ?
it 's okay , everybody does that .	i just do n't want it to get too heavy . i feel really overloaded . i have this theory of convergence , that good things always happen with bad things . but i know you have to deal with them at the same time , but i just , i mean i do n't know why they have to happen at the same time , i mean , i do n't know why , i just wish i could work out ... am i just babbling ? do you know what i mean ?

how do you know what i 'm going to say ?	i do n't know what you 're going to say , but i think that ...
i was just going to tell you that i love you . i said it .	i know . lloyd , let 's not start putting things on this level .
what ? this is a good level , is n't it ?	how can i look at you and say this ?
i think that we should spend some time apart .	what 's wrong ?
well , i need to study , and ...	you need to study ?
yeah .	okay , how much time do you need ? i mean , you know , i mean you 'll be leaving in a little while , so that 's answered some questions .
we 'll see .	okay . it 's good knowing this .
okay , what did we just decide ?	we decided ...
'cause i 'm worried , did you just break up with me ?	no , no .
it sounded like you did .	no . we decided that we 're friends . i mean , i know it 's a terrible word ...
well , if we 're friends , why ca n't we see each other ?	i think that we should stop going out on dates .
i feel like a dick . you must think i 'm a dick .	no , i do n't , i do n't .
yeah you do .	lloyd , we shared the most intimate thing two people can share .
you shared it with a dick .	no i did n't .
is this because of your dad ?	no .
did you talk to corey ?	why , did you tell corey what happened ?
she figured it out . i 'm sorry if that upsets you .	no , that 's fine . she 'll tell everybody , but that 's fine .
did you tell anybody ?	just my dad .
you told your dad ?	you have corey and dc . i have my dad .
what , i 'm sorry i said that . forget i said it , it 's what i thought i meant , but forget it .	lloyd , i love you , okay ?
what is that ? what are you doing with your hands ? talk to me , you 're talking like that girl sheila .	do n't be mean , this is hard for me too .
then do n't do it .	oh shit .
what do you want ?	i 'm sorry .
what do you want ?	my father 's guilty . he lied to me , he lied to everybody . i just left home ... i need you .
you do ?	everything else means nothing to me . if i hurt you again , i 'll die .
hurt me again ? not a chance , do n't worry about it .	i love you .
what ?	i love you . how many more times do i have to say it ?
one more time would be nice .	i love you . please , i love you .
i 'm fine .	okay , good , this is all very noble .
okay .	alright , high level air safety tips . if anything happens , it 'll usually be in the first five minutes of the flight , right ?
okay .	so when you hear the smoking sign go 'ding ' , you know everything 's going to be okay .
good to know .	right , i 'm just going to keep talking until that ding happens , which is going to be soon .
okay .	alright , personalised flight care from corey . books , cassettes , magazines , anything ?
how 's it going ?	nobody thought we 'd do this . nobody really thinks it 's going to work , do they ?
no . you just described every great success story . alright , it 's alright .	i know .
man , all you got ta do is find a girl who looks just like her , nail her , and then dump her man , get her off your mind .	your only mistake is that you did n't dump her first . diane court is a showpony . you need a stallion , my friend . walk with us and you walk tall .
it 's your castle , man .	man , you never had a chance with a girl like that .
hey man , i was in love once . i got hurt really bad . i never wan na go through that again .	man , you 're bringing me down !

okay , i 'll give here the message .	okay . she 's really pretty great , is n't she ?
what ?	she 's really pretty great , is n't she ?
yeah , she is . good luck .	okay . good afternoon . goodbye .
hi . lloyd dobler , sir . pleasure to meet you .	hello lloyd .
hello . heard about that graduation present . really quite a car . look , i know you 're busy , you do n't ' have to retain me , but you can trust me . i 'll tell you a couple of things about myself , i 'm nineteen , been overseas for a couple of semesters , but now i 'm back . i 'm an athlete , so i rarely drink . kickboxing . you heard of kickboxing , sport of the future ? don 'the dragon ' wilson , lenny [ ? ] merciless , one of the champions of the sport ? i can see by your face , no . my point is , you can relax because your daughter will be safe with me for the next seven to eight hours .	fine lloyd .
how ya doing ? is she around ?	yeah . honey ?
thanks lloyd .	how do you pay for one of those ?
yeah lloyd . what are your plans for the future ?	spend as much time as possible with diane before she leaves .
seriously , lloyd .	i 'm totally and completely serious .
no , really .	you mean like career ? uh , i do n't know . i 've , i 've thought about this quite a bit sir , and i 'd have to say considering what 's waiting out there for me , i do n't want to sell anything , buy anything or process anything as a career . i do n't want to sell anything bought or processed , or buy anything sold or processed , or ... process anything sold , bought or processed , or repair anything sold , bought or processed , you know , as a career i do n't want to do that . so , uh , my father 's in the army , he wants me to join , but i ca n't work for that corporation , so what i 've been doing lately is kickboxing , which is really a , uh , new sport , but i think it 's got a good future . as far as career longevity goes , i do n't really know , because , you know , you ca n't really tell . your training sticks as a fighter , you know , but it 's no good , you know , you have to be great , but i ca n't really tell if i 'm great until i 've had a couple of pro fights . but i have n't been knocked out yet . i do n't know , i ca n't figure it all out tonight sir , i 'm going to hang with your daughter .
hi , lloyd . this is my eighth and final call ...	go ahead , pick it up if you want .
she would n't get out of the car . i brought her all the way here , she said she was going to come here , and she would n't get out of the car . but i thought that is was important , that she come to see you , because i know that if you go somewhere and you do n't deal with your family stuff , then you 're just gon na , she 's gon na , um ...	are you going to england with her lloyd ?
that 's one of the things i wanted to talk to you about sir .	are you ?
am i going ? am i going to england ? i 've thought about this quite a bit , and i 've realised what i probably should do is just carve out a goal for my future and find out what i wan na do with my life , do all the stuff that i 've been avoiding in a big way . i mean , diane and i can wait for each other , right ? what 's she gon na ... she 's gon na run off with some english guy ? there 's no way .	well lloyd , i admire you for not hitching a ride . you know , my daughter 's a lot different to you .
i know .	she 's very successful .
i know	very talented .
i know . but then i reconsidered . 'cause i figured out what i really wan na do with my life , what i want to do for a living is i wan na be with your daughter . i 'm good at it .	you 're not a permanent part of her life . you 're a distraction .
i 'm the distraction that 's going to england with her sir . are you alright sir ? are you okay ?	i 'm incarcerated , lloyd ! i do n't deserve to lose my daughter over this . i do n't deserve to have you as my go-between . and i ca n't for the life of me figure out how she could choose to champion in mediocrity the way she flirts around you .
`` you ca n't know the horrible disappointment i feel ... ''	i know this part , keep reading .
she ca n't still be angry at this , it 's got ta get better .	it does , it does if it 's the version signed 'i still ca n't help loving you ' . read that .
just her name .	just knowing a person like that exists , knowing that for a minute that she felt that and wrote 'i still ca n't help loving you ' . that 's got ta be a good thing , right ? that 's got ta be a good thing .
joe . joe . she 's written sixty-five songs . they 're all about you . they 're all about pain .	so what 's up ?
stop freaking with her head man . just stop playing with her mind , you know ? she 's a human being . she 's a person . she 's very talented , you know .	dude , why do you think i keep her tapes ? they 're going to be valuable some day .
my car .	your car ?
diane court .	dude , i ca n't do it !
lloyd . lloyd dobler , i 've got you .	how ya doin ' miss evans ?
you missed every one of your career counselling sessions . call me obsessive , compulsive , but let 's do this right now .	no way .
lloyd .	what ?
do n't make this like a counsel , lloyd . i got statistics i can show you , i got graphs i can show you . that 's all the stuff i can show you , it all says the same thing . you have to decide on a career .	my dad 's a lieutenant colonel in the army , he wants me to join , he wants to pull some strings . i mean , there 's no possible way .
lloyd , everybody in that party put something down on their record except you .	how many people really know what they want though ? i mean , a lot of them think that they have to know , right ? but inside , they do n't really know , so , i do n't know . but i know that i do n't know .
oh boy .	hey .
mike cameron , how you doing ?	what ?
mike cameron . this is one fresh jam , huh ?	yeah .
yeah , hey , oh god . listen , i wanted to ... i do n't know you very well , you know , but i wanted to ask you , how did you get diane court to go out with you ?	i called her up .
yeah , but how come it worked ? i mean like , what are you ?	i 'm lloyd dobler .

oskar - my friend lena .	how do you do ? what can i get you , what 're you drinking ?
nothing 's changed . then again , something has changed , has n't it ?	things worked out . i made some money over there , had some laughs , you know . it was good .
now you 're back .	now i 'm back , and you know what i 'm going to do now ? i 'm going to have a good time . so are you .
he 's essential . without him , everything comes to a grinding halt . if that happens -	itzhak stern ? he 's on the list .
well , let 's find him .	he 's on the list . if he were an essential worker , he would not be on the list . he 's on the list . you ca n't have him .
what 's your name ?	sir , the list is correct .
i did n't ask you about the list , i asked you your name .	klaus tauber .
the gentleman thinks a mistake 's been made .	my plant manager is somewhere on this train . if it leaves with him on it , it 'll disrupt production and the armaments board will want to know why .
you know what , you 'd like her .	oskar , please -
what -	i do n't have to like her just because you do . it does n't work that way .
it 's not a charade , all this ?	a charade ? how could it be a charade ?
luck .	war .
what ?	i feel like an old-fashioned couple . it feels good .
should i stay ?	it 's a beautiful city .
should i stay ?	it 's up to you .
your friend amon goeth has been arrested .	i 'm sorry to hear that .
there are some things that are unclear . we need to talk .	i 'd love to , it 'll have to wait until i get back . i have to leave .
all right , okay , let 's talk .	in breslau .
we started without you .	good .
you know , they told me you were going to be trouble - czurda and scherner .	you 're kidding .
he looks great , though , does n't he ? i have to know - where do you get a suit like that ? what is that , silk ? it 's great .	i 'd say i 'd get you one but the guy who made it , he 's probably dead , i do n't know .
i go to work the other day , there 's nobody there . nobody tells me about this , i have to find out , i have to go in , everybody 's gone -	they 're not gone , they 're here .
every day that goes by , i 'm losing money . every worker that is shot , costs me money - i have to get somebody else , i have to train them -	we 're going to be making so much money , none of this is going to matter -
it 's bad business .	some of the boys went crazy , what 're you going to do ? you 're right , it 's bad business , but it 's over with , it 's done . occasionally , sure , okay , you got to make an example . but that 's good business .
scherner told me something else about you .	yeah , what 's that ?
that you know the meaning of the word gratitude . that it 's not some vague thing with you like with some guys .	true .
do you have any idea what 's involved ? the paperwork alone ? forget you got to build it all , getting the fucking permits , that 's enough to drive you crazy . then the engineers show up . they stand around and they argue about drainage - i 'm telling you , you 'll want to shoot somebody , i 've been through it , i know .	well , you 've been through it . you know . you could make things easier for me .
it 's true . never happen in cracow , though , we all love you too much .	i pay you too much .
you held back stern . you held back the one man most important to my business .	he 's important to my business .
what do you want for him , i 'll give it to you .	i want him . come on , let 's go inside , let 's have a good time .
i tried to call you , i 'm running a little late , this is taking longer than i thought . have a drink .	what 's going on ?
you took my workers .	they 're taking mine . when i said they did n't have a future i did n't mean tomorrow . auschwitz .
when ?	i do n't know . soon .
you want these people .	these people , my people , i want my people .
what are you , moses ? what is this ? where 's the money in this ? what 's the scam ?	it 's good business .
oh , this is `` good business '' in your opinion . you 've got to move them , the equipment , everything to czechoslovakia - it does n't make any sense .	look -
you 're not telling me something .	it 's good for me - i know them , i 'm familiar with them . it 's good for you - you 'll be compensated . it 's good for the army . you know what i 'm going to make ? artillery shells . tank shells . they need that . everybody 's happy .
if you admit to making three , then it 's four , actually . but how ?	i just told you .
yeah , all right , do n't tell me , i 'll go along with it , it 's just irritating to me i ca n't figure it out .	all you have to do is tell me what it 's worth to you . what 's a person worth to you .
where are the guards ?	the guards are n't allowed on the factory floor . they make my workers nervous .
what 's that ?	you do n't recognize it ? maybe that 's because it 's not what i asked for .
you asked for shoe polish .	my buyers sold it to a guy who sold it to the army . but by the time it got there - because of the cold - it broke , the whole truckload .
so i 'm responsible for the weather ?	i asked for metal , you gave me glass .
this is not my problem .	look it up .
ghetto police . i 'm a policeman now , can you believe it ?	yeah , i can .
hey , poldek , how 's it going ? you know about the list ? you 're on it .	of course i 'm on it .
what do i got for you ?	takes diamonds to stay on this list .
i want to thank you , sir , for giving me the opportunity to work .	you 're welcome , i 'm sure you 're doing a great job .
the ss beat me up . they would have killed me , but i 'm essential to the war effort , thanks to you .	that 's great .
i work hard for you . i 'll continue to work hard for you .	that 's great , thanks .
god bless you , sir .	yeah , okay .
like this ?	there 's nothing in the stores .
you have any idea what a shirt like this costs ?	nice things cost money .
how many ?	i do n't know , ten or twelve . that 's a good color . dark blues , grays .
how you feeling , all right ?	yeah .
what 's the matter , everything all right at home ? mila 's okay ?	she 's good .
what 's wrong with it ?	how should i know ? it 's broken . see what you can do .
good . how 's it going ?	things are great , things are great .
what are you doing ?	i 'm having a drink , come on in , we 'll have a drink .
i mean where have you been ? nobody 's seen you around for a while .	i 've been here . i guess i have n't been out .
i thought maybe you 'd like to come over , have some dinner , some of the people are coming over .	yeah ? yeah , that 'd be nice , let me get my coat .
oskar , good of you to come .	are you kidding , i never miss a party . police chief rasch , my wife emilie .
thank you .	i need a drink .
oh , god , you do n't have a drink ?	wine ?
one of these days the russians are going to show up unannounced at my gate . i 'd like the chance to defend myself . i 'd like my wife to have that chance . my civilian engineers . my secretary .	we 're losing the war , are n't we .
it kind of looks that way .	pistols ?
i 'd never ask you for money , you know that . i do n't even like talking about it - money , favors - i find it very awkward , it makes me very uncomfortable -	no , look . it 's the others . they 're the ones causing these delays .
what others ?	whoever . they 're the ones . they 'd appreciate some kind of gesture from me .
that 'd be fine .	done . lets not talk about it anymore , let 's have a good time .
the place produces nothing . i should n't say that - nothing it produces reaches the army . that 's not all right .	so i 'll talk to him about it .
he 's a friend of yours , you want to help him out . tell me this , though - has he ever once shown you his appreciation ? i 've yet to see it . never a courtesy . never a thank you note . he forgets my wife at christmas time -	he 's got no style , we all know that . so , we should hang him for it ?
he does n't deserve your loyalty . more important , he 's not worth you making threats against us .	did i threaten anybody here ? i stated a simple fact .
i was just the accountant .	simple engineering , though , would n't you think ? change the machines around , whatever you do , you could make other things , could n't you ?
once the war ends , forget it , but for now it 's great , you could make a fortune . do n't you think ?	i think most people right now have other priorities .
get the contracts and i 'm sure you 'll do very well . in fact the worse things get the better you 'll do . it was a `` pleasure . ''	the contracts ? that 's the easy part . finding the money to buy the company , that 's hard .
jews , yeah . investors .	jews can no longer own businesses , sir , that 's why this one 's for sale .
pots and pans .	something they can hold in their hands .
i do n't know anybody who 'd be interested in that .	they should be .
what was that about the ss , the rate , the ... ?	the jewish worker 's salary , you pay it directly to the ss , not to the worker . he gets nothing .
i could try to read this or i could eat my lunch while it 's till hot . we 're doing well ?	yes .
better this month than last ?	yes .
any reason to think next month will be worse ?	the war could end .
what ?	there 's a machinist outside who 'd like to thank you personally for giving him a job .
do n't ever do that to me again .	do what ?
you try to be fair to people , they walk out the door ; i 've never understood that . what 's next ?	christmas presents .
this , i do n't know , maybe you can trade it for something .	thank you .
i got to go , i 'll see you .	oskar -
you think i do n't know what you 're doing ? you 're so quiet all the time ? i know .	are you losing money ?
no , i 'm not losing money , that 's not the point .	what other point is -
you have to understand , goeth 's under enormous pressure . you have to think of it in his situation . he 's got this whole place to run , he 's responsible for everything that goes on here , all these people - he 's got a lot of things to worry about . and he 's got the war . which brings out the worst in people . never the good , always the bad . always the bad . but in normal circumstances , he would n't be like this . he 'd be all right . there 'd be just the good aspects of him . which is a wonderful crook . a guy who loves good food , good wine , the ladies , making money ...	and killing .
i 'll admit it 's a weakness . i do n't think he enjoys it . all right , he does enjoy it , so what ? what do you expect me to do about it ?	there 's nothing you can do . i 'm not asking you to do anything . you came into my office .
i 'll talk to him .	i think it 's too late .
four hundred , four fifty -	more .
eight hundred , give or take .	give or take what , stern - how many - count them .
that 's very generous of you .	yes .
we need to talk .	stern .
they arrived .	they arrived , can you believe it ?
well , that 's to be expected . they have to understand . these are start-up problems . this is n't pots and pans , this is a precise business . i 'll write them a letter .	they 're withholding payment .
there 's a rumor you 've been going around miscalibrating the machines . i do n't think that 's a good idea .	no ?
i know what you 're saying , but i do n't see the difference .	you do n't ? i do . i see a difference .
i 'll talk to you later .	no , no , what , what is it ?
i could 've got more ... if i 'd just ... i do n't know , if i 'd just ... i could 've got more ...	oskar , there are twelve hundred people who are alive because of you . look at them .
if i 'd made more money ... i threw away so much money , you have no idea . if i 'd just ...	there will be generations because of what you did .
i did n't do enough .	you did so much .
it 's got nothing to do with reality , oskar , i know it and you know it , it 's a matter of national priority to these guys . it 's got a ritual significance to them , jews shoveling snow .	i lost a day of production . i lost a worker . i expect to be compensated .
file a grievance with the economic office , it 's your right .	would it do any good ?
a one-armed machinist , oskar ?	he was a metal press operator , quite skilled .
what 's he done that 's so bad - take money ? that 's a crime ? come on , what are we here for , to fight a war ? we 're here to make money , all of us .	there 's taking money and there 's taking money , you know that . he 's taking money .
he 's stealing from you , oskar .	of course he 's stealing from me , we 're in business together . what is this ? i 'm sitting here , suddenly everybody 's talking like this is something bad . we take from each other , we take from the army , everybody uses everybody , it works out , everybody 's happy .
we know that , son .	the killer was trying to get to her . that sorority girl was a distraction .
i can do it , captain .	thanks , dewey , but i was thinking i 'd pull jesse off ...
how 's the name search going ?	37 usages of himbry located in the registar 's office . 9 tatum 's , 47 riley 's . and that 's just on campus . it 's hopeless .
ca n't we hold him ?	no , we got pressure from california state . the man practically has clemency . we ca n't run the risk of falsely accusing him . he has to be standing over the victim with knife in hand before we make a move .
we 're going to bring her in . hide her out for a coupla days . and we 're issuing a campus lock-in this evening . no one is allowed out after dark .	that does n't work , sir .
have you checked the ...	attic , garage , basement , nothing .
we do n't know if it 's random . we have n't been able to connect the victims .	the first two were stabbed without thought . the sorority girl was gutted with autopsy precision .
jesus christ . captain tyler flies out of his seat and into action .	find me every variation of himbry and what was the other name ...
he 's broken his pattern .	they 've broken their pattern .
you 're sure about this two person thing ?	broad daylight , a crowded movie theatre . this is too much fun for one person .
i would say we are now officially baffled .	on national television .
no , they broke up again . bailey wo n't stop drinking and sarah ca n't take it anymore .	thought he was doing aa .
that shit . he only calls you when he 's drunk . do n't go over there .	i wo n't .
do n't . think bailey .	alright , alright ... i 'll call you back .
no , some creep asshole trying to scare me .	it 's hell week . chill . the movie murders have brought out the crazies . it 's nothing .
shit .	what is it ?
i heard a noise .	where ?
kill , kill , kill , kill , hah , hah , hah , hah ...	stop it ...
outside .	that 's smart .
do n't do that . hang up ... call ...	what ? i ca n't hear you ...
hang up ... call ...	i 'm losing you .
... campus security ... send someone ... check out ... place ...	okay , okay . i 'll call now . i 'll call you back .
yes .	who is this ?
cici . who 's this ?	someone who wants to talk to you .
oh , i 'm sorry . my bad . i thought you were someone else .	that 's okay .
who do you want to speak with ? nobody 's here .	where is everybody ?
we 're co-sponsoring the acid rain mixer at the sig ep . house tonight .	why are n't you there ?
i 'm designated driver . i have to be here in case a sister calls and needs a ride .	that 's too bad .
`` drink with your brain . '' that 's our motto . who are you calling for ?	what if i said you ?
what if i said goodbye ?	why would you wan na do that ?
why do you always answer a question with a question ?	i 'm inquisitive .
hello ? ted ?	no , it 's me .
whaaaatt ?	do n't forget to set the alarm .
jesus , you scared me . what are you doing here ?	i live here .
i thought you were going to the mixer ?	i had to change . did anyone call ?
tina , it 's dawnie . i 'm on my way . cici follows her back into the living room .	i 'll go . i do n't mind . really .
cotton .	can we talk ?
i do n't think that 's a good idea .	look , yesterday was n't my idea . that was all gale and dollar signs and ratings .
what do you want from me , cotton ?	you could start with an apology .
i did that .	you wrote me a letter . very cordial . very appropriate .
how ? what could i say that would make a difference ? i took away a year of your life -- how do i apologize for that ?	i wish it was just a year . i lost everything because of you . i have nothing now . look at me , this is what i 've become . a long silence . sidney is hanging on by threads .
i just thought if i saw you face to face , maybe it would help .	did it ?
it helped me realize one thing .	what ?
its perfect , sidney . no one will ever suspect me . i have proof . im the victim .	please , cotton , dont do this .
i get my revenge and make some fast cash .	its over , cotton .
you know the story , gale . man falsely accused , sent to prison , proved innocent , released back into the real world and never trusted again . want the exclusive ?	did you do it ?
now , gale , you were so instrumental in my freedom . you 're not having character doubts now , are you ?	you have a right to be angry .
no , gale , i do n't have any rights . you made sure of that .	cotton , i 've done nothing but help you .
do n't do anything stupid , cotton . you 've come to far .	gale , i do n't know what i 'm doing from one moment to the next . i 'm just taking it as it comes .
look , i 'm sorry about the face .	job hazard . debbie salt , stringer -- newsweek . answer a few questions ?
fair enough .	what are you doing here ? i thought you had retired from field reporting ?
well , you know i 'm dear to the subject matter .	and much richer as a result .
do i know you ? you look familiar .	i took your vulture seminar seminar at berkeley last year .
hi , gale , any leads ?	tons and tons .
where is sidney 's father ?	home -- where he lives .
and are the police sure about that ?	why do n't you ask them ?
already did . he 's the perfect suspect , do n't you think ?	no , i do n't .
parents are always responsible . it all starts in the home .	look , i know you kinda hold me up as your career template and it gives you some anal charge to challenge me but you win . okay ? i 'm not interested in the scoop anymore . excuse me .
i couldnt believe you didnt recognize me . you even interviewed me for your book .	youre all in this together ?
jesus , youre just as whacked as your son .	where do you think he got it ? mental illness is heriditary . who do you think incouraged him to kill your mother ? he was a smart kid but children need parental guidance .
what are you going to do ?	finish what my son started .
but youll never get away with it .	enter cotton weary .
how do you put up with this greek shit ?	hey , it 's cool . hallie 's into it , i 'm into hallie ...
my documentary is due on tuesday .	what 's your subject ?
i could use some therapy .	should we be worried about this guy ? is n't it kinda weird he just showed up and now people are dying ?
i think he 's doing dolly .	`` and i hope life treats you kind and i hope you have all you dreamed of offffff . i wish you joyyy . ''
are they aware of your not so positive portrayal of greek life ?	not one bit .
where 's sid ?	she dumped me .
no way .	yeah .
how are you ? you were n't in class . i called as soon as i heard ...	i skipped . too many `` that 's her '' looks .
i 'm sorry , baby . what can i do ' ?	do n't ask what you can do . no coddling . life rolls on status quo .
it 's okay . i can peddle toilet paper .	sid , you do n't have to .
where have you been ' ? you missed my shining moment . i won the macaroni sundae binge .	i 'm sorry honey . i got behind .
about what ?	the forbidden subject .
lem me take you home .	i 'll get my jacket .
this is exactly what i do n't want .	i think it 's out of your control .
my screwed up life should n't have to bleed onto my friends .	let us decide that .
what about your film ? is n't it due next week ? have you even started it ?	it 's under control .
i had the four o'clock shift . you were n't there . you had us worried . is everything okay ?	no , it 's not .
i do n't really know what happened in woodsboro , sid . but i know you do n't trust me .	it 's not you , derek . i do n't trust myself . i tend to make big selection errors when it comes to men .
go on , untie him .	no . this is a set up .
why ?	good question . you took the bait .
poor cotton , could life be a little more cruel ?	youre not going to get away with this .
yeah , were trying to send a message to hollywood . im really getting tired of all the happy endings . its just not reality . in the real world the good guys die , the innocent are punished , and the murderers inherit the earth .	but nobody wants to see that . itll never go . theyll rewrite you . you dont want that .
two .	so you 'll relieve me at 2:30 ...
where 's sid ?	damned if i know . she ditched me .
you were n't supposed to leave her alone .	i did n't say she was alone . that guy -- from her home town showed up . they went off together .
she 's got guards with her .	what guy ?
he seemed harmless .	are n't most serial killers seemingly harmless ?
need some help , honey .	i got it..
yeah , you look quizzical yet pensive .	yeah , how can we help ? do you have any questions regarding the sequel of your life ?
ever see natural born killers ? well , derek and i have this whole mickey/mallory-woody harrelson/juliette lewis thing going on .	i really dont like that comparison , honey .
he hates oliver stone .	i find his work overwrought .
he sent me the cutest e-mail .	i read her postings on the horror movie chat boards and fell hopelessly . hook , line ...
we have our own website now . we dedicated a whole page to you .	youd me amazed at how many of us there are out there . its a whole world , sid . youre really popular amongst the demented .
youre the one who got away .	until now .
of course not . who wants to ? whats the point if we dont get caught ? wheres the glamour in that ?	the way i see it . well be arrested . go to prison . cash in on the home footage . secure a book deal . if all goes as planned , our trial should coincide with the release of stab ii .
a verdict and premiere all on the same day . i love it .	were hoping for the death penalty . i have this whole dead man walking swan song exit planned .
and now , drum roll please ...	hope youre ready , sid . we got one last surprise for you .
a twist ending if you will .	yeah , we really had our work cut out for us . it really is the curse of the sequel . the billy/stu things been done .
..so we had to be different but yet the same because if you venture to far away from your orginal story you completely alienate the audience ...	and we didnt want to do that , sid . we wanted to give you your moneys worth .
so we found a compromise .	or it found us .
we have a surprise guest star waiting in the wings .	just for you , sid .
oh yeah . we figure the one of us that actually kills you will get a little more press . its been an ongoing discussion . heads or tails ?	tails .
we had to have financing .	tuitions expensive .
hello , dwight .	miss weathers .
i 've been trying to reach you but you have n't returned ...	i 'm on crowd patrol , miss weathers , excuse me .
yes , miss weathers , your name is embedded clearly between my ears .	i see you read the book .
yes , i do retain reading skills . shock .	and an explanation is , of course , out of the question .
page 32 . `` deputy dewey filled the room with his dim-witted barney fifish presence . '' i think you 've explained yourself .	oh dewey , i 'm sorry .
you have every right to be upset .	page 41 . `` deputy dewey oozed with inexperience . ''
i never meant to imply ...	how do you know my dim-witted inexperience is n't merely a subtle form of manipulation used to lower people 's expectations thereby enhancing my ability to effectively maneuver within any given situation ?
i 'm sorry . i do n't know what else to say except i 'm sorry .	no , i 'm the one who 's sorry . i misjudged you . now if you 'll excuse me , i have some oozing to do .
so what made you change your mind about sidney ?	mood swing . i 'm manic depressive .
you 're a hard one to figure out . gale it 's that complex yet shallow quality . it 's deliberate .	i think you 're all an act .
and deep down i 'm a good person ? make no mistake , dewey , i 'm a shit .	i know that .
yeah ?	i also know that you 're an aging tv reporter slash writer who , despite huge tabloid success , has some self worth issues regarding your personal life which directly effects your professional life in a non-positive manner . a coupla failed relationships with -- i 'm guessing balding , older men -- have turned you into this bitch with a cell phone . but i bet sometimes , late at night , when you 're all alone a sadness seeps to the surface and in a moment of clarity you know that all you really want is to be touched and held and fondled .
not good . how you doin ?	not good .
if you were truly a copycat , would n't you want to emulate everything about the killer that you could ?	meaning ?
he 's already got ta be a part of sid 's life . what do you know about this derek ?	solid alibis . he was with sidney when she was attacked .
you broke my heart .	what are we looking for ?
a bloody knife . a ghost mask . something like that ?	can we turn the light on ?
and it 's sexier in the dark .	dewey , you and i would never make it .
maybe not . but think about the sex . as frustrated as i am ...	..and as lonely as i am ...
they 're roomates .	and joel 's pre-med .
the sorority girl was gutted with autopsy precision .	shit ! it 's both of them . the first murders were to throw us - using the same names as woodsboro . but they 've moved on- -they 're getting closer to sidney . they 're not looking for a himbry or a tatum to kill . they 're looking for the new tatum .
ssshh ! what was that ?	let 's find out .
this is all too familiar .	over here .
maybe they never got here . he could have taken her anywhere .	c'mon . let 's go .
jesus christ !	he filmed his victims .
let 's go .	no , wait here .
dewey ?	there 's nothing . i 'm coming down .
three hundred people watched ? nobody did anything ?	they thought it was a publicity stunt .
oh my god . how could it happen ?	they do n't know . it was carefully planned . earlier in the day the victims received anonymous passes to the movie .
as of now , they do n't see any relation . but they 're checking it out . the state , special task force , fbi -- they 're all here . they 'll find the guy .	yeah , right .
look , sid , why do n't you take off ? disappear for a few days . i 'll come with you .	no . i will not crawl under a rock . this is a fucked-up world and people kill people all the time . i 'll just get used to it .
you go , it 's all stairs , i can take it from here .	do n't worry ...
dewey , i 'm completely equipped with mace , alarm whistle , keyring , knife , a degree in defensive combat ...	just in case ...
the police are waiting outside . they 're going to take you somewhere safe .	dewey , there 's no such place .
hey , i got stuff to do . but i 'll find you later , okay .	whatever .
who is this ?	i 'll give you one guess .
who are you ?	that 's not the way we play the game .
i do n't play games .	what if your life depended on it ?
what do you want ?	you 're pretty when you 're angry .
where are you ?	i 'm everywhere .
oh -- a god complex	stay away from the cop .
what do you want from me ?	it 's what you want from me .
what do you mean ?	you are writing another book , are n't you ? that 's why you 're here . the story 's not over .
you 're getting obvious .	no , gale , i 'm just getting started . seeya soon .
no , wait ...	watch your back .
sidney . hello . how are you ?	i 'm okay . people magazine wo n't stop calling but other than that ...
i 'm sorry .	yeah , well ... you are the definition of mixed emotions . i really should hate you ... i see your movie 's getting good reviews .
it seems to be causing a stir . what 's with the toilet paper ?	it 's hell week . i 'm pledging the deltas .
it 's good to see you involved .	my morn was a delta .
sid , i 'll come with you .	but who would operate your camera ?
what ?	oh my god .
someones trying to kill me . i need the police .	are you in danger now ?
yes , goddammit !	where is your attacker ?
i dont know .	stay under the safety light . help is on its way .
lucas and his romper room stage .	i got . i got it . friday the 13th , part 20 .
i have rehearsal .	i have to watch rehearsal .
shut up . mickey , you and i can take her late evening .	sig ep 's got ta band , tonight .
he tried to kill her first .	is sid in therapy ?
i got a surprise for you .	what ?
`` if i should stay . i would only be in your way . so i 'll go . and yet , i know , i 'll think of you each step of the way ...	do n't do this .
you 're going to get it . you know what happens .	but i love you . and i want the whole world to know it .
knock yourself out .	hello ? hello ?
time to change numbers again ?	nah ... i think it 'll die off . it 's opening weekend . let 's see how it goes .
okay , you 're sure about skipping calculas ?	please , i have the perfect excuse .
what about rehearsal ?	got ta .
that was good .	yeah , right .
who is that guy ?	it 's okay . look , hallie , i 'll meet you outside .
no , girletta , i do n't leave your side .	i 've got my entourage . take a break . please .
we 're missing the sig ep party .	no , hallie , not tonight . parties and mass murderers do n't go together . trust me .
it 's okay to break , girl . you shatter if you have to .	i 'd really just like to be alone .
can i come with her ?	no , hallie , i 'm not gon na take you down too . i 'll be alright .
i 'm the only one who can cut him down .	it 's not a good idea , hallie .
oh , sid , youre sounding desparate . i guess fearing death makes one anxious .	you fucking freaked out movie nut psychos..
a patio chair comes flying through a glass door . the young girl in the movie tears off running , screaming , flying through the room .	the crowd is really with the movie . some even talk to the screen . `` you dumb bitch . get out of the house . '' etc .
the young girl runs by a window . she looks in . a ghost masked killer stares back . the figure crashes through the window attacking her . she fights him off , getting away , running ...	everyone in the theater is screaming . maureen tries her best to detach herself from the movie . she eats her popcorn .
the ghost advances on the young girl , grabbing her , pulling her to him , raising high a long , hunting knife . the young girl is helpless ...	maureen looks at phil , confused ... as if seeing for the first time ... it 's not phil . she pulls away when , the ghost-masked figure grabs her with one hand , the other one clutching the hunting knife . maureen sees it , her mouth billowing forth a loud scream that is matched by the entire audience as they scream at the screen .
the young girl , clutching her bloody chest ... drags herself , crawling across wet grass ... the killer behind her ... raising his knife again .	popcorn flies as maureen falls forward , into the aisle , clutching her bloody stomach . she 's speechless , unable to scream . she holds her bloody hand out for all to see , begging for help . she stumbles down the aisle . someone yells `` sit down . '' maureen turns to several people who begin to react . she turns behind her to see the ghost face coming at her again ... knife raised .
the young girl is slashed again .	the knife slices into maureen again ... then again . the theatre audience is starting to take note as the ghost keeps slashing at her repeatedly with the knife . a horrifying , sickening sight .
how many guys they have on you ?	i counted four .
i 've been waiting for you , baby .	is that cool ? just to leave her like that ?
randy meeks . he was with sid that night in woodsboro .	her old boyfriend ?
and white .	easy black boy .
have they questioned you yet , sid ?	this has nothing to do with me , joel . there 's an estimated 270 serial killers currently active in the us at any given time . i ca n't control that . who 's hungry ?
i got ta hit the library . anatomy . some of us have real majors . you gon na be okay , sid ?	you 're not allowed to ask that .
i 'll stop by the deltas tonight .	thanks , joel .
perfect . i 'll be outta micro-bio and we can grab a bite .	guys , guys , i 'm sorry but , no way .
sid , i 'll seeya tonight .	but ...
..this week 's tke kegger ...	ne ask that you sell individual squares of toilet paper for a mere nickel a piece .
it 's all about sisterhood . everybody thinks its about partying and blowjobs but ...	..we only promote safe rubbered sex .
..it 's really about family and tradition ...	..harmonica style is okay .
hello ?	gale ?
she 's not here right now .	but she 's standing right next to you .
what do you care ? let 'em have their fun . so , what 's up ?	what 's your favorite scary movie ?
showgirls . absolutely frightening . what 's yours ? wait , let me guess . the house on sorority row ? final exam . graduation day ? the dorm that dripped blood ? splatter university ? am i close ?	closer than you think .
do you want to die ?	gee , let me think . `` do you want to ... '' is that the best you can do ? some tired hand me down rehash ? hey , pal , no one 's gon na write a book about you . no movie rights . nothing . i 've been through this before and much better i might add .
i hate scary movies .	it 'll be okay , baby , i 'll hold your hand .
if we hurry , we can still catch the sandra bullock movie .	we got free tickets .
take it off .	but ...
now why does she have to be naked ? how does that serve the plot ?	sssshhh . on screen the phone rings . the young girl pulls the shower curtain aside to reveal a robe hung on a hook . she grabs it , running from the bathroom , into the living room , grabbing the phone .
why does n't she just hang up and call the police ? stupid..	shush .
you ass .	i 'm sorry , i 'm sorry but i had to . it was too easy .
come on , baby . lighten up a little , will ya ?	i get scared really easy , okay .
i just have a hard time with insipid , sexist violence .	we can still sandra bullock it .
sid ? jesus , where 's hallie ? i 've been here all night .	listen to me . we 've got to get help . the killer 's here .
what are you talking about ?	he 's after me .
i 'll be right back .	where you going ?
what was that ?	do n't panic .
what do you want ?	i 'm sorry , sid , please . i never should have gone along with gale . i know i 'm stupid . i wish i had some good reason to give you but i 'm just stupid . please , sid , do n't be mad at me .
do you work for her now ?	well , yeah ... she gave me a job . freelance . it got me outta woodsboro . i 'm sorry about cotton and yesterday . it was a bad idea . i knew it was a bad idea but it seemed like a quasi harmless bad idea . ah , shit , sid , i 'm fucked up . sidney looks at him long and hard , a smile slowly appearing .
if he 's innocent he 'll have an alibi .	i guess gale 's going to be pissed she missed her exclusive .
i 'll relay it . you sure you do n't wan na go home ?	i have this button i press . see ? it insulates me . she mimes an air lock valve .
thanks for the movie , randy .	anytime . sorry it sucked . it just had that been there done that feeling .
i think jeff bridges is getting tired .	nah i think it 's doing so damn well because one of it 's players got iced . i just hope none of us end up dead .
oh that 's right . those poor poor people . god ben damon was such a hottie .	and that cici chick was n't that bad either but i 'm really concerned about my safety now .
there 's always someone out there stalking actors . look at that woman from the commish .	melinda mcgraw ?
no , jennifer love hewitt . of course it 's me , silly . and i feel like an ass standing in this theater lobby all by myself . where are you babe , the movie starts in twenty minutes .	look , i 'm stuck on the freeway . i think there was some big accident . it could be a little while so i do n't want you to start freaking if i do n't get there at exactly , eight thirty .
all i 'm saying is i 'm gon na be royally p.o . 'd if you do n't catch my acting debut .	oh i would n't miss it for the world . i bet you did such a great job .
i did . hon , although i got a total of six minutes screen time , they 're the best six minutes of the movie .	heh heh i bet they are babe . i bet they are . look , my battery 's dying . . .
jesus . hello ?	hello .
who is this ?	who is this ?
well what number are you trying to reach ?	i do n't know .
i think you got the wrong number , buddy .	do i ?
uh-huh . look bro , my battery is running out . really wish i could chat , but i ca n't so , later .	wait , wait . do n't hang up .
asshole , ca n't talk .	but your voice sounds so familiar .
you almost sound like that guy from there 's something about carrie . ben . ben damon .	well ya got me . that 's me . i 'm ben damon .
really ? you 're such a talented actor .	thanks .
what do you mean ?	i mean , i 'm standing right outside the ladies room door at the plaza theater . your girlfriend christine is in there . she 's all alone . everyone 's in the auditorium waiting for the film to start . i 've got my knife .
listen you sick fuck , is this your idea of a joke ?	more of a game really .
what kind of a game ?	you seem to be familiar with the stab movies . here 's how we play . i ask you a question . you get it right , your girlfriend lives . you answer wrong , she dies .
i swear to god if you lay a finger on her i 'll fucking kill you !	maybe so , but right now , we play the game . first question , your girlfriend 's counting on you , name your girlfriend 's character in stab 2 ?
it 's cici ! cici 's the name of the character she plays in the movie !	very good . now we play round 2 .
what ? ! but i did everything you said to do !	that 's right . and you beat round 1. now we 're taking the game to a whole new level . meet me beneath the hollywood sign in ten minutes . i 'll have your girlfriend . we 'll be waiting .
what ? !	good bye ben .
you 're not playing by the rules ben . do n't you want her to live ?	i swear to god if you lay one hand on her !
yeah .	very good . you follow directions well . now for the final part of the game . put down the bat and approach the sign , slowly .
where are you ?	closer than you think .
alright i 'm here . what the fuck do you want from me ?	to see your reaction .
can i help you ?	i 'm gale weathers , author of the woodsboro and windsor college murders , and anchorwoman for total entertainment . maybe you 've heard of me ?
i do n't watch tv and i hate books . whatta you need ?	does the name maureen prescott sound familiar to you ?
nope .	well can you tell me if the woman in this picture looks familiar to you .
listen , i 'm busy . nobody has access to those files except studio execs . can you please go away now ?	well if you wo n't work for me , will you work for the president ?
i know every face in here , respect for the unknown actor i suppose , myself included . if you 're looking for maureen prescott --	it may be maureen reynolds --
what are these movies ? 'amazombies ' , 'space psychos ' 'creatures from thesan andreas fault ' ?	horror flicks . b-movies from milton 's heyday .
jesus christ you scared the shit out of me .	i 'm sorry miss weathers . allow me to introduce myself , mark kincaid , l.a.p.d . are you familiar with the actor ben damon , or the actress christine perkins ?
well i interviewed damon once for the show . he was a real obnoxious fuck . any way , the second one , christine perkins , she had a part in stab 2 , did n't she ? she was playing cici .	both of them were found brutally murdered this morning under the hollywood sign . autopsy reports having come back to me yet but the bodies looked like something out one of the stab films .
so is that why you 're here ? is that why you 're holding me from my show , to tell me about some brutal homicide i 'm not even involved in ?	i wish that was all miss weathers , but there 's more . the killer left a note .
that 's sidney prescott 's mother .	there 's more .
i 've tried to get in touch with sidney prescott , but she 's keeping herself very well hidden . you 're my one and only hope in finding her . her life may be in grave danger .	i 'd love to help , really i would n't mind being sliced at again by a maniacal psychopath , but i honestly do n't know where sidney is . after windsor she dropped off the face of the earth . the only other person that might know is , , not going to talk .
alright kincaid , no where to ?	i go to the police station and do my job , and you go back to being gale weathers .
oh . i thought you wanted me to stick around .	look , miss weathers , if there 's a problem , give me a call . here 's my card . i 'm always there .
that 's stab 3 , miss weathers . it looks like we 're going to be getting a warrant to speak with miss prescott anyway .	shit . sarah darling . i interviewed her too . god , it 's happening again is n't it detective ?
who ?	i 'm not at liberty to tell you that miss weathers . you 're no longer working with the l.a.p.d . i do n't even know why you 're standing in here right now . by all means i should have you thrown out .
but you wo n't . you 're a good man detective . we think alike . i know you need my help . and i know you know i need your help .	in my fifteen years as a homicide detective i 've never met a single soul as pushy and brazen as you are miss weathers .
please , call me gale .	deal , but i 'm still detective kincaid , ok ?
whoever it is , now is taking credit for maureen prescott 's murder .	but we know who killed maureen prescott , billy loomis and stu macher . i mean , they even told sidney how they did it !
four ? there are five .	ben damon . christine perkins . sarah darling . tom prinze . that 's four , last time i learned how to count .
ok , look . we all know that this has something to do with 'stab 3 ' . what we do not know is why the killer keeps leaving articles about maureen prescott .	actually , there was more this time . this time , we found a picture too .
boys , boys , why do n't we compare our gun calibers later ? the issue is maureen prescott !	wrong , this issue is sidney prescott ! and either mr. riley is going to obstruct justice or is going to put me in touch with her . so , where is she ?
jesus gale what happened ?	he killed milton ! the killer 's inside there ! oh god ! dewey ! dewey 's in there too ! he needs medical help ! he 's hurt !
the killer leaves a newspaper clipping at each murder , sidney . recently he 's also left a photo of your mother .	why did n't you tell me ? this is my mother , dewey . why did n't you say something ?
are you sure ?	absolutely .
what do you know about trilogies ?	you mean like , movie trilogies ?
you seem to like movies , detective .	call me mark , would you ? cause i 'm gon na keep calling you sidney .
i 'll call you mark when you catch the killer , detective .	all i know about movie trilogies is in the third one , all bets are off .
did you request this case ?	no , they tend to put me on the ones that deal with the business . i grew up here , and i know my way around the studios .
must be exciting , beautiful place , beautiful people .	to me hollywood is about death .
excuse me ?	i 'm a homicide detective , remember ? when you see what i see day in and day out , the violence that people do to each other , you get haunted . i think you know about that .
what do you mean ?	i know what it 's like to see ghosts that do n't go away . to be watching a scary movie in your head , whether you want to or not , watching it alone .
ghosts are tough , you ca n't shoot ghosts .	ca n't arrest ghosts . but the best way to stop being haunted is to be with people . you 're here , you 're not hiding , you 've done the right thing , miss prescott .
hmm .	what did you know about your mother ?
i used to think i had the perfect mom , perfect family . till i found out i was wrong . she had a secret life , and i tried to understand that , and soon as i thought i had , more secrets . i do n't ' know who my mom was . sometimes i feel like i 'm just learning about my mother for the first time . you know , with tv and those movies and what not . god sometimes i feel like i 'm just learning about myself for the first time . like i 'm watching my life instead of living in it .	here 's the deal , i 'm off to search the soundstage . that 's good news .
how is that good news ?	because , that means that we 're dealing with an ordinary , flesh and blood killer . and i know how to handle guys like that .
oh yeah , how ?	catch him , or kill him .
mr. rielly ? my name is mark kincaid . i 'm with the l.a.p.d . are you aware of last night 's events ?	yeah . a real tragedy .
that 's fine mr. rielly , but if anyone else should die , i 'm going to have to get a warrant .	understood . if you 'll excuse me detective . gale .
i told you , i do n't know where sidney is . and even if there was a third killer , sidney does n't know about it .	that is for me to decide . i need to talk to her mr. riley , she is a key element in this case . i have a press conference in an hour , and i need to explain why there are four dead celebrities .
what about angelina tyler ? she was there too .	police are still searching through the debris . could be days before we find her . . . that is , if she 's even there .
before you jump to conclusions , the man in the picture , cotton weary , is out of the country on business . his alibi checks out . seems he 's got a tv show in australia , 100 % cotton . it 's supposedly the biggest thing down under since yahoo serious , but that 's besides the point .	what does this have to do with sid ?
who knows more about maureen prescott than her own daughter ?	well sid 's dad could n't help you and he was married to maureen .
is that a threat , detective ?	when it 's a threat , you 'll know it .
detective kincaid ?	what rielly ?
nice to finally meet you , sidney .	the killer called her .
sidney , do you have any idea how he could 've gotten your number ?	he could 've monitored the calls on a scanner . did you call her from the set ?
jesus christ sidney , what happened ? i got a call on my cell from home . they told me that someone was attacked .	and what made you think it was sidney ?
what are you doing here ? i told you to stay hidden ! it 's not safe for you up here .	well it 's not safe for me up there either . the killer found me dewey . he called me last night .
what ?	i figured i 'd be safe if i was at least up here with the people i care about . now where 's this kincaid guy the news is talking about ? i found this place from a fox 5 tv news report . heh .
i was afraid they were bait , something to , ya know , trick you out of hiding .	listen , detective , i wan na see this studio where all this shit 's going down .
alright sid , over there is the stab 3 production offices . that 's where sarah darling was murdered last night .	mm , what a waste of silicone . what does my mother have to do with this all dewey ? we 're a long way from woodsboro .
karen colcheck . from woodsboro .	she was randy 's only girlfriend . . . ever .
i can see nothing 's changed .	no .
listen dewey i have to go to the bathroom .	do you want me to come with you sid ? i mean , remember what randy said ?
do n't worry , i 've got a permit for it .	jesus christ dewey help me ! they tried to kill me in the bathroom ! the killers !
yeah ?	help me sid ! the killer 's got me !
dewey ? ! ohmigod ! where are you ? !	sid i can see you !
where are you dewey ?	i 'm out back . tied up . hurry sid ! the killer 's looking for you ! quick untie me !
where 's gale ?	they 've got her !
dewey my god i thought you were dead .	do n't worry sid i 'd never leave you like that .
watch out sid . randy said the killer 's always superhuman .	he was n't superhuman dewey . he was n't superhuman at all .
dewey , personal lives and pasts aside , this is about sidney . we need to know where she is .	what so you can just exploit her again with another book ? sid does n't need you gale .
they found another note ?	uh-huh . another news clipping . another one about sid 's mom . dewey , whether we like it or not it looks like we 're going to have to go back into our past .
you mean our past as in me and sid . this has nothing to do with you gale .	this has everything to do with me dewey . i was the one who brought the nation 's attention to this shit anyway . i 'll be damned if i 'm gon na sit around and pass on the buck again .
do you really mean it this time gale ?	yes . look , let 's get something straight dewey , i got into this shit cause the police came looking for me . not cause i 'm out to make the sunrise studios slashings .
why would the police come to you ?	again , i am the author of the definitive book on the woodsboro murders. ! what about you ?
what about me ?	you said you 'd never leave woodsboro , 'the only place that 's real ! ' but now you 're here . not with me . dewey , i took care of you . i waited until you were well . i could n't stay there , i mean , it 's like dog years , one year in woodsboro is like seven everywhere else .
so it 's off to london for a week ? new york for a month ? l.a forever ?	it was fucking '60 minutes ii ' ! i could n't say no ! i could 've been the next diane sawyer !
what 's wrong with just being gale weathers ? i liked her !	it did n't work dewey . we tried , we 're different .
you used to say that was our strength .	dewey , you 're not just here because of that second rate k-mart , straight-to-video version of me , are you ?
brace yourself , gale , all of this is actually not about you .	all of what dewey ? you do know something , do n't you ?
off the record .	always .
two months ago , the woodsboro police got a call from a woman who said she was with 'stab 3 ' . she wanted to see the file on sid , for research .	and ?
the boys said no . she would n't give her name . a month later , the station gets broken into , the file room ransacked .	someone stole sid 's file ?
i already removed it . i think someone on the film was trying to find sid , and that 's the only reason i came here . to make do a little private investigating of my own and make sure no one here was planning anything .	i 'm sorry , this is too good !
what part of 'off the record ' do n't you understand ?	right . sorry . do you think he did it ?
i 've got my suspicions but still , nothing you say can ever make me take my eyes off one person .	and who is that ?
jennifer needs me .	jennifer ? ! wait , where are you going off to ?
stop following me .	i happen to work for the police god dammit !
you 're not a detective .	neither are you , magnum p.i .
gale , your engine 's still running .	fuck !
do n't worry . i 'm prepared for anything .	amen boy scout , now answer the fucking door !
oh . oh god . gale --	what ?
thank you .	sid , this is detective kincaid .
do you have her number stored in your memory ? phone memory !	oh . yeah , i guess i do .
has anyone else every used your phone ?	just jennifer . and you .
i 've got an idea , i 'll hook up with you guys later .	do you want us to come with you ?
sidney , what happened ?	nevermind , what 'd you two find ?
paternity test results . christ dewey , you 're never going to believe who milton 's kid is .	who is it ?
gale , i know this is a bad time and all but what if we try it out again . the whole relationship thing .	sure , why not . you did save my life , mr . rielly .
so you knew sidney prescott 's mother .	just what the hell do you people think you 're doing , barging in here like this ? i 've got important calls to make . i run this studio .
what 's your point ?	no point , i 'm just gon na give detective kincaid a call .
what the hell are you guys getting at ? i make horror films , that 's what i do . the studio came to me with 'stab ' . they came to me , check it out .	but you know who she was .
good morning gale . pleasure to be here .	it 's a pleasure to finally meet you , roman .
well it 's a honor to be here amongst so many fans of the genre . and i must say that any of you worried that jerry rapp , or tori or david not returning to complete the stab trilogy , have no fear , roman is here . aided with my excellent cast of newcomers i believe we 're going to pull off one of the best stabs yet .	roman , from your enthusiasm it certainly seems that way . honestly though , tell us , what's your favorite scary movie ?
your life ?	well if you were in my shoes , dealing with those big time sunrise studio producers like i do on a daily basis , you 'd watch how quick your life goes from a walt disney picture to a tobe hooper flick .
would you excuse me for a moment ?	sure .
you ! how can i ever get any fame playing you !	dewey , what the hell is she rambling about now ? what 's wrong jen , see yourself on one of those usa network winners you did and realize how badly you suck at acting ?
god damn you gale weathers ! do n't you see ? the killer is choosing his victims as they die in the script ! ben damon 's character was the first one to get offed . so was his girlfriend - but she was n't cast yet so his real girlfriend was killed - then sarah darling 's candy , and now me !	wait a second , whoa ! calm down ! number one there were five different versions of the script given out . ben damon was given a fake script because he was only being offered the role . it only had fragments of real scenes from the actual script . and what , i die in stab 3 ?
and i die naked ? ! ugh ! this is complete bullshit . who wrote this piece of crap ?	i know right . it was kinda weak . that 's cause will kennison only wrote a rough treatment of it . the script was written by some new guy . he wrote arlington street .
shit ! where the hell are tom and angelina ?	i do n't know . screw them . look , what 's important is that we stick together . no matter what . if anyone is next it 's you or me jen .
who 's phone ?	oh shit it 's my cell !
listen you sick bastard , what the fuck do you want ?	what 's your favorite scary movie gale ?
god damn it you two ! run ! hurry ! he 's dead !	no ! he 's not dead ! he 's still breathing ! look !
geez .	what the hell are you doing ?
being gale weathers . what the hell are you doing ?	i am gale weathers !
here 's how i see it . i 've got no house , no movie , no gun , and i 'm being stalked . because someone wants to kill me ? no , because someone wants to kill you . so now , starting now , i go where you go . that way , if someone wants to kill me , i 'll be with you , and since they really want to kill you , they wo n't kill me , they 'll kill you . make sense ?	none .
you know in the movies , i play you as being much smarter .	and as a sane person . for you that must be quite a stretch .
ha . maybe i should join snl .	need to get in that building ?
no really ?	there a story in that building ?
possibly .	gale weathers would find a way .
basements creep me out .	really , you know you 'd make a fascinating interview . lifestyles of the rich and psychotic .
look who 's talking moneybags . you got more homes than i do .	oh i wish i got that one on tape . it 'd put a smile on my face everytime i 'm down .
nobody said she was an actor .	good twist .
oh , come on ! you have made millions off the story of her murder . you 're obsessed with her and you 're obsessed with her daughter !	settle down beavis . why do n't you tell us the truth ?
i think milton 's the killer . i think he just went out to kill another cast member .	milton 's not a killer . he 's a pervert . he probably went out to buy more ky jelly for his jack -off parties he has with his two best friends .
rob reiner and quentin tarentino ?	do you get any of my witty humor ? i mean , you did play me for three movies . his two hands , dingus .
excuse me detective , i think we have some business to attend to .	gale weathers ? ! what are you doing here ? no press on the set ! no press , no press on set ! get that woman out of here .
well then , i guess i 'll be leaving then .	oh come on ! why the hostility ?
listen lois lane , i love your show and all but last month i happened to catch your little segment on me and how my wife left me because i 'm a sex addict who enjoys screwing fifteen year old girls . it was a real eye opener my lawyers are still thinking about bringing to your superior 's attentions .	they 're the ones who approved it .
answer the question . you knew sidney 's mom ?	who ?
and now ? i mean , murders on your set and still you say nothing ?	get real , that would make me a suspect !
just because you knew her ?	yeah .
i do n't think so ! just what happened to maureen when she was in hollywood ?	now you listen to me , lois lane , let it go . it 's dead and buried . daddy took ol ' yeller out behind the barn and shot him in the head a long time ago .
well how would you like his rotten carcass dug up and drug all over national tv ? why do n't you start talking .	it was in the 70 's , everything was different . i was well known for my parties , rina knew what they were . it was for girls like her to meet men , men who could get them parts , if they made the right impression . nothing happened to her that she did n't invite , in one way or another , no matter what she said afterwards .
are you saying she was-	i 'm saying things got out of hand . maybe they did take advantage of her ! . maybe the sad truth is , this is not the city for innocence . no charges were brought . and the bottom line is , rina reynolds would n't play by the rules . you wan na get ahead in hollywood , you got ta play the game , or go home .
gale weathers . what a surprise .	tom prinze , tanked as usual . that 's a shocker .
hey i really liked that piece you did on me last month . the one where you said my car accident was caused by me drinking and drugs , and how i faked the tire blow-out just so my insurance would n't sky rocket .	heh , well , that 's tv journalism for ya . stage the news to boost ratings .
i think we should go inside . i have to have a talk with the cast . all of you .	you mean what 's left of us . yeah i 'm running on empty anyways . got ta refuel .
oh my god ! sidney , you ran fast or what ? hey .	hi , gale . i 'm glad you 're all right .
what 'd he say ?	oh , you know , the usual small talk , `` what 's new , how ya been , how do you want to die ? ''
oh my god karen you scared the shit out of me ! what are you doing here ?	who 's this .
we did some researching in the archives . sid , something dawned on me when i wrote the book on your mother 's murder . for two years of her life , 1969 up until 1971 she basically disappeared off the face of the earth .	what are you talking about ?
gale he 's got dewey !	i know ! he killed kincaid !
i know !	let 's get out of here !
roman bridger , director . and brother . she slammed the door in my face , sid . said i was rina 's child and rina was dead . and it struck me , what a good idea ! so i watched her , made a little home movie , a little family film . seems maureen , mom , really got around . i mean , cotton weary was one thing , everybody knew about that , but billy 's father , that was the key ! your boyfriend did n't like seeing his daddy in my movies . did n't like it at all . and once i supplied the motive , all the kid needed was a few pointers . have a partner to sell out in case you get caught , find someone to frame , it was like her was making a movie .	all the nightmares . all the hell i went through was because of you , you spineless bastard !
i 'm a director sid , i direct . for example , angelina over there , she 's my partner . i can convince her to do anything . we 've been dating since i met her in woodsboro .	oh my god , angie crick ? from english class ?
listen , i have no time for this . i 've heard this shit before ! so lets get on with it !	wait a second sid . do n't you go jumping the gun . you have n't seen the best part . with the aides of the computer revolution of y2ki 've been able to steal your voice . ai n't it cool ? listen to what the police are gon na find next to your lifeless , mutilated body .
see sid , now comes the part where we get away with it ! the part where we win ! cause face it sidney , in this world , the bad guys win !	roman knock it off ! do you people even know why you kill people ? you kill people cause you choose to and not because of any other fucking reason !
oh shit . hello ? director 's office .	sarah , it 's roman , i 'm sorry i 'm running late , i 'm still on the 405 , i 'm about 10 minutes away .
all right , since i got you on the phone , let 's talk about your character .	what character ? i 'm candy , the chick who gets killed second . i 'm only in two scenes !
you 're not happy with your part .	i 'm not happy that i 'm 35 playing a 21 year old . i 'm not happy that i have to die naked ! and i 'm not happy that my character is too stupid not to have a gun in the house after her boyfriend 's been cut into mcnuggets .
um hmm ... umhmm great , so let 's run the lines .	huh , fine .
page 22 , candy 's big moment .	page 22.. ring ring . hello ?
hello .	who 's this ?
who 's this ?	this is candy . hang on , let me get some clothes . see ! i do n't ' understand why i have to start the scene in the shower ! the whole shower things been done , 'vertigo ' hello ! and i mean , my boyfriend just died , why am i showering ?
why do n't we just read the scene ? candy , is that like candy cane or candy apple ?	whatever . come on , who is this ? i think you have the wrong number .
but you know my favorite name ?	i 'm hanging up right now .
it 's sarah .	roman that 's not the line .
it is in my script .	has there been another goddamn rewrite ? how the fuck are we supposed to learn our lines when there 's a new script every 15 minutes ?
it 's not just a new script , it 's a new movie .	what ? what movie ?
goddamnit i am getting so fed up with these re-writes . it 's like every five minutes there 's a new script . god , and you just know this all because of stab 2 's script winding up on the internet two months after it wrapped shooting .	and still the film is number one at the box office this weekend . beat out american pasty and arlington street .
what are you talking about ? the murders were a completely isolated incident .	scene 32. int . candy 's living room - night . `` what are you talking about ricky , the murders were a completely isolated incident '' .
would you give that script a rest ? it 's like a friggen umbilical cord to you .	i 'm just saying , though . what if there 's someone out there stalking actors ? huh ? then what ?
roman and everybody else went home for the night . i 'm here for a make-up test .	make-up . you need it . hey , roman is n't here ?
no .	damn . he called my roommate and told her he had some important things he wanted to go over with me in his office tonight .
do you think it 's over sidney ? do you ?	w-what do you want ?
i want to finish what i started . i want to finish the game .	you sick fuck i 'm tracing this call as we speak ! the police are gon na nail your ass !
let them try . you 'll never find me . i 've already gotten away with murder before . for instance , maureen prescott .	no . you did n't kill my mother . billy loomis and stu macher did .
heh . so you think sidney . so you think . it 's all been building up to this sid . every stab . every scream . every ounce of blood that 's been spilled has all been leading up to this moment . welcome tothe final act .	the final act ? well let 's play asshole !
if you lay a hand on him i 'll fucking kill you !	great . a spirited one . i 'll be seeing you real soon sidney . real soon .
{ a click } i only her you too , sidney .	who is this ?
do n't do it ! if you do one thing to attract attention , one thing , i 'll kill them both . now , do you have somewhere we can be alone ?	yes .
always hard being friends with you , sidney . when you 're friends with sidney , you die ! well these friends do n't have to , sidney . it 's up to you .	how do i know their voices are --
you 're dead !	i do n't want them , i want you ! it 's simple . you show yourself , they survive , you run , they die !
where ?	she 'd have been so happy , sidney , to know we 'd be together .
where ?	i 'll call you , when you 're on your way .
yeah ?	you follow directions good . now let 's wrap this production . go to the sunrise studios backlot . i 'll call you when you get there .
alright , i 'm here . now what ?	you 're doing real good . ca n't you figure it out ? i wan na finish this where it all began . woodsboro .
alright i 'm here , now show your face so we can finish this .	it 's good to see you again sidney . i was growing real impatient . go ahead . explore . i 'll catch up with you later .
hello ?	yes , hi i 'm laura , i 'm a trained counselor . how can i help you .
laura i think i just killed somebody .	are you sure ?
uh-huh i 'm sure . i 've killed someone ! oh my god i 've actually killed someone !	well then the people you need to call are the police .
no i need to call you . just you .	i 'm sorry , your voice .
do n't you want to know how you can help , sidney ? are you listening to me , huh ?	who the fuck is this ?
what ? she asked .	it 's called tact , you fuckrag .
i did n't kill anybody .	no one 's saying you did .
owwww ...	you open your mouth and stupidity pours out .
how 'd you do ?	piece of cake . she 'll be there .
thanks , butt wart . you did good .	so you gon na try and make up with sid ?
duh ... that 's quick .	i was just asking . why are you always at me ?
because i 'm trying to build your self-esteem . you 're far too sensitive .	oh ...
you ready to party hard tonight ?	you know it .
dude . what are you doing here ?	i was hoping sid and i could talk .
where ya going ? it 's not over yet . we 've got one more surprise -- stu , i believe it 's your turn .	oh yeah .
you have to play , sid . do n't want to disappoint your dad . he 's been waiting around all night .	it 's an easy game . we ask you a question . if you get it wrong -- you die .
tell that to cotton weary . you would n't believe how easy it was to frame him .	yeah , we just watched a few movies . took a few notes . it was fun .
nope .	and did they really ever explain why hannibal lecter liked to eat people ? do n't think so . you see , it 's scarier when there 's no motive , sid .
think about it . on the off chance i get caught -- a motive like that could divide a jury for years , do n't you think ? . you took my mother , so i took yours . big sympathy factor . maternal abandonment causes serious deviant behavior . it certainly fucked you up . it made you have sex with a psychopath .	that 's right and now that you 're no longer a virgin . you got ta die -- those are the rules .
this is the best part , sid . billy 's got it all figured out . why do you think we kept your father alive so long ? why did we save you for last ?	you know what time it is , sid ? it 's after midnight . it 's your mother 's anniversary . we killed her exactly one year ago today .
ready ?	yeah ...
what if your father snapped ? your mom 's anniversary set him off and he went on a murder spree , killing everyone ...	except for me and billy ... we were left for dead ...
and then he killed you and then shoots himself in the head . it 's a perfect ending .	everyone dies but us . we get to carry on and plan the sequel . let 's face it , these days -- you got ta have a sequel .
that 's it , billy . i ca n't take any more . i 'm feeling woozy .	get the gun . i 'll untie pops .
it 's on the table .	no , it 's not .
i thought she was dead .	she looked dead . still does .
she ca n't get both of us .	odds are -- she 'll miss anyway .
i do n't know billy but i 'm hurtin ' .	where the fuck did she go ?
find her you dipshit !	i ca n't ... i 'm bad off , billy . you cut too deep .
thank you , hank . we 're on it . what were you doing out at sidney 's tonight ?	i just wanted to see her , that 's all .
you rode your bike out there ?	yes , sir .
did you ride past casey becker 's house ?	no , i did n't . i did n't kill anyone , sheriff .
billy ? what the ...	i 'm sorry . do n't hate me .
what are you doing here ?	you sleep in that ?
my dad 's in the other room .	i 'll only stay a sec .
close call .	what are you doing here ?
it just occurred to me that i 've never snuck through your bedroom window .	now that it 's out of your system .
and i was home , bored , watching television , the exorcist was on and it got me thinking of you .	oh it did ?
yeah , it was edited for tv . all the good stuff was cut out and i started thinking about us and how two years ago , we started off kinda hot and heavy , a nice solid `` r '' rating on our way to an nc17 . and how things have changed and , lately , we 're just sot of ... edited for television .	so you thought you could sneak in my window and we would have a little bump-bump .
you know what my dad will do to you ?	i 'm going ... i 'm going .
would you settle for a pg-13 relationship ?	what 's that ?
oh billy ... please ... god ...	i heard screaming . the door was locked . are you okay ...
jesus , shit !	hey , hey , it 's just me .
no ... i do n't ... it 's just ... oh god , billy , someone was there , someone tried to kill me .	the police say i scared him off . it was n't me , sid .
i know . he called again last night at tatum 's house .	see , it could n't have been me . i was in jail , remember ?
i 'm so sorry ... please understand .	understand what ? that i got a girlfriend who would rather accuse me of being a psychopathic killer than touch me .
you know that 's not true .	then what is it ? is there somebody else ?
no ...	is it the sex thing ? am i being too pushy ?
no , it 's me , billy . i need time . i 'm still adjusting to my mom .	it 's been a year since she died .
tomorrow . one year tomorrow .	when are you gon na let that go , sid ? when my mom left my dad -- i just accepted it . this is the way it is . she 's not coming back .
your parents split up . it 's not the same thing . your mom left town , she 's not in a coffin somewhere .	you have to move on , sid .
subtlety , stu . look it up .	it 's okay . we need to talk .
so ...	so ... i 'm sorry . i 've been a selfish shit and i 'm sorry .
no , billy . i 'm the one who 's been selfish and self-absorbed with all of my post traumatic stress .	you lost your mom ...
i think in some weird analytical , psychological bullshit way i 'm scared i 'm gon na turn out just like her , you know ? like the bad seed or something ...	oh sidney ...
everytime i get close to you i see my mom . i know it does n't make sense .	sure it does . it 's like jodie foster in silence of the lambs when she kept having flashbacks of her dead father .
but this is life . this is n't a movie .	sure it is , sid . it 's all a movie . life 's one great big movie . only you ca n't pick your genre .
i wan na let go . i do ...	ssshh ... everything 's gon na be okay . i promise .
sshh ... it 's okay .	or even a good porno .
you heard me .	are you serious ?
who did you call ?	what ?
when you 're arrested -- you 're allowed one phone call ? who did you call ?	i called my dad .
no , sheriff burke called your dad . i saw him .	yeah ... and when i called no one answered .
uh-huh .	you do n't still think it was me ?
i thought you were ...	i 'm alright . got ta ... get ... help .
no ! do n't believe him .	it 's okay . give me the gun .
it 's called guess how i 'm going to die !	fuck you .
why did you kill my mother ?	why ? why ? did you hear that , stu ? i think she wants a motive . hmmm ... i do n't really believe in motives , sid . i mean , did norman bates have a motive ?
i do n't understand ...	we did your mom a favor , sid . the woman was a slut bag whore who flashed her shit all over town like she was sharon stone or something .
jesus ... fuck , that hurt .	stop it !
hello ?	are you alone in the house ?
you bitch -- where the fuck are you ?	not so fast . we 're gon na play a little game . it 's called guess who just called the police and reported your sorry motherfucking ass ?
i 'm gon na rip you up bitch . just like your slut whore mother .	got ta find me first , you pansy-assed mama 's boy .
yes .	who is this ?
who are you trying to reach ?	what number is this ?
what number are you trying to reach ?	i do n't know .
i think you have the wrong number .	do i ?
hello .	i 'm sorry . i guess i dialed the wrong number .
so why did you dial it again ?	to apologize .
you 're forgiven . bye now .	wait , wait , do n't hang up .
what ?	i want to talk to you for a second .
hello .	why do n't you want to talk to me ?
who is this ?	you tell me your name , i 'll tell you mine .
i do n't think so .	what 's that noise ?
popcorn .	you 're making popcorn ?
uh-huh .	i only eat popcorn at the movies .
i 'm getting ready to watch a video .	really ? what ?
just some scary movie .	do you like scary movies ?
uh-huh .	what 's your favorite scary movie ?
i do n't know .	you have to have a favorite .
uh ... halloween . you know , the one with the guy with the white mask who just sorta walks around and stalks the baby sitters . what 's yours ?	guess .
uh ... nightmare on elm street .	is that the one where the guy had knives for fingers ?
yeah ... freddy krueger .	freddy -- that 's right . i liked that movie . it was scary .
the first one was , but the rest sucked .	so , you got ta boyfriend ?
why ? you wan na ask me out ?	maybe . do you have a boyfriend ?
no .	you never told me your name .
why do you want to know my name ?	because i want to know who i 'm looking at .
what did you say ?	i want to now who i 'm talking to .
that 's not what you said .	what do you think i said ?
i have to go now .	wait ... i thought we were gon na go out .
nah , i do n't think so ...	do n't hang up on me .
got ta go .	do n't ...
yes ?	i told you not to hang up on me .
what do you want ?	to talk .
dial someone else , okay ?	you getting scared ?
listen , asshole ...	no , you listen , you little bitch . if you hang up on me again i 'll gut you like a fish . understand ?
is this some kind of a joke ?	more of a game , really .
i 'm two seconds from calling the police .	they 'd never make it in time .
what do you want ?	to see what your insides look like .
look , enough is enough . you had your fun now you better leave me alone or else .	or else what ?
my boyfriend will be here any second and he 'll be pissed when i tell him ...	i thought you did n't have a boyfriend .
i lied . i do have a boyfriend and he 'll be here any second and your ass better be gone .	sure ...
i swear it . and he 's big and plays football and will beat the shit out of you .	i 'm getting scared .
i 'm telling you the truth . i lied before ...	i believe you ...
so you better leave .	his name would n't be steve , would it ?
how do you know his name ?	go to the back door and turn on the porch light -- again .
where are you ?	guess .
please do n't hurt him .	that all depends on you .
i wan na play a game .	no ...
then he dies . right now .	nooo !
what kind of game ?	turn off the light .
please do n't do this ...	come on . it 'll be fun .
no ... please .	it 's an easy category . movie trivia .
... please ...	i 'll even give you a warm up question .
do n't do this . i ca n't ...	name the killer in halloween .
no ...	come on . it 's you favorite scary movie , remember ? he had a white mask , he stalked the baby-sitters .
i do n't know ...	come on , yes you do .
what 's his name ?	i ca n't think .
michael ... michael myers .	yes !
now for the real question .	noooo ... .
but you 're doing so well .	please go away ! leave us alone !
... please ... no ...	name the killer in friday the 13th .
i 'm sorry . that 's the wrong answer .	no it 's not . it was jason .
afraid not .	it was jason . i saw that goddamned movie twenty times . it was jason .
you tricked me ...	lucky , for you there 's a bonus round . but poor steve ... i 'm afraid ... he 's out .
... leave me alone ... please ...	answer the question and i will .
what door am i at ?	what ?
do n't make me ... i ca n't ... i wo n't .	your call .
hi ! gale weathers . field correspondent , inside story .	i know who you are , ma'am . how 's the eye ?
productive . so they 're closing down the school ?	well ... uh ... yes ma'am . for the time being .
and why is that ? has something happened ?	you 're not supposed to be here , ma'am .
i 'm twenty-five years old , ma'am .	twenty-five , huh ? in a demographic study i proved to be most popular amongst males , 11-24. i just missed you . of course , you do n't look a day over twelve , except in the upper torso area . does the force require that you work out ?
boy , you people sure do make fuss over a serial killer .	serial killer is not really accurate , ma'am . the killer has yet to strike twice .
well , we can hope , ca n't we ? we certainly do n't have any leads . a ghost mask , a cellular phone -- not much there .	we 're tracking the cellular phone bill .
really ? you small town guys are good . and have you located sidney 's father ?	no , not yet .
he 's not a suspect , is he ?	we have n't ruled out that possibil ...
if you 'll excuse me , ma'am .	am i keeping you ? i 'm sorry .
i just turned 25. i was 24 for a whole year .	you are precious . please , call me gale .
evening , ma'am .	deputy ... good evening .
what brings you out to these parts ?	you never know when or where a story will break .
not much story here . just a bunch of kids cutting loose .	then what are you doing here ?
keeping an eye on things . checking the place out .	mind if i join you ?
sheriff just radioed me . i 'm gon na check out a possible lead . thought you might like to join me .	what kind of lead ?
a car was spotted in the bushes a little ways up the road .	i 'd love to . if you 're sure it 's alright ?
ma'am , i am the deputy of this town .	can i bring kenny ?
so is dewey your real name ?	dwight . dewey was something i got stuck with a long time ago .
i like it . it 's ... sexy .	nah ... it 's just this town 's way of not taking me serious .
people treat me like the antichrist of television journalism .	i do n't think you 're so bad .
shit . it 's neil prescott 's car .	sidney 's father ?
i 'll call for backup .	i 'll get my camera .
what are you doing here ?	oh , god , sid , i 'm sorry i was late .
does mom know ?	yes , you doofus .
hey ... dewey . can we go now ?	hold up a sec ...
what did mama tell you ? when i wear this badge you treat me like a man of the law .	i 'm sorry , deputy dewey-boy but we 're ready to go .
a party ? mom 's gon na kill you . then me .	do n't be so self-righteous . it 's just a little blow out -- we 'll be perfectly safe .
no , dewey . you 'll ruin the whole night .	sorry , police orders . i 'll stay out of the way , i promise .
what is she doing here ?	she 's with me . i just wanted to check on things .
you gon na be able to come down to the station and talk to us a bit ?	... yeah ...
did you reach my dad ?	you 're sure it was the hilton ?
at the airport .	he 's not registered . could he have gone to another hotel ?
i do n't know . i guess .	we 'll find him , sid . do n't worry .
any word on my dad ?	not yet , but we 're looking . if you need anything ...
billy was released . his cellular bill was clean . he did n't make those calls .	somebody called me , dewey . i 'm not making it up .
i know . we 're checking every cellular account in the county . any calls made to you or casey becker are being cross-referenced . it 's gon na take time but we 'll find him .	and my dad ? any word on him ?
god , look at this place , it 's the town that dreaded sundown .	hey , i saw that movie . true story , 'bout some killer in texas .
i see you as a young meg ryan myself .	thanks , dewey . but with my luck they 'd cast tori spelling .
you girls ready .	yeah .
have they found my father ?	afraid not .
should i be worried ?	not yet .
it 's deputy riley today , sid .	how is everything ?
we got him , sheriff . billy loomis .	hank loomis ' kid ? aw ... jesus ...
i was first to respond .	what were you doing out here ?
drive by patrol .	how is she ?
she 's tough .	have to be . the shit she 's gone through .
that ghost mask is sold at both kroger 's and walmart . neither of which keep purchase records .	what about the cellular phone bill ?
they 're pulling loomis ' account . but it 'll be morning before we see something . you think he did it ?	twenty years ago i woulda said not a chance . but these kids today ... damn if i know .
she staying with you ?	we have n't located her dad yet .
she 's okay . looks like some boys were teasing her . himbry 's shutting down the school though . i want you to take look around .	yes , sir , sheriff .
dewey ! where the hell you been , boy ?	keeping my eye on sidney .
listen up , dewey , because it 's bad . real bad . aircomp just faxed us . the calls were listed to neil prescott -- sidney 's father . he made the calls with his cellular phone . it 's confirmed .	could n't his cellular number have been cloned ?
there 's more . guess what tomorrow is ? the anniversary of his wife 's death . it all fits . he 's our man .	have you contacted the bureau ?
they believe he 's out of state by now . we 'll keep roadblocks and curfew in effect through the night . if he 's not picked up by morning -- we 'll do a house to house .	you think he could still be in town ?
he 'd have to be crazy . where 's sidney ?	she 's with my sister . should i bring her in ?
hold off for now . just stay close to her .	she 'll be with her friends over at stu maker 's tonight .
watch her . do n't let on -- just keep your eyes out .	yes , sir .
that fish smelled strong .	i told you to send it back .
jesus ...	what is it ? where 's casey ?
where is she ?	call the police .
casey ? where are you honey ? call the police , goddamnit .	the phone 's dead .
where is she ?	i can hear her . oh mother of god , i can hear her .
casey ! casey !	not my daughter ... not my ...
what ? what ?	jesus ! the camera-hurry !
jesus christ ! an innocent man on death row . a killer still on the loose . kenny , tell me i 'm dreaming .	you want to go live ?
no , not so fast . we have nothing concrete .	when did that ever stop you ? you ca n't sit on this . this is huge .
if i 'm gon na blow this up -- i need hard proof .	but it 's so much easier when we make it up .
what 's the plan ?	prep the compact , we 'll hide it in a window and tape all of tonight 's festivities .
the control board 's glitched . you know we ca n't carry a live picture .	what 's the delay ?
about thirty seconds .	as long as it records i do n't give a shit . we 're not doing a remote .
it 's okay , tatum . she 's just doing her job . right , gale ?	yes , that 's right .
how 's the book ?	it 'll be out later this year .
i 'll look for it .	i 'll send you a copy .
i 'm not here to fight .	just stay back .
i want to talk to you .	kenny . camera . now .
off the record . no cameras .	forget it .
please . you owe me .	i owe you shit .
you owe my mother .	your mother 's murder was last year 's hottest court case . somebody was gon na write a book about it .
and it had to be you with all your lies and bullshit theories .	what is your problem ? you got what you wanted . cotton weary is in jail . they 're gon na gas him . a book is not gon na change that .
he was convicted in a court of law . your testimony put him away . it does n't matter what i think .	during the trial , you did all those stories about me . you called me a liar .
i think you falsely identified him . yes .	have you talked to cotton ?
many times .	has his story changed ?
not one word . he admits to having sex with your mother but that 's all .	he 's lying . she would n't have touched him . he raped her , then butchered her . her blood was all over his coat .
he was drunk that night . he left his coat at your house , after your mother seduced him ...	i saw him leaving wearing it .
she was never attacked . i think she made it all up .	why would she lie about it ?
what if she did it ? what if sidney killed casey and steve ?	and why would she do that ?
why would sidney want to be with steve ? she has her own bubble-butt boyfriend billy .	maybe she 's a slut just like her mom .
you 're evil .	please , it 's common knowledge . her mother was a trollop .
cut some slack . she watched her mom get butchered .	and it fucked her up royally . think about it . it makes perfect sense . her mom 's death leaves her distraught and hostile at a cruel and inhumane world , she 's disillusioned , where 's god , etc . completely suicidal . and one day she snaps . she wants to kill herself but realizes teen suicide is out this year . and homicide is a much healthier therapeutic expression .
where do you get this shit ?	ricki lake .
i have no idea .	scary night , is n't it ? with the murders and all , it 's like right out of a horror movie or something .
aha , randy , you gave yourself away . are you calling from work ? tatum 's on her way over .	do you like scary movies , sidney ?
i like that thing you 're doing with your voice , randy . it 's sexy .	what 's your favorite scary movie ?
do n't start . you know i do n't watch that shit .	and why is that ?
are you alone in the house ?	that is so unoriginal . you disappoint me , randy .
maybe that 's because i 'm not randy .	so who are you ?
the question is not who am i. the question is where am i ?	so where are you ?
why would you call me from my front porch ?	that 's the original part .
so where are you ?	right here .
can you see me right now ?	uh-huh .
good try , randy . tell tatum to hurry . bye now .	if you hang up , you 'll die just like your mother .
hello ?	hello sidney .
poor billy-boyfriend . an innocent guy does n't stand a chance with you .	leavemealone !
looks like you fingered the wrong guy ... again .	who are you ?
are you okay ?	can you knock ?
i heard screaming .	no you did n't .
no ? oh , well ... i 'm hitting the sack . my flight leaves first thing in the morning . now the expo runs all weekend so i wo n't be back til sunday . there 's cash on the table and i 'll be staying at the raleigh hilton ...	... out at the airport ...
... so call if you need me .	got it .
have a good trip .	sleep tight , sweetie .
stu was with me last night .	oooooh ... before or after he sliced and diced .
fuck you , nut case . where were you last night ?	working , thank you .
i thought blockbuster fired you .	twice .
the fog , terror train , prom night -- how come jamie lee curtis is in all these movies ?	she 's the scream queen .
stop . right there .	do n't shoot . it 's me .
do n't come any closer .	listen to me , sid . i found tatum . she 's dead , she 's been killed ... i think stu did it .
only if it 's a nice meg ryan movie .	you got it .
that was an ice pick -- not exactly the same .	yeah , casey and steve were completely hollowed out . takes a man to do something like that .
for about two seconds .	before she dumped him for steve .
and are the police aware you dated the victim ?	what are you saying ? that i killed her or something ?
besides -- `` takes a man to do something like that . ''	i 'm gon na gut your ass in a second .
jesus , this place is packed .	we had a run in the mass murder section .
you coming tonight ?	yeah , i 'm off early -- curfew you know . now that 's poor taste .
if you were the only suspect in a senseless bloodbath would you be standing in the horror section ?	it was all a misunderstanding . he did n't do anything .
you 're such a little lap dog . he 's got killer printed all over his forehead .	the why 'd the police let him go ?
why would he want to kill his own girlfriend ?	there 's always some stupid bullshit reason to kill your girlfriend . that 's the beauty of it all . simplicity . besides , if it 's too complicated you lose your target audience .
so what 's his reason ?	maybe sidney would n't have sex with him .
she 's saving herself for you .	could be . now that billy 's tried to mutilate her , you think sid would go out with me ?
i think her father did it . how come they ca n't find his ass ?	because he 's probably dead . his body will come popping out in the last reel somewhere ... eyes gauged . see , the police are always off track with this shit , if they 'd watch prom night they 'd save time . there 's formula to it . a very simple one . everyone 's always a suspect -- the father , the principal , the town derelict ...
which is you ...	so while they 're off investigating a dead end , billy , who 's been written off as a suspect , is busy planning his next hunting expedition .
you 're absolutely right . i 'm the first to admit it . if this were a scary movie , i 'd be the prime suspect .	and what would be your motive ?
i thought everything was checked out .	i had 'em hid in the foreign section .
we could be like two grief stricken students and we 'll say really nice things about our good friends who were slaughtered senselessly .	i can cry on cue .
what 's leatherface doing here ?	he came to make up .
there goes my chance with sid .	like you had one .
i wan na see jamie lee 's breasts . when do we see jamie lee 's breasts ?	not until trading places in '83 . jamie lee was always the virgin in horror movies . she did n't show her tits until she went legit .
there are certain rules that one must abide by in order to successfully survive a horror movie . for instance : 1. you can never have sex . the minute you get a little nookie -- you 're as good as gone . sex always equals death . 2. never drink or do drugs . the sin factor . it 's an extension of number one . and 3. never , ever , ever , under any circumstances , say `` i 'll be right back . ''	wan na another beer ?
yeah .	i 'll be right back .
his movie nut mind has snapped , sid . he 's gone psycho .	do n't listen to him . it 's him . he 's the one .
come on , sid . give me the gun .	no , sid .
you heard billy -- shut the fuck up .	hey , stu ? did n't you use to date casey ?
why are they doing this ?	are you kidding ? this is like christmas .
and to celebrate this impromptu fall break , i propose we have a party . tonight , my house .	are you serious ?
remember , there 's safety in numbers .	yeah , okay ... whatever .
if tatum sees you -- she 'll draw blood .	you guys can go up to my parents room ? to talk and ... whatever .
guess , i wo n't be needing this anymore .	why are you doing this ?
you 're crazy -- both of you .	the official term is `` psychotic '' .
so stu , what 's your motive ? billy 's got one . the police are on their way . what are you going to tell them ?	peer pressure ... i 'm way to sensitive .
do you believe this shit ?	what happened ?
oh god ! you do n't know ? casey becker and steve forrest were killed last night .	no way .
and not just killed , sid . we 're talking splatter movie killed-split open end to end .	casey becker ? she sits next to me in english .
not anymore . her parents found her hanging from a tree . her insides on the outside .	do they know who did it ?
fucking clueless -- they 're interrogating the entire school . teachers , students , staff , janitors ...	they think it 's school-related ?
or a man 's mentality .	how do you gut someone ?
you sure i can stay over ? my dad wo n't be back til sunday .	no prob . i 'll pick you up after practice .
tell your mom i said thanks .	yeah , yeah ... are you okay ?
uh-huh , it 's just ... you know , the police and reporters ... it brings it all back .	i 'll be there by seven . i promise
thanks , tatum .	later .
practice ran late . i 'm on my way .	it 's past seven .
do n't worry . casey and steve did n't bite it til way after ten .	i 'm not worried .
good , 'cause i wan na swing by blockbuster and get us a video . i was thinkin ' tom cruise in all the right moves . you know , if you pause it just right you can see his penis .	whatever . just hurry .
it 's okay . she was supposed to pick me up .	her dad 's out of town . she 's staying with us .
just another sleepover at the riley 's .	just like old times , ai n't it ?
do you really think billy did it ?	he was there , tatum .
take a message .	it 's alright . i 'll get it .
come on , sid .	just a sec ... i need to talk to someone .
just relax . you 're at school now . no one can get you here .	but if it was n't billy it could be anybody . he could be here at school right now .
this is a mistake . i should n't be here .	i want you to meet me here right after class , okay ?
shit , what is he doing here ?	i bet he 's pissed .
it was just some sick fuck having a laugh .	it was him , tatum . i know it .
this could be good . what do you think , sid ?	i do n't know ...
maybe cotton weary is telling the truth . maybe he was having an affair with your mom .	so you think my mom was a slut too ?
i did n't say that , sid . but you know there were rumors . your dad was always out of town on business . maybe your mom was a very unhappy woman .	if they were having an affair how come that cotton could n't prove it in court ?
you ca n't prove a rumor . that 's why it 's a rumor .	created by that little tabloid twit gale weathers .
it goes further back , sid . there 's been talk about other men .	and you believe it ?
if i was wrong cotton , then he 's still out there .	do n't go there , sid . you 're starting to sound like some wes carpenter flick . do n't freak yourself out -- we 've got a long night ahead of us .
you 're right . i 'm cracking up . ignore me .	come on , let 's rock .
hey , sid . just think if they make a movie about you . who 's gon na play you ?	oh , god ...
is billy going to be there tonight ?	he better not be . i told stu to keep his mouth shut . i think we can live without everybody 's all american for one night .
billy 's right . whenever he touches me , i just ca n't relax .	you have a few intimacy issues as a result of your mother 's untimely death . it 's no big deal . you 'll thaw out .
but he 's been so patient with me , tatum . you know , with all the sex stuff . how many guys would put up with a girlfriend who 's sexually anorexic ?	billy and his penis do n't deserve you .
what do you think about when you 're having sex ?	with stu , there 's little time to stop and reflect . but sometimes before , to relax and get in the mood , i think about grant goodeve .
who ?	grant goodeve -- the oldest brother on eight is enough . remember that show ? he was the one who lived off alone . he would come around every now and then with his guitar and sing `` eight is enough to fill our lives with love ... '' he had all these brain dead sisters and that idiot brother from charles in charge . god , i was in love with grant , he was so hot . the show came on every day after school right during my puberty years . grant goodeve was very instrumental in my maturing as a woman .
how does that get you in the mood with stu ?	during foreplay , i sing the theme song to myself . `` eight is enough to fill our lives with love ... '' it 's a real turn on .
no way .	grant wrote the song himself . i 'm convinced the lyrics had a secret meaning , `` eight is enough ... ''
what secret meaning ? like a satanical thing ?	watch the show , sid . his basket is bigger than the one you 're pushing .
tatum !	oh , sidney . what ? a guy can talk tits til he 's dead but the minute you mention an eight inch weenie . watch out .
there 's that sense of humor . i knew it still existed . ohh , sid , let 's have some fun tonight .	deal .
hunt ? why would they ask if you like to hunt ?	i do n't know , they just did .
because there 's no way a girl could have killed them .	that is so sexist . the killer could easily be female -- basic instinct .
i thought you dumped her for me .	i did . he 's full of shit .
you know if i were accused of carving up two people , i 'd take the opportunity to skip school .	hey , go easy , tatum . he did n't do it .
is this not cool or what ? hey , sid , what happened ?	for once , stu , drop it .
that 's mature .	where you guys been ? we had to start without you .
with that set of lungs -- she should be .	tits -- see .
i got it . tatum get me a beer . they 're in the fridge in the garage .	what am i ? the beer wench ?
i do n't have anyone else to give this to , somerset , you know that . and nobody 's going to swap with you .	give it to me .
how 's that ?	there 's nothing that says i have to work with him . if somerset wants out , `` goodbye . '' give it to me .
that 's not necessary . you 're in .	thank you .
he cuts off the skin if his fingertips . that 's why we ca n't find a single usable print in the apartment . he 's been doing it for quite a while . keeps cutting before the papillary line can grow back .	what about the trace on his bank account and the guns ? there must be something to connect him with a past .
you do n't . it goes to court now .	he would n't just turn himself in . it does n't make any sense .
he 's pissing in our faces again and we 're just taking it .	you 're wound too tight , mills . let it go .
how is it working for a scumbag like this ? you proud of yourself ?	ease back , mills .
what do you think ?	i 'm in .
`` dear detectives , long is the way , and hard , that out of hell leads up to light . '' it 's the murderer 's way of announcing himself .	announcing what ?
there are seven deadly sins . gluttony , wrath , greed ...	so what ? this victim ...
... envy , sloth , pride and lust . seven .	hey , so gluttony is one of the seven deadly sins . but , this was a fat guy . the killer may have felt this was the just best way to torture him . and , writing on the walls happens all the time . it 's like the fashionable thing to do .
what 's this : `` i 'm declining this case ? '' it do n't work that way .	this ca n't be my last duty here . it will go on and on .
you 've left unfinished business before .	everything else was taken as close to conclusion as humanly possible . also ... this should n't be his first assignment .
have you heard ?	no , i have n't heard .
already .	greed . it was written in blood .
it 's none of my business anymore .	i thought you might want to be filled in .
i 'm sure everyone 's doing their best .	yeah .
come on . what are you going to do with yourself out there ?	i 'll get a job , maybe on a farm . i 'll work on the house .
ca n't you feel it yet ? ca n't you feel that feeling ... ? you 're not going to be a cop anymore .	what are you talking about ?
did you read in the paper today , about the man who was walking his dog ? he was attacked , and his wallet and his watch were taken . and then , while he was still lying unconscious , his attacker stabbed him with a knife in both eyes . it happened four blocks from here .	i heard .
i have no understanding of this place anymore .	it 's always been like this .
well , there he sits . it 's not supposed to make sense .	he 's not finished .
how you feeling ?	i can breathe withour pain now , so i guess i feel great .
thank you . tell them , thank you .	we figure you need all the tools you can get to fix up that piece of shit you call a house .
they 're hoping you stop and say goodbye before you go , but i told them not to expect it .	it would be too hard .
he 's being arraigned tomorrow .	i read about it in the paper .
i guess ... decide for yourself . i do n't know what it says . i 'm going to go .	i 'll see you .
and ... and ... and he said ... he asked me if i was married . and , i could see he had a gun in his hand .	where was the girl ?
what ? what ?	where was the prostitute ? where was she ?
she was ... she was on the bed . she was just sitting on the bed .	who tied her down ? you or him ?
jesus christ , man , do n't shoot me !	turn around . hands on your head !
what the hell 's going on ?	who are you ? what are you doing out here ?
this guy paid me five hundred bucks to bring it out here . he wanted it here at exactly seven o'clock .	put it down . put it on the ground .
i do n't believe it .	hello .
what do you mean ?	i mean , at this point , what would it hurt if you told us a little about yourself ?
what 's so exciting ?	it 's not too far away now .
what time is it ?	why ?
it 's surprising how easily a member of the press can purchase information from the men in your precinct .	david ... please ...
give me the gun .	her pretty head .
you did n't know .	no !
where we headed ?	you 'll see .
we 're not just going to pick up two more bodies , are we , johnny ? that would n't be ... shocking enough . would n't keep you on the front page of the newspapers .	wanting people to pay attention , you ca n't just tap them on the shoulder . you have to hit them in the head with a sledgehammer . then , you have their strict attention .
what makes you so special that people should pay attention ?	not me . i 'm not special . i 'm not exceptional . this is , though . what i 'm doing .
i hate to burst your bubble , but other than the fact that you 're especially sadistic , there 's nothing unusual about these precious murders of yours .	you know that 's not true .
you ca n't see the whole ... the whole complete act yet . not yet . but , when this is done , it 's going to be ... so ... so ...	spit it out .
i ca n't wait for you to see . i ca n't wait ... it 's really going to be something .	well , i 'll be standing beside you the whole time , so you be sure to let me know when this whole , complete reality thing is done . would n't want to miss it .
i ... i doubt i enjoyed it any more than ... detective mills would enjoy some time alone with me in a room without windows . is n't that true ? how happy would it make you to hurt me , with impunity ?	now ... i would n't do something like that , johnny . i like you . i like you a lot .
you would n't because you know there are consequences . it 's in those eyes of yours , though ... nothing wrong with a man taking pleasure in his work . i wo n't deny my own personal desire to turn each sin against the sinner . i only took their sins to logical conclusions .	you only killed a bunch of innocent people so you could get your rocks off . that 's all .
innocent ? is that supposed to be funny ? look at the people i killed . an obese man , a disgusting man who could barely stand up ... who if you saw him on the street , you 'd point so your friends could mock him along with you . who if you saw him while you were eating , you would n't be able to finish your meal . after him i picked the lawyer . and , you both must have been secretly thanking me for that one . this was a man who dedicated his life to making money by lying with every breath he could muster ... to keeping rapists and murderers on the streets .	murderers ?
a woman ...	murderers like you ?
a woman ... so ugly on the inside that she could n't bare to go on living if she could n't be beautiful on the outside . a drug dealer ... a drug dealing pederast , actually . and , do n't forget the disease spreading whore . only in a world this shitty could you even try to say these were innocent people and keep a straight face . that 's the point . you see a deadly sin on almost every street corner , and in every home , literally . and we tolerate it . because it 's common , it seems trivial , and we tolerate , all day long , morning , noon and night . not anymore . i 'm setting the example , and it 's going to be puzzled over and studied and followed , from now on .	delusions of grandeur .
you should be thanking me .	and , why is that ?
you 're going to be remembered , and it 's all because of me . and , the only reason i 'm here right now is because i wanted to be .	we would have gotten you eventually .
tell me what it was that gave me away . what was the piece of evidence you were going to use against me right before i walked up to you and put my hands in the air .	i seem to remember knocking on your door .
and , i remember breaking your nose . you 're only alive because i did n't kill you .	sit back .
just keep leading the way .	it 's close .
i wish i could have been a normal man like you . i wish i could have a simple life .	what the fuck is going on here ? !
you 've made a good life for yourself ...	shut up !
here he comes .	what the fuck is going on ?
somerset ...	because i envy your normal life . envy is my sin .
i 'm a little thrown . i just got in town like twenty minutes ago and they dumped me here .	since we 're just starting out , i thought we could go to a bar ... sit and talk for awhile . after that , we 'll ...
i need to start getting the feel of it all , right ? meet the people .	i meant to ask you something , mills , when we spoke on the phone . i ca n't help wondering ... why here ?
i ... i do n't follow .	all this effort you 've made to get transferred , it 's the first question that pops into my head .
you just met me .	maybe i 'm not understanding the question .
it 's very simple . you worked a nice , quiet town , but you fought to get here as if your life depended on it . i 've just never seen it done that way before , detective .	maybe i thought i could do more good here than there . i do n't know . look , it 'd be great by me if we did n't start right off kicking each other in the balls . but , you 're calling the shots , lieutenant , so ... however you want it to go .
let me tell you how i want this to go . i want you to look , and i want you to listen .	i was n't standing around guarding the local taco bell . i 've worked homicide for five and a half years .
not here .	i realize that .
i wonder what exactly was the point of the conversation you were about to get into ?	and i wonder how many times officer davis there has found a dead man who was n't really dead until davis was in the car calling it in and eating a donut .
drop it .	for now .
who said this was murder ?	no one yet .
when we found him , he was lying there with a knife in his back , so what else could it be but homicide ? except , i finally figured out ... he held the knife behind him ... put the tip of it in his own back and got real close to the wall ... then he shoved his body backwards ...	please be quiet for a while , would you ?
there 's a bucket here .	what ?
it 's a bucket of vomit .	is there any blood in it ?
you think it was poison ?	guessing at this point is useless .
you 've seen my files , right ? seen the things i 've done ?	no .
anyway ... i did my time on door-to-doors , and walking a beat . i did all that shit for a long time .	good .
the badge in my pocket says `` detective , '' same as yours .	i made a decision , because i have to consider the integrity of the scene . i ca n't worry whether you think you 're getting enough time on the playing field .
is that clear ?	okay ... sure ... it 's just that , with my old partner , you know ...
same color and texture .	have you found any plastic scrapings near the stove or sink ? near the food ?
this does n't make any sense .	you always have to find one singular thing to focus on . there 's always one thing , and it may be as small as a speck of dust , but you find it and focus ... till it 's an exhausted possibility .
it could be nothing .	but , why would there be so many pieces in his stomach if it were nothing ? it must have been intentional .
he ate his fill , and was forced to continue eating ... till his body rejected the food . the killer held a bucket under him , and then kept serving . he took his time . the coroner says this might have gone on for more than twelve hours . the victim 's throat was swollen from the effort , and there was probably a point where he passed out . that 's when killer kicked him in the stomach . popped him .	this was one sadistic motherfucker .
this is his stuff . i 've been out in the cold all day .	this is a premeditated puzzle , and it 's only the beginning .
i 'm declining this case . i want us reassigned .	whoa , whoa ... what ? !
it 's too soon for him .	can we talk about this in private ?
it 's a package deal . you get the phone with the office .	detective mills here . honey ... i asked you not to call me here . i 'll call you back ... what ? why ?
it 's my wife .	what ?
well ?	i 'm invited to have a late supper at your house . and , i accept .
how 's that ?	tonight .
i 'd like you to meet somerset .	hello .
all television does is teach children that it 's really cool to be stupid and eat candy bars all day .	what about sports ?
you go to movies at least ?	i read . remember reading ?
you 've never seen `` the odd couple ? '' this is sick . `` the honeymooners ? ! ''	i vaguely recall a large , angry man , and someone called norton .
our guy got into office , probably before the building closed and security tightened up . gould must have been working late .	i 'm certain . he was the biggest defense lawyer around . infamous , actually .
the leather chair was soaked through with sweat .	all day saturday , and all day sunday . the murderer would want gould to take his time . to have to sit there and decide . where do you make the first cut ? there 's a gun in your face ... but , what part of your body is expendable ?
he must have left another puzzle piece .	look , i appreciate being able to talk this out , but , uh ...
gould 's wife . she was away on business . if this means she saw anything , i do n't know what . we 've questioned her at least five times .	and , if it 's a threat .
he 's preaching .	punishing .
the sins were used in medieval sermons . there were seven cardinal virtues , and then seven deadly sins , created as a learning tool , because they distract from true worship .	like in the parson 's tale , and dante .
did you read them ?	yeah . parts of them . anyway , in purgatory , dante and his buddy are climbing up that big mountain ... seeing all these other guys who sinned ...
seven terraces of purgation .	right . but there , pride comes first , not gluttony . the sins are in a different order .
for now , let 's just consider the books as the murderer 's inspiration . the books and sermons are about atonement for sin . and , these murders have been like forced attrition .	forced what ?
attrition . when you regret your sins , but not because you love god .	like , because someone 's holding a gun on you .
no fingerprints ?	nothing .
no witnesses of any kind ?	none . which i do n't understand . he had to get back out .
this is the one thing .	i know .
what if it 's not that she 's seen something ? what if she 's supposed to see something , but she just has n't been given a chance to see it yet ?	okay . but , what ?
you 're sure your men did n't move this ?	even if they did , those photos were taken before forensics .
nothing .	it 's got to be .
what the fuck is that ?	a switchblade .
there must be something .	we 're screwed . he 's fucking with us .
what ?	bear with me .
oh , yeah , sure . you got to be kidding ? !	just wait !
just , honestly ... have you ever seen anything like this ... been involved in anything like this ?	no .
he just may be nuts enough .	it does n't fit . he does n't want us to help him stop .
you meant what you said to mrs. gould , did n't you ? about catching this guy . you really want to believe that , do n't you ?	and you do n't ?
i wish i still thought like you .	then , you tell me what you think we 're doing .
all we do is pick up the pieces . we take all the evidence , and all the pictures and samples . we write everything down and note what time things happened ...	oh , that 's all .
we put it in a nice neat pile and file it away , on the slim chance it 's ever needed in a courtroom . it 's like collecting diamonds on a desert island . you keep them just in case you ever get rescued , but it 's a pretty big ocean out there .	bullshit .
i 'm , sorry , but even the most promising clues usually lead only to other clues . i 've seen so many corpses rolled away ... unrevenged .	i 've seen the same . i 'm not the country hick you seem to think i am .
does this make it with you ?	does n't seem like our man , does it ?
you tell me . i 'm new in town .	he does n't have the desire somehow . our killer seems to have more purpose . more purpose than victor could ever conceive of .
the fingerprints .	yes . they were there ... so , it must be .
why would we ?	satisfy our curiosity ?
never in my twenty-four years , knock on wood . i 've only ever taken my gun out five times with the actual intention of using it . never fired it though . not once . you ?	never took a bullet . i pulled my gun once . fired it once .
and ?	it was my first one of these . we were a secondary unit , and i was pretty shaky going in . i was still considered a rookie .
how did the fire fight end ?	i got him . i got the son-of-a-bitch . see , i was doing really good up till then . lots of street busts . i 've always had this weird luck ... everything always went my way , but this was wild . i got him with one shot ... right between the eyes . next thing i know , the mayor 's pinning a medal on me . picture in the paper , whole nine yards .
how was it ?	i expected it to be bad , you know . i took a human life ... but i slept like a baby that night . i never gave it a second thought .
i think hemingway wrote somewhere ... i ca n't remember where , but he wrote that in order to live in a place like this , you have to have the ability to kill . i think he meant you truly must be able to do it , not just faking it , too survive .	sounds like he knew what he was talking about .
it is victor .	call an ambulance .
the way this has gone till now , i would n't have thought it was possible , but we may have underestimated this guy .	i want him bad . i do n't just want to catch him anymore . i want to hurt him .
listen to me . he 's all about playing games .	no kidding ! no fucking kidding !
we have to divorce ourselves from emotions here . no matter how hard it is , we have to stay focused on the details .	i do n't know about you , but i feed off my emotions .
how do those cockroaches get here so quick ?	they pay cops for the inside scoop , and they pay well .
sorry about that ... i just ...	oh , it 's alright .
victor 's landlord says an envelope of cash was in the office mailbox each month . he says , quote , `` i never heard a single complaint from the tenant in apartment three-o-one , and nobody ever complained about him . he 's the best tenant i 've ever had .	a landlord 's dream tenant : a paralyzed man with no tongue .
i 'm sick of sitting around , waiting for him to kill again .	this is the job . it 's not an easter egg hunt .
there must be something in this pile of garbage we can follow . i mean , christ ... do we have to let this lunatic make all the moves .	it 's too dismissive to call him a lunatic . we ca n't make that mistake .
oh , blah , blah , blah . the guy 's insane .	it 's a fine line between insane and inspired .
hey , freud , what brand of bullshit are you shoveling , huh ? right now he 's probably dancing around his room in a pair of his mommy 's panties , singing show tunes and rubbing himself with peanut butter ...	no .
sooner or later his luck 's goning to run out .	no . he 's not depending on luck . you 've seen that . we walked into that apartment exactly one year after he first tied victor to the bed , to the day . to the day ! because he wanted us to .
we do n't know for sure ...	yes we do . here ...
this quote ... his first words to us . i looked it up . it 's from milton 's paradise lost . `` long is the way , and hard , that out of hell leads up to light ... ``	and so what ?
well , he 's been right so far , has n't he ?	just because the bastard has a library card , it does n't make him einstein .
just , realize ... this is not some common lunatic . the type of intestinal fortitude it must take ... to keep a man bound for a full year . to connect tubes to his genitals . to sever his hand and use it to plant fingerprints . he 's methodical and exacting , and worst of all , he 's patient .	what does all that matter anyway ? it 's not our job to figure him out , is it ? all we have to do is catching him .
how much money do you have ?	i do n't know ... like fifty .
well , that was money well spent .	let 's go .
by telling you this , i 'm trusting you more than i trust most people .	it 's be best if you got to the point , cause i 'm about ready to punch you in the face .
it 's probably nothing , but even if it is , it 's no skin off our teeth . the man at hot dog world is a friend , in the bureau .	him ?
for a long time , the f.b.i . 's been hooked into the library system , keeping accurate records .	what ? assessing fines ?
they monitor reading habits . not every book , but certain ones are flagged . books about ... let 's say , how to build a nuclear bomb , or maybe mein kampf . whoever takes out a flagged book has their library records fed to the f.b.i . from then on .	you got to be kidding .
flagged books cover every topic the bureau deems questionable ... communism to violent crime .	how is this legal ?
so they ran our list .	if you want to know who 's been reading paradise lost , purgatory , and say ... the life and time of charlie manson , the bureau 's computer will tell you . it might give us a name .
yeah . some college student who 's taking english 101 and just happens to be writing a paper on twentieth century crime .	yeah , well ... at least we 're out of the office . we 've got pizza .
how do you know all about this ?	i do n't . neither do you .
this is a waste of time .	we 're focusing .
i know , i know ... focusing on one little thing .	the divine comedy . a history of catholicism . a book called murderers and madmen .
modern homicide investigation . in cold blood . of human bondage . human bondage ?	it 's not what you think it is .
the marquis de sade and origins of sadism .	that is .
the writings of saint thomas aqu ... aquin ...	saint thomas aquinas . he wrote about the seven deadly sins .
you 're sure you 're reading that right ? john doe ?	that 's what it says . jonathan doe .
this is stupid . it 'd be just too easy .	we 'll take a look at him . talk to him .
what are you going to say ?	you do the talking . put that old silver tongue of yours to work .
are you alright ?	i 'm fine .
wait ... just wait .	it was him .
the hell i ca n't ! we get in there and we can stop him .	we need a warrant .
think about it ...	what the fuck is wrong with you ?
by the time we clear a warrant someone else is going to be dead .	think it through . if we leave a hole like this , we 'll never prosecute . he 'll walk . we have to come up with some excuse for knocking on this door .
you stupid son of a ...	no point in arguing anymore ...
what are you talking about ?	we had him .
we could use about fifty more men here .	i 'm trying , alright ? just tell me what we 've got .
well , there are at least five thousand notebooks in this room , and near as i can tell , each notebook contains two hundred and fifty pages .	then , he must write about these murders .
no dates indicated , placed on the shelves in no discernible order . it 's just his mind poured out on paper . i do n't think it 's going to give us any specifics .	looking around ... i 've got a bad feeling these murders are his life 's work .
he 's preaching .	these murders are his masterwork . his sermon to all of us . to all us sinners .
the irony is , after a day of the type of work he did , he 'd come home and read me these morbid crime stories . murders in the rue morgue . le fanu 's green tea . my mother would give him hell because he was keeping me up till all hours .	sounds like a father who wanted his son to follow in his footsteps .
you know ... there 's not going to be a happy ending to this . it 's not possible anymore .	if we get him , i 'll be happy enough .
no . face it now . stop thinking it 's good guys against bad guys .	how can you say that ? especially after today ?
do n't try to focus on things as black and white , because you 'll go blind . there 's no winning and losing here .	you 're the oldest man i know , somerset .
you tell me , then ... you walk into an apartment , and a man has beaten his wife to death , or the wife murdered the husband , and you have to wash the blood off their children . you put the killer in jail . who won ?	you do your job ...
where 's the victory ?	you follow the law and do the best you can . it 's all there .
just know that in this case there 's not going to be any satisfaction . if we caught john doe and he were the devil himself , if it turned out he were actually satan , then , that might live up to our expectations . no human being could do these things , right ? but , this is not the devil . it 's just a man .	why do n't you shut the fuck up for a while ? you bitch and complain ... if i thought like you , i would have slit my wrist already .
you think you 're preparing me for the hard times ahead ? you think you 're toughening me up ? well , you 're not ! you 're quitting , fine ... but i 'm staying .	people do n't want a champion . they just want to keep playing the lottery and eating hamburgers .
what the fuck is wrong with you ? what burnt you out ?	it was n't one thing , if that 's what you mean . i just ... i ca n't live here anymore . i ca n't live where stupidity is embraced and nurtured as if it were a virtue .
oh , you 're so much better than everyone , right ? no one 's worthy of you .	wrong ! i sympathize completely , because if you ca n't win ... then , if you do n't ignore everything and everyone around you , you ... you become like john doe . it 's easier to beat a child than it is to raise it , because it takes so much work to love . you just have to make sure you do n't stop to think about the abuse , and the damage , because you 'll risk being sad . keep ignoring .
you 're talking about people who are mentally ill. you 're ...	no i 'm not ! i 'm talking about common , everyday life here . if you let yourself worry about one thing , you 'll worry about the next , and the next , and it never ends . in this place , ignorance is n't just bliss , it 's a matter of survival .
listen to yourself . you say , `` the problem with people is they do n't care , so i do n't care about people . '' but , you 're already here . you 've been here a long time . so , there 's a part of you that knows , even if everything you say is true , none of it matters .	that part of me is dead .
he cut her up and dressed the wounds .	call for help , and you 'll live . but , you 'll be disfigured . or , put yourself out of your misery .
oh , you want to stay now ?	one of two things will happen . we 're either going to get john doe , or he 'll finish his series of seven , and this case will go on for years .
you think you 're doing me a big favor by staying ?	i 'm requesting you keep me on as your partner a few more days . you 'd be doing me the favor .
you knew i 'd say yes .	no , actually , i was n't sure at all .
as soon as this is over , i 'm gone .	big surprise .
because he is john doe , by choice .	when do we get to question him ?
you know he 's fucking us .	you and i are , probably for the first time ever , in total agreement . he would n't just stop .
well ... what the fuck , man ?	he 's only two murders away from finishing his masterpiece , right ? can you even conceive of what 's going to happen next ? i mean , can you even imagine how he 'll try to finish it ?
no .	i can tell you this . i recognize his lawyer . his name 's mark swarr .
if john doe 's head splits open and a u.f.o . flies out , i want you to have expected it .	i will .
what is it ?	well , i have to tell you ... i think i 've fallen in love with you .
slut .	kiss me on the lips .
stay with him .	wait !
throw your gun down now !	what are you talking about ? what happened ?
throw your weapon , detective ! now !	what did you say ?
tell me it 's not true .	i ca n't let you do this ...
put your gun down ! !	do n't do this ... please ...
i 'm sorry about this , mrs. gould . i really am .	i ... i do n't understand .
i need you to look at each one carefully ... very carefully . look for anything that seems strange or out of place . anything at all .	i do n't know why ... why now ?
anything ... anything missing or different .	i do n't see anything .
are you absolutely certain ?	i ca n't do this now ... please .
this painting ...	what ?
it 's nice to meet you . my husband has told me a lot about you ... except your first name .	oh ... um , william .
it smells good .	what ? oh , yes . i mean , thank you . please , sit down .
i hear you and mills were high school sweethearts .	high school and college , yes . pretty hokey , huh ? i knew on our first date this was the man i was going to marry . god ... he was the funniest man i 'd ever met .
do n't worry . i do n't wear it at the dinner table .	no matter how often i see guns , i still ca n't get used to them .
you have a strange way about you ... i mean interesting . i 'm sorry . it 's really none of my business . it 's just nice to meet a man who talks like that . if david saw that paper , he 'd say you 're a fag . that 's how he is .	i guess i wo n't be showing it to him then .
i was close once . it just did n't happen .	it surprises me . it really does .
how long have you lived here ?	too long . what do you think so far ?
i do n't know , with this case .	if you can , please call me . please . i have to go now ... goodnight .
i mean , you known this city . you 've been here for so long .	it 's a hard place .
i feel strange being here with you ... without david knowing .	i 'm sorry , i only ...
perfect example .	you have to put blinders on sometimes . most times .
i do n't know why i asked you to come .	talk to him about it . he 'll understand if you tell him how you feel .
i ca n't be a burden , especially now . i know i 'll get used to things . i guess i wanted to know what someone who 's lived here thinks . upstate , it was a completely different environment . i do n't know if david told you , but i teach fifth grade , or did .	he mentioned it .
i 've been going to some of the schools , looking for work , but the conditions here are ... horrible .	you should look into private schools .
oh , tracy ... i have to tell you , i 'm not the one to talk to about this .	i hate this city .
well , i got up one morning and went to work ... just like any other day , except it was my first since hearing about the baby . and , i ... i felt this fear and anxiety washing over me . i looked around , and i thought , how can we raise a child surrounded by all this ? how can a child grow up here ? so , that night , i told her i did n't want us to have it , and over the next few weeks , i convinced her it was wrong . i mean ... i wore her down , slowly .	i want to have children . it 's just ...
neighbors heard them screaming at each other for like two hours . it was nothing new . but , then they heard the gun go off . both barrels .	did the wife confess ?
why always like this ? only after the fact ... this sudden realization , that if you shoot someone , or stick a knife in them , that person will cease to exist .	crime of passion .
yes . look at all the passion splattered up on the wall here .	this is a done deal . all but the paperwork .
did their son see it happen ?	i do n't know .
how 's california ?	how should i know ?
but mose harper said ...	that old goat still creakin ' around ? ... why n't someone bury him ?
it was ethan found you squallin ' in a sage clump after your folks was massacred ...	it just happened to be me ... no need to make any more of it ...
passed the todd place comin ' in ... what happened to 'em ?	they gave up ... went back to the cotton rows ... so 'd the jamisons ... without martha , i do n't know ... she would n't let a man quit .
you askin ' me to clear out now ?	you 're my brother ... you 're welcome to stay as long as you got a mind to ... ai n't that so , martha ?
now , ethan , i ai n't sure ...	do n't argue ! ... and stay close ... maybe they 're rustlers ... and maybe this dodderin ' old idiot ai n't so far wrong ...
lucy 's going on seventeen now ...	an ' she 's got a beau ! kisses him , too !
not tonight ... ben , put that sword back .	it 's not a sword , ma ... it 's a sabre ! did you kill many damyankees with this sabre , uncle ethan ?
it 's all right , ma ... i been watchin ' ... only i wish ...	what , ben ?
killed every one -- an ' not for food either ... why 'd they do a thing like that ?	stealing the cattle was just to pull us out ... this here 's a murder raid ... it shapes up to scald out either your place ... or my brother 's .
let 's get along ...	why do n't you finish the job ?
they got to stop < u > sometime < /u > ... if they 're human at all , they got to stop !	naw ... a human man rides a horse till it dies ... then he goes on afoot ... a comanche comes along ... gets that horse up ... and rides it twenty more miles ... then he eats it .
you 've said that enough ! ... maybe lucy 's dead ... maybe they 're both dead ... but if i hear it from you again , i 'll fight ya , mr. edwards !	that 'll be the day ! ... let 's ride .
why 'd they break off ? was there water in that canyon ?	huh ... ? no ... no water .
what you saw was n't lucy .	it was , i tell you !
< u > charlie < /u > < u > maccorry < /u > ! ... you were n't fixin ' to marry him ? ?	she sure is ! ... an ' do n't think your comin ' back is goin ' to change it !
as to that , i do n't know , charlie ... we had n't got around to talkin ' marriage ...	what right you got to be talkin ' marriage to any decent woman ...
if you 're talkin ' about that crazy murder charge ...	and other things ... mebbe you thought you was gettin ' away with being comical about that indian wife you took ... i bet she was n't the first squaw you ...
it 's all right ... charlie , let 's move outside .	i ai n't wearing no gun .
another one , eh ?	this 'un come a long way 'fore he died .
is this in the line of duty , sergeant ?	no sir ... pleasure .
you all right , sergeant ?	dunno ... seems so .
you 're goin ' if the captain says you 're goin ' ...	now , now ... let 's not grow dis- putatious ...
ethan , you an ' martin are hereby appointed civilian scouts -- without pay ... charlie , hightail it to head- quarters an ' spread the word ...	yes sir ...
have n't seen you since the surrender . come to think of it , i did n't see you < u > at < /u > the surrender .	i do n't believe in surrenderin ' ... i still got my sabre , reverend ... never turned it into any ploughshare neither !
you ai n't goin ' ...	he sure < u > is < /u > goin ' ... he 's sworn in .
you can forget that ... would n't be legal anyway .	why ? you wanted for a crime , ethan ?
you askin ' as a reverend or a captain , sam ?	i 'm askin ' as a ranger of the sovereign state of texas .
got a warrant ?	you fit a lot of descriptions .
he cometh forth like a ...	amen ! ... put an 'amen ' to it !
what good does that do ?	by what you preach ... none !
they 're camped by the river -- 'bout twenty miles from here . soon 's it gets dark we 'll circle out so 's to jump 'em before day- break .	you 're right sure you want to < u > jump < /u > 'em , ethan ?
it 's what we 're here for , ai n't it ?	i thought we were trying to get the girls back -- < u > alive < /u > ... we jump those comanches , they 'll kill 'em ... you know that !
what do you know about it ? ... what 's a quarter-breed cherokee know about the comanche trick of sleeping with his best pony tied right beside him ... you got as much chance of stampedin ' their herd as ...	... as you have of findin ' those girls alive by ridin ' into 'em ... i say we do it my way , ethan ... and that 's an order !
you got any more orders , captain ?	just keep goin ' ...
if you were tryin ' to surround 'em , you sure succeeded .	how far 's the river from here , mose ?
i did n't give any order to fire !	that 's all right , captain ... i do n't need any formal invitation to kill a comanch ...
evenin ' ... evenin ' reverend ... or do i call you 'captain ' ... ?	came here for a wedding , ethan ... until that 's over , i reckon 'reverend ' will do ...
fight fair , son ... use your fists !	comanches do n't use their fists , reverend ... let 'em alone ...
i got to ask you and martin to ride to the state capitol with me , ethan .	this an invite to a necktie party , reverend ?
we can get within 500 yards ... there 's a hogback to the south .	how many , would you say ?
now son , it 's a bitter thing to say , but there 's more than your sister at stake here .	there sure is ! i 'm going to tell you somethin ' ... i was n't going to speak of it ... but i 'll tell you now . did you notice them scalps strung on scar 's lance ? did you see the third scalp from the point of the lance ? long ... wavy hair ...
i did n't < u > want < /u > to tell you ... but maybe it 's your right to know .	now mount up , son ...
i say no !	go ahead , son ... but at the first alarm , we 're comin ' in -- and we ai n't goin ' to have time to pick and choose our targets when we do ...
what in ... ?	captain clayton ... captain !
go on ! why n't you have your bugler sound the charge while you 're at it ? ?	sir ?
never mind ... your pa know you 're out here ?	yes , sir ... troop 's about ten miles back ... the colonel sent me looking for you ...
if there 's anything i can do , sir ...	god forbid ... no , son , you flog on back and tell your pa where we 're at ... and where he 's at ...
but he knows that , sir ... ca n't i stay , sir ?	all right ... but keep your eye on me , boy ... i 'm the hard case you 're up against here -- not these childish savages ... if you do n't hear me first time i holler , you better read my mind ... i do n't aim to raise no two hollers on any subject at hand ...
is captain clayton here , reverend ?	i 'm clayton .
colonel greenhill 's compliments , sir . the colonel wishes to know how soon you could put a company of rangers in the field , fully armed and ...	hold on , son ... who 's this colonel greenhill you 're talking about ?
why colonel greenhill is colonel greenhill , sir ... commanding officer , fifth u.s. cavalry ... i 'm lieutenant greenhill , sir .	oh ... now what 's this your pa wants to know ?
my pa wants to know ... < u > colonel < /u > < u > greenhill < /u > wants to know how soon you could put a company of your rangers in the field , fully armed and equipped , for joint punitive action against the comanches .	joint action ?
and what makes you think he 's in this territory ?	yesterday , one of our patrols picked up a man claims he was a prisoner with scar till only two days ago ... he talks crazy but i brought him along ... says he lives here ... keeps mentioning a rocking chair .
you tell your pa a company of rangers -- all fourteen of 'em -- fully armed an ' equipped will be in the field by daylight ... headin ' for the south end of the malapai . if he can catch up with us , well an ' good ...	but ... but captain , we ca n't possibly take the field tomorrow ... for your own protection ...
martin ! ride me as far as the well !	grab hold ! ...
unnt-meah !	we ai n't goin ' ! we ai n't goin ' without you , debbie ... ethan , get the horses ... i 'll try to keep her talkin ' ...
i do n't care what they 've done to you ... what happened ...	they have done ... nothing ... they are my people ...
no debbie ! that ai n't what happened ! they been lyin ' to you ...	you lie ! all white men lie ... and kill ...
debbie , think back ! i 'm martin ... remember ? remember how i used to let you ride my horse ? tell you stories ? do n't you remember me , debbie ?	i remember ... from always ... at first i prayed to you ... come and get me ... take me home ... you did n't come ...
i 've come now ...	these are my people ... unnt-meah ! go ! go ! < u > please < /u > !
ay-eh ... they was here ...	sure ! ... they < u > were < /u > here ... now they 're out there ... an ' waitin ' to jump us ! ...
steady , daniel boone ! you do n't want to miss ... it makes them think their medicine 's stronger than yours ...	ay-eh ... that 's jest what i tole joe powers ... that un 's gettin ' kinda sassy , ai n't he , ethan ?
leggo my arm ... you look mangier 'n ever .	ai n't been too good ... no sir , not too good ... gettin ' old , ethan ...
well , the reward still stands ...	do n't want no money , ethan ... jus ' a place -- a roof over m ' head ... a little grub ... a bunk to sleep in ... an ' a rockin ' chair by the fire ... my own rockin ' chair by a fire ...
you help me find her , you got your rockin ' chair ...	swear it , ethan ? ... given word ?
told ya , did n't i ?	ethan ... i found a man 's seen her ... knows where little debbie is !
come f'r my rockin ' chai ' ... ole mose .	where 's scar , mose ... scar ?
mose ... try to remember ! ... you were in scar 's camp ...	ay-eh ... made out i was crazy ... ate dirt ... chewed grass ... i fooled 'em , ethan ! ... an ' i got away ...
scar ! where 's he holed in ?	seven fingers ... ay-eh ... seven ...
how 'd you come by this ?	you said there 'd be a thousand dollar reward .
that 's what i said .	you got it with you ?
talk !	a young buck fetched it in late last summer ... said it belonged to a captive chile of chief scar ...
scar ? never heard of any chief scar .	me neither ... but this buck claimed he was a big war chief with the nawyecky comanches .
keep talking .	scar 's band was headin ' north ... to winter in at fort wingate ... eatin ' agency beef . that 's what this buck said ... maybe he lied .
and maybe you lie ...	in that case you wo n't find her -- and i wo n't get my thousand dollars .
do n't forget to come back with my thousand dollars .	ai n't yours yet .
sir -- we charged ! ..gentlemen -- and i hope you will quote me -- i can not say too much for the courage of the men who followed me into that cheyenne camp ...	< u > cheyenne < /u > ! what cheyenne ?
i beg your pardon ?	that camp you hit was nawyecka comanche ... chief scar 's bunch ...
my name 's edwards ... i 'm looking for my niece ... she was in that camp when you attacked ...	well ... i know there were some captives recovered ...
are you sure they did n't die of carbine shots fired by a bunch o ' yank bluebellies so scared they could n't tell the difference between a cheyenne and a comanche ?	keefer ! ..put this man under arrest !
not quite ... quarter cherokee . the rest is welsh ... so they tell me .	you 've done a lot of growin ' ...
somethin ' mighty fishy about this trail , uncle ethan ...	stop callin ' me 'uncle ' ... i ai n't your uncle .
yes , sir .	do n't have to call me 'sir ' neither ... nor grampaw neither ... nor methuselah neither ... i can whup you to a frazzle .
what you want me to call you ?	name 's ethan ... now what 's so mighty fishy about this trail ?
well , come on !	easy ! it 's forty miles , sonny ... horses can do with some grain and a little rest .
nothing for you to see .	leggo ...
all right ... but i 'm givin ' the orders ... you take 'em or we split up here and now ...	why , sure , ethan ... there 's just the one thing we 're after ... finding deborah and lucy ...
easy on that !	sorry ... we do n't even know if debbie 'n lucy are with this bunch ... maybe they split up ...
you want us to fire a shot if ...	no ... nor build bonfires ... nor beat drums neither . i 'll meet you on the far side .
you all right , ethan ?	huh ... ? sure i 'm all right ...
say ! ... what happened to your blanket ? lose it ?	must 've ... anyway , i ai n't goin ' back to look for it ...
what you goin ' to do ?	get some sleep ... tomorrow 's another day ...
say it . we 're beat !	no ... our turnin ' back do n't change anything ... not in the long run . if she 's alive , she 's safe ... for a while ... they 'll keep her to raise as one of their own , 'til she 's of an age to ...
and you think we got a chance to find her ?	an injun will chase a thing til he thinks he 's chased it enough ... then he quits ... same when he runs ... seems he never learns there 's such a thing as a critter that might just keep comin ' on ... so we 'll find them in the end , i promise you that ... we 'll find them just as sure as the turning of the earth .
good night ... laurie ...	good night ...
jorgensen 's been runnin ' his cattle with my own ...	your cattle ? ... < u > debbie 's < /u > cattle !
he 's agreed to take you on and share the increase from my herd while i 'm gone ... i 'll be pushin ' on tomorrow ...	i ai n't stayin ' ... i set out lookin ' for debbie ... i aim to keep on ...
why ?	because she 's my ... my ...
she 's your nothin ' ... she 's no kin to you at all !	i always felt like she was ... her folks takin ' me in , raisin ' me like one of their own ...
that do n't make 'em kin ...	all right ... i ai n't got no kin ... i 'm goin ' to keep lookin ' that 's all .
martin ... i want you to know some- thin ' ...	yeah ... you want me to know i ai n't got no kin -- no money -- no horses -- nothing but a dead man 's clothes to wear ! ..you tole me that already ... now shut your head !
hey ! what 's the idea ... ?	maybe i 'm gettin ' like mose harper -- my bones is cold tonight ...
not so funny ... if you recollect what 'nawyecka ' means ...	what 's that ?
sorta like 'roundabout ' -- like a man says he 's goin ' one place when he means to go just the reverse ...	oh ...
futterman ?	he just could n't wait ...
let 's go ... i think i stumbled onto somethin ' ...	scar ?
when are you goin ' to learn to keep your mouth shut ! come on . let 's get out of here .	but i just bought a good blanket .
what i heard back there was that a band o ' hostile nawyeckas came through this way less'n two weeks ago ...	think it might be ... ?
< u > you < /u > do n't understand , ya chunkhead ! < u > you < /u > did n't buy any blanket ! ya bought < u > her < /u > !	what ?
you got yourself a < u > wife < /u > , sonny !	oh no ! tell her she 's got to go back ...
that 's the way to train 'em . looks like mrs. pauley 's goin ' to make you a fine beautiful wife ...	cut it out , will ya ...
says her name 's wild goose flying in the night sky ... but she 'll answer to look since it pleases ya ...	look ?
you ask her !	look ! scar ? ... do you know where he went ? and if he has a girl with him ... a < u > white < /u > girl -- nai-bist pabo taibo ...
beats me how she could get that pony out o ' camp without neither of us hearin ' a thing ...	she ai n't goin ' back to her family , that 's certain ... not if she took off where the arrow points .
think she means for us to follow ?	how should < u > i < /u > know ... she 's your wife !
i think maybe we oughta ...	yeah , i kinda figgered you 'd say that ... bein ' a new husband and all ...
ethan , quit it !	nine ... ten !
least , < u > they < /u > wo n't feed any comanches this winter ... killin ' buffalo 's as good as killin ' injuns in this country .	peaceful tribes depend on the buffalo , too ... .
well , you 're a widower now ...	what 'd the soldiers have to kill her for ! ..
no ... she 's not ...	i ai n't sure ... where 's that doll ?
lem me alone ...	you breeds are all alike -- two drinks an ' ...
suit yourself ... while you 're enjoyin ' your little conversation , i 'll be ridin ' out with senor fernandez here ... the comanch ' medicine country ai n't far ... there 's one camp with a chief named cicatriz .	never heard of him ...
stay out here .	not likely .
you figger scar means to kill us ?	he 's got to ... all these years , run- nin ' , dodgin ' , knowin ' we were after him ... now we caught up ... it 's him or us .
why did n't he make his move back there ?	i do n't know ... somethin ' tied his hands ... maybe hospitality ...
how ? she 's even forgot her own language !	debbie , you 're comin ' with us ! hear me ?
go on ! get out of here while you can ...	over there !
they 'll be back ...	we wo n't be here ... come on !
'i , ethan edwards , being of sound mind and without any blood kin , do hereby bequeath all my property of any kind to martin pauley ... ' i do n't want your property ... . 'sides , what do you mean no 'blood kin ? ' debbie 's your blood kin ...	not no more .
you can keep your will ! i ai n't forgettin ' you was all set to shoot her yourself ... what kind o ' man are you , anyway .	she 's been with the bucks ! she 's nothin ' now but a ...
what 's that got to do with us ?	what 's goin ' on ?
wait ! we go chargin ' in , they 'll kill her ... and you know it .	it 's what i 'm countin ' on .
i know you are ... only it ai n't goin ' to be that way ... she 's alive ...	livin ' with comanches ai n't bein ' alive ...
i saw it ... and do n't try to tell me it was aunt martha 's or lucy 's ...	you do n't remember it , but i remember . that was your mother 's scalp !
was your niece about their age ?	not far from it ...
hard to realize they 're white , is n't it ...	they 're not white any more -- they 're < u > comanche < /u > ! ... let 's see the bodies ...
well , we only got the one lead -- scar ... and where we begin to look , i do n't know ...	there 's one thing . we recovered a bushel of trinkets in that camp ... cheap stuff ... trade goods ... could n't help noticing that most of it was mexican ... maybe if you could talk to some of those mexican traders along the border ... what do they call themselves ?
comancheros ...	that 's the breed ... course it might take time .
i 'd be obliged if you 'd get to the point , ma'am .	i am ... i am ... it 's just that i know martha 'd want you to think of her boys as well as her girls ... and if the girls are ... dead ... ethan , do n't let the boys waste their lives in vengeance !
well , you did all a body could , ethan .	i got your boy killed .
why it 's just a snip of calico ...	you ever see it before ... like mebbe on a dress debbie wore ?
yes ! ..yes , i remember ! ..have they found her , ethan ?	no ... not yet ...
she 's not a little girl any more .	you 've seen her ! ... she 's alive ?
oh , all right ! well ... martin says ...	from the beginning ...
'dear miss laury ' ... he spells it with a y instead of an i ... e ... would n't you think he 'd know ...	who cares what he spells it ? read the letter .
the < u > late < /u > mister futterman ?	that means mister futterman is dead , by golly .
every young man should at least once ... go on , laurie ! read !	a little comanche squaw - squaw !
they never find that girl .	yours truly ... and he even has to write his full name ... martin pauley ... not even just < u > martie < /u > ! ... i do n't care if he < u > never < /u > comes back !
do n't go takin ' that stuff ...	ai n't worth the mendin ' ...
what you gettin ' red-in-the-face for ? ... i have brothers , have n't i ?	well i ai n't one of 'em !
i 'm a woman , martie ... we wash and mend your dirty clothes all our lives ... when you 're little we even wash < u > you < /u > ... .how a man can ever make out to get bashful in front of a woman i 'll never know ...	you talk like a feller might just as leave run around nekkid ...
might at least have left me my pants !	shush ! ... time for bed anyway ... likely these 'll need some takin ' in ... oh , martie , you 're that gaunted ! ... ma 's havin ' a turkey for dinner tomorrow and ...
futterman ! ... he 's got a little tradin ' post on the south fork o ' the brazos ... laurie , i just got to get me a good horse ! think yer pa would ...	finish your breakfast ...
i got ta catch up with him , laurie !	go on then ! pa 's in the barn saddlin ' the fort worth stud ... an ' you can take the light gelding with the blaze ...
take it and welcome ... but do n't count on finding me here when you get back ... i 've been dallying around this god-forsaken wind-scour almost two long years waitin ' for you ... i ai n't cut out to be an old maid !	i ca n't help it , laurie ... i just got ta catch up with ethan ...
i ... i wrote you a letter ... reckon you did n't get it ...	one letter in five years ... i read it till the paper dried up and the writing faded out ...
it was n't much of a letter ...	no , it was n't ... you mighta said you loved me ... you mighta asked me to wait ... at least that 'd have been something ...
but i allus loved you ... you know that , without my sayin ' it ... i could n't bring myself to ask you to wait ... the little i had ... not knowin ' how much longer until we found debbie ...	it is n't fair ...
do n't cry , laurie ... i understand how it is ... i 'll just go 'way ...	you do and i 'll die , martie ... i will ! i 'll just die !
martie ... do n't go ! not this time .	you crazy ?
it 's too late ... she 's a woman grown now ...	i got to fetch her home ...
fetch < u > what < /u > home ? ... the leavin 's of comanche bucks -- sold time an ' again to the highest bidder ? ... with savage brats of her own , most like ? ...	< u > laurie < /u > ! shut your mouth !
do you know what ethan will do if he has a chance ? ... he 'll put a bullet in her brain ! and i tell you martha would want him to !	only if i 'm dead !
she 'd be about thirteen now ...	we got two around that age ...
where ?	you 'll have to wait until we reach the agency ... fall in behind the column ...
but could n't you ... ?	sorry ... keep the column moving ! ..close ranks there !
why else ?	come on , say it . you know ...
say it anyway . come on , how much do you love me ?	`` with you , my life began and with you shall it end ... ''
i have to cut his windpipe ...	you 're not a doctor , you 'll hurt him !
ellen , move aside ...	oh god , tommi ...
stop that !	you 'll never get away from me !
so , how does it feel to be kissed by two women ?	they say it 's fantastic . at least that 's what i read in a men 's magazine . so who are the two lucky ones ?
oh , the muse ... we 're still having our differences . you know how it is with women .	well then , i guess i 'd better leave the two of you alone . but do n't forget ...
what kind of a horrible thing is that ?	it still worked in town .
i mean the armchair !	oh , that was upstairs . a real antiquity ! i think it 's great .
maybe the antenna 's broken .	we 're probably lucky that we even have running water and electricity ! damned box !
hey ... the fuse .	oh , damnit !
do you know where fuse box is ?	in the cellar , i think . wait , i 'll take care of it .
look at this ! we 'll have to fix the whole wiring . this stuff is dangerous as hell .	we 'll call for someone from town first thing in the morning .
are you crazy ? that costs a fortune !	do you have a better idea ?
i 'll do it myself .	you ?
my father was an electrician . already forgot that ?	my father was a pilot . and do i know how to fly ?
hey , flower child , the sixties are over . and this stuff is hazardous to your health .	yes , daddy .
where are you going ?	well , if you wo n't let me smoke grass , then at least i 'll go get myself some cigarettes .
what are you doing ?	making our very own solstice fire .
is everything alright ? are n't you feeling well ?	i just had a really strange experience .
maybe i should talk to dr. roth about it .	hey , take your time . you know time heals better than any shrink ever can .
i have a funny feeling . do you think we 'll get over all that 's happened ?	we just have to make a new beginning .
cherry-red tears .	what ?
cherry-red tears , your first book . i read it at least nine times . and then i found out you were going to attend some kind of book fair .	not a book fair . i was signing autographs in a department store .
i was so excited about meeting you . again and again , i kept getting in the back of the line so i could be the last to talk to you .	and two months later , we got married . and all because of one sentence : `` with you , my life began and with you shall it end ... ''
i miss tommi so much .	so do i , believe me .
do you really think anything can ever be like it was before ?	maybe different . i do n't know , ellen .
who was that ?	someone from the village .
martin , it 's not funny !	you know , it 's not always easy for me , either . but at least i try not to give in to each and every neurosis .
well , apparently it was a big mistake to try talking to you . do n't you remember what we promised to each other ? honesty - trust !	come on , this is n't about honesty . you just need a good night 's sleep . the way you toss and turn all night , even i hardly get any sleep .
now , what did i do to deserve this ?	come on , at least try one . it took me two hours to make these .
so , did you sleep good ?	yeah ... i have to go to town .
hey , you 're still here . i suppose you like it here with us .	no , thanks . i have everything i need . drive safely , you hear ?
do n't tell me you 've made friends with that wandering flea circus ?	why not ? she can guard the house . by the way , i gave her a name : clara .
where have you been all day ?	i went to see prof. roth ! you know , i had another one of those dreams last night . i saw tommi !
but that 's not the point ! what if all these things are somehow connected ?	oh , baloney . you should just hear yourself talk !
where have you been ?	in the village . look what i found .
`` events commonly interpreted as haunting apparitions often result from psychic disharmonies or undigested traumatic ordeals ... ''	ellen , what are you trying to prove , anyway ? that we 've created ourselves a ghost ? come on !
it 's just a feeling . do n't you sense it , too ?	what ? what am i supposed to sense ?
who 's that ?	i have n't the slightest idea .
what ?	look at this ! the dog ! she 's dead !
she was old .	old ? ! come look at this ! she has wounds . wounds on her head . like thrashes . or bites .
maybe an animal .	an animal ? what kind of animal ? a goddamned t-rex , or what ?
let me guess : another short circuit ?	hi , darling .
during the middle ages people were executed at every corner . what 's your point ?	this house , the whole damned area around here is one mass grave ... now you might call me crazy , but there is something negative about the place .
will you finally cut it out ? just in case you have n't noticed , i am trying to write a book here . and maybe - even with your birdbrains - you can figure it 's a pretty tough job . so why ca n't you just leave me alone ?	damn it , look at you ! do n't you see what 's happening with you ? we need to get out of here , do n't you understand ? out of this house !
martin , what-	it 's simply too dangerous here ! but no , you always have to have it your way .
you know what i have to do now , and believe me : i do n't enjoy doing this .	martin , damnit , what are you up to ? let go of me !
of course you 'll give me the blame again . like back then . just a tiny cut and he could still be alive today - is n't that right , ellen ?	what are you talking about-
oh , ellen . my sweet ellen ... of course i knew .	we loved each other once . have you forgotten that ?
i told you , there is no way out . he wo n't let you go .	'he ' ? whom do you mean-
it 's important - he knows the last chapter .	your book - that 's why you were always in the cellar !
you know , tommi wants me to become the man i used to be .	... so he 's dictating you a new bestseller ? whatever that is , it 's not our son .
what ?	i have a yearning for ... smog , cars and many , many people ... a real dirty ... big city . what do you think ?
how did you get me out of there ?	i would n't have made it by myself .
for god 's sake , what happened to me ?	you do n't remember ?
ellen .	you 're doing fine , are n't you ? i mean ... the two of you alone in that house , so far out in the moor .
oh , ellen ! i 've been wondering when you 'd come . why do n't you step in .	thank you .
i really hate to bother him , but ...	oh no , no . you 're not bothering him . he has lots of time since he 's been retired .
frank kosinski . here 's the address . go see him . ask him .	thank you . elisabeth , i did n't mean to ...
that 's alright . do n't misunderstand my husband . it 's only that he 's already had enough problems with this case . and who would believe him if he told the truth ?	but what is the truth ?
hello . can i help you ?	does this dog here belong to you ?
no , i 've never seen him before .	you know , i saw him sitting outside your gate ... oh , i 'm sorry , i 'm forgetting my manners again ! i have n't even introduced myself yet . hi , my name 's lindner . karl lindner .
ellen straub .	it 's a pleasure . you 're from the city , right ?
do i look like it that much ?	village gossip . you 're a real attraction here .
i guess it 's too lonely for most folks . it 's time for me to get going . it 's been a pleasure meeting you .	wait , wo n't you join me for a cup of coffee ?
you know , after doing that job for so many years , you learn to appreciate the simple things in life . flowers incorporate a beauty that i always missed in life . but certainly , you 're not here to chat about my hobbies .	1976. what happened back then ?
do yourself a favor : do n't ask .	i appreciate your concern , but we live in that house . i need to know what happened in there .
listen , it 's one thing to have a guilt complex . but i know the difference between when i 'm overstrung and when i 'm seeing things that are simply not there ! besides , it only began after we moved !	there is , of course , another possible explanation which i dearly hope is not the case .
and that is ?	a tumor - which could cause pressure on certain parts of the brain and , thus , influence your perception .
mrs. straub !	i 've killed my husband !
what ?	i think i 've killed him . martin , my husband , i 've killed him ! that is , i 'm not sure , but ...
it all went so fast . he was out of his mind and then all of sudden there was this screwdriver . i only wanted to defend myself . you have to call the police ...	we can do all of that later , but first you need to calm down .
oh , mrs. straub . may i introduce you to my wife ?	just call me elisabeth .
stop scaring people . let 's go . we need to be on our way .	excuse us . but do stop by for a visit sometime ! you are welcome anytime .
you did n't tell her !	we should leave the past alone .
i think it 's starting again . you know ... there was something peculiar . if only i knew ...	peculiar ? you mean , like back then ?
hammer ?	how could i fail to notice that ! - i have to go ...
well , look here !	ladies and gentlemen : the `` straub country-residence '' .
damn , this thing is heavy . where do you want to have it ?	tenth floor .
look at this . the lock is totally demolished .	i guess someone lost their key . you did get your tetanus shots , i hope ?
twenty-three , to be exact .	i wonder how you guys figure on renovating this whole place . you can afford to spend some money . if i was you , i 'd spare myself all the hard work . besides , did n't you want to start writing again ?
hey , my man ! how 's the masterpiece coming along ?	not so bad , if i could get some peace and quiet around here .
we are in desperate want of a mercutio , ned , a young nobleman of verona	and the title of this piece ?
willwhere is mercutio ?	locked safe in here . i leave the scene in your safe keeping , ned , i have a sonnet to write .
you did not like the speech ?	the speech is excellent . `` oh , then i see queen mab hath been with you ! '' excellent and a good length . but then he disappears for the length of a bible .
nedi knowi know	it 's good .
oh	the title wo n't do .
ah	romeo and juliet -- just a suggestion .
you are a gentleman .	and you are a warwickshire shit-house .
ohwhat have i done ?	he was the first man among us . a great light has gone out .
follow that boat !	right you are , governor !
i know your face . are you an actor ?	yes .
yes , i 've seen you in something . that one about a king .	really ?
do you know that house ?	sir robert de lesseps .
oh , thomas ! she has cut my strings ! i am unmanned , unmended , and unmade , like a puppet in a box .	writer , is he ?
thank you , my lady !	lady ?
what do you want , kit ?	my massacre at paris is complete .
you have the last act ?	you have the money ?
tomorrow .	then tomorrow you will have the pages .
wait ! will you desist !	twenty pounds on delivery
what is money to me like us ? besides , if i need a play , i have another waiting , a comedy by shakespeare .	romeo ? -- he gave it to henslowe .
never !	well , i am to deptford now , i leave my respects , miss rosaline .
i gave shakespeare two sovereigns for romeo !	you did . but ned alleyn and the admiral 's men have the playing of it as the rose .
burbage , i will see you hanged for a pickpocket .	the queen has commanded , she loves a comedy and the master of the revels favours us .
and what favour does mr. tilney receive from you ?	ask him .
we have no juliet !	no juliet ? !
we will all be put in the clink .	see you in jail .
there is no dog in the first scene , will kempe , thank you . how goes it will ?	i am still owed money for this play , burbage .
not from me . i only stole it . when are you coming over to the chamberlain 's men ?	when i have fifty pounds .
are you writing ?	a comedy . all but done , a pirate comedy , wonderful .
what is the chief part ?	romeo . wit , swordsman , lover .
the title ?	romeo
i will play him . bring it tomorrow .	it 's for henslowe . he paid me .
how much ?	ten pounds .
i swear it . he wants romeo for ned and the admiral 's men .	ned is wrong for it .
here is two sovereigns -- i 'll give you two more when you show me the pages .	done .
words , words , wordsonce , i had the gifti could make love out of words as a potter makes cups out of clay love that overthrows empires , love that binds two hearts together come hellfire and brimstonesfor sixpence a line , i could cause a riot in a nunnerybut now	and yet you tell me you lie with women ?
black sue , fat phoebe , rosaline , burbage 's seamstress ; aphrodite , who does it behind the dog and	aye , now and again , but what of it ? i have lost my gift .
i am here to help you . tell me in your own words .	i have lost my gift . it 's as if my quill is broken . as if the organ of the imagination has dried up . as if the proud tower of my genius has collapsed .
interesting .	nothing comes .
most interesting .	it is like trying to a pick a lock with a wet herring .
how long has it been ?	a goodly length in times past , but lately
a woman of property ?	she had a cottage . one day , she was three months gone with child , so
and your relations ?	on my mother 's side the ardens
no , your marriage bed .	four years and a hundred miles away in stratford . a cold bed too , since the twins were born . banishment was a blessing .
so now you are free to love	yet can not love nor write it .
will it restore my gift ?	the woman who wears the snake will dream of you , and your gift will return . words will flow like a river . i will see you in a week .
gentlemen ! thank you ! you are welcome .	who is that ?
i saw his tamburlaine , you know . wonderful .	yes , i saw it .
mr. fennyman , because you love the theatre you must have a part in my play . i am writing an apothecary , a small but vital role .	by heaven , i thank you ! i will be your apothecary !
i have not said all . by malign fate , the message goes astray which would tell romeo of the friar 's plan . he hears only that juliet is dead . and thus he goes to the apothecary .	that 's me .
when ?	two weeks , three at the most , aaaagh ! for pity 's sake .
i have a wonderful new play !	put his feet in .
it 's a comedy .	cut his nose off .
a new comedy . by will shakespeare !	and his ears .
and a share . we will be partners , mr. fennyman !	partners !
what 's the title ?	romeo and ethel the pirate 's daughter .
but i have to pay the actors and the authors .	a share of the profits .
there 's never any	of course not !
romeo and ethel the pirate 's daughteralmost finished ?	without doubt he is completing it at this very moment .
this time we take your boots off !	what have i done , mr. fennyman ?
the theatres are all closed by the plague !	oh , that .
by order of the master of the revels !	mr. fennyman , let me explain about the theatre business . the natural condition is one of insurmountable obstacles on the road to imminent disaster . believe me , to be close by the plague is a bagatelle in the ups and downs of owning a theatre .
so what do we do ?	nothing . strangely enough , it all turns out well .
how ?	i do n't know . it 's a mystery .
where is the play ?	oh , it 's coming , it 's coming .
is it going well ?	very well .
but nothing is happening .	yes , but very well .
i want no more trouble , mr. fennyman . as i explained to you , the theatre business	henslowe , you pound of tripe , in my business i would be out of business if i had your courage , so do n't tell me about business
mr. shakespeare has given me the part of the apothecary !	the apothecary ? will , what is the story ? where is the shipwreck ? how does the comedy end ?
well , that will have them rolling in the aisles .	sad and wonderful ! i have a blue velvet cap which will do well , i have seen apothecary with a cap just so .
ned , i swear i knew nothing of this !	nobody knew !
it is over .	i am so sorry , mr. henslowe . i wanted to be an actor . i am sorry , will .
no juliet ? !	it will be all right , madam .
what happened to sam ?	who are you ?
do you know it ?	every word .
will ! where is my play ? tell me you have it nearly done ! tell me you have it started . you have begun ?	doubt that the stars are fire , doubt that the sun doth move
no , no , we have n't the time . talk prose . where is my play ?	it is all locked safe in here
god be praised ! locked ?	as soon as i have found my muse
who is she this time ? !	she is always aphrodite .
aphrodite baggot who does it behind the dog and trumpet ?	henslowe , you have no soul so how can you understand the emptiness that seeks a soulmate ?
well , i am a dead man and buggered to boot . my theatre is close by the plague these twelve weeks , my company is playing the inn-yards of england , while burbage and the chamberlain 's men are invited to court and receive ten pounds to play your piece , written for my theatre , by my writer , at my risk when you were green and grateful -	what piece ? richard crookback ?
no -- it 's comedy they want , will ! comedy ! like romeo and ethel ?	who wrote that ?
nobody ! you are writing it for me ! i gave you three pounds a month since .	half what you owed me . i am still due for one gentleman of verona .
mr. henslowe , will you lend me fifty pounds ?	fifty pounds ? what for ?
burbage offers me a partnership in the chamberlain 's men . for fifty pounds my hired player days are over .	cut out my heart ! throw my liver to the dogs !
where are you going ?	to my weekly confession .
now where ? will ?	to the palace at whitehall .
i feel a scene coming on .	is it about a pirate 's daughter ?
romeo and rosaline . scene one ! god , i 'm good !	rosaline ? you mean ethel .
will ! have you finished ?	yes . nearly . it 's all locked safe in here . we need ralph for the pirate king . good morning , master nol . you will have a nice little part .
my tailor . wants to be an actor . i have a few debts here and there . well , that seems to be everybody . did you see a romeo ?	i did not .
well , i to my work , you to yours . when can i see pages ?	tomorrow
we are at least six men short , and those we have will be overparted , ranters and stutterers who should be sent back to the stews . my romeo has let me down . i see disaster .	we are at least four acts short , will , if you are looking for disaster .
nobody . the author .	we are about to embark on a great voyage .
it is customary to make a little speech on the first day . it does no harm and authors like it .	you want to know what parts you are to receive . all will be settled as we go
cut round him for now .	what ? who ?
romeo .	the one who came with your letter ?
juliet ? you mean ethel .	god 's teeth , am i to suffer this constant stream of interruption ? ! what will you do in act two when he meets the love of his life ?
by god , i wish i knew .	by god , will , if you do not , who does ? let us have pirates , clowns , and a happy ending , or we will send you back to stratford to your wife !
we are lost .	no , it will turn out well .
how will it ?	i do n't know , it 's a mystery .
another little problem .	what do we do now ?
the show must you know	go on .
juliet does not come on for twenty pages . it will be all right .	how will it ?
kit	how goes it , will ?
wonderful , wonderful .	burbage says you have a play .
i insist -- and a beaker for mr. marlowe . the barman does the business .	i hear you have a new play for the curtain .
not new -- my doctor faustus .	i love your early work . `` was this the face that launched a thousand ships and burnt the topless towers of ilium ? ''
i have a new one nearly done , and better . the massacre at paris .	good title .
and yours ?	romeo and ethel the pirate 's daughter . yes , i know .
what is the story ?	well , there 's a pirate in truth , i have not written a word .
romeo isitalian . always in and out of love .	yes , that 's good . until he meets
ethel .	do you think ?
the daughter of his enemy .	the daughter of his enemy .
his best friend is killed in a duel by ethel 's brother or something . his name is mercutio .	mercutiogood name .
good luck with yours , kit .	i thought your play was for burbage .
this is a different one .	a different one you have n't written ?
`` good morrow , cousin . ''	`` is the day so young ? ''
`` but new struck nine . ''	`` ay me , sad hours seem long . was that my father that went hence so fast ? ''
it was . what sadness lengthens romeo 's hours ? ''	`` not having that which , having , makes them short . ''
`` out . ''	`` of love ? ''
two hours at prayer !	lady viola is pious , my lord .
piety is for sunday ! and two hours at prayer is not piety , it is self- importance !	it would be better that you return tomorrow , my lord .
not ready ? where is she ?	be patient , my lord , she is dressing .
be good to her , my lord !	i will .
god bless you !	thank you . let go , there 's a good nurse .
did you like proteus or valentine best ? proteus for speaking , valentine for looks .	i liked the dog , for laughs .
but silvia i did not care for much . his fingers were red from fighting and he spoke like a schoolboy at lessons . stage love will never be true love while the law of the land has our heroines played by pipsqueak boys in petticoats ! oh , when can we see another ?	when the queen commands it .
but at the playhouse . nurse ?	be still .
playhouses are not for well-born ladies .	i am not so well-born .
well-monied is the same as well-born and well-married is more so . lord wessex was looking at you tonight .	all the men at court are without poetry . if they look at me they see my father 's fortune . i will have poetry in my life . and adventure . and love . love above all .
like valentine and silvia ?	no . . . not the artful postures of love , but love that over- throws life . unbiddable , ungovernable , like a riot in the heart , and nothing to be done , come ruin or rapture . love like there has never been in a play . i will have love or i will end my days as a . . .
as a nurse .	but i would be valentine and silvia too . good nurse , god save you and good night . i would stay asleep my whole life if i could dream myself into a company of players .
he sees himself in me ! romeo montague , a young man of verona .	verona again .
your mother , and your father	from tomorrow , away in the country for three weeks ! is master shakespeare not handsome ?
he looks well enough for a mountebank .	oh , nurse ! he would give thomas kent the life of viola de lesseps 's dreaming .
my lady , this play will end badly . i will tell .	you will not tell . as you love me and as i love you , you will bind my breast and buy me a boy 's wig !
your majesty .	stand up straight , girl .
i have seen you . you are the one who comes to all the plays -- at whitehall , at richmond .	your majesty .
what do you love so much ?	your majesty
speak out ! i know who i am . do you love stories of kings and queens ? feats of arms ? or is it courtly love ?	i love theatre . to have stories acted for me by a company of fellows is indeed
and -- ?	and i love poetry above all .
but playwrights teach nothing about love , they make it pretty , they make it comical , or they make it lust . they can not make it true .	oh , but they can !
your majesty	there was a wager , i rememberas to whether a play can show the very truth and nature of love . i think you lost it today . you are an eager boy . did you like the play ?
your majesty !	why , lord wessex ! lost your wife so soon ?
as stories must when love 's denied -- with tears and a journey . those whom god has joined in marriage , not even i can put asunder .	lord wessex , as i foretold , has lost his wife in the play- house -- go make your farewell and send her out . it 's time to settle accounts . how much was the wager ?
fifty shillings . pounds .	give it to master kent . he will see it rightfully home . wessex gives his purse to viola .
`` i know not . ''	`` go ask his name -- if he be married , my grave is like to be my wedding bed . ''
`` all my fortunes at thy foot i 'll lay , and follow thee my lord throughout the world . ''	`` madam ! ''
`` i come , anon -- but if thou meanest not well , i do beseech thee -- ''	`` madam ! ''
when will you write me a sonnet , will ?	i have lost my gift .
you left it in my bed . come to look for it again .	are you to be my muse , rosaline ?
will !	i would have made you immortal . tell burbage he has lost a new play by will shakespeare .
mr. pope ! mr. phillips ! welcome , george bryan ! james armitage ! sam ! my pretty one ! are you ready to fall in love again ?	i am , master shakespeare .
but your voice have they dropped ?	no , no , a touch of cold only . we suspect he is lying but will has turned away .
master shakespeare	luck be with you , sam . sam ?
it is not my fault , master shakespeare . i could do it yesterday .	sam ! do me a speech , do me a line .
`` have not saints lips , and holy palmers too ? ''	`` ay pilgrim , lips that they must use in prayer . ''
`` thus from my lips , by thine , my sin is purg 'd . ''	`` then have my lips the sin that they have took . ''
`` the brightness of her cheek would shame those stars as daylight doth a lamp . her eyes in heaven would through the airy region stream so bright that birds would sing and think it were not night . see how she leans her cheek upon her hand . o that i were a glove upon that hand , that i might touch that cheek .	`` ay me . ''
i would not for the world !	i have night 's cloak to hide me from their eyes ; and but thou love me , let them find me here .
`` o wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied ? ''	`` what satisfaction can'st thou have tonight ? ''
she is a beauty , my lord , as would take a king to church for a dowry of a nutmeg .	my plantations in virginia are not mortgaged for a nutmeg . i have an ancient name that will bring you preferment when your grandson is a wessex . is she fertile ?
she will breed . if she do not , send her back .	is she obedient ?
as any mule in christendom . but if you are the man to rider her , their are rubies in the saddlebag .	i like her .
like you , i found him not at home !	so this is the favour you find in the chamberlain 's men .
what does burbage care of that ? he is readying the curtain for kit marlowe .	you have opened the playhouses ?
i have , master shakespeare .	but the plague
who are you , master ?	i am ethel , sir , the pirate 's daughter .
better fortune , boy .	i was in a play . they cut my head off in titus andronicus . when i write plays , they will be like titus .
i like it when they cut heads off . and the daughter mutilated with knives .	oh . what is your name ?
wait , you 'll see the cat bites his head off .	i have to get back .
my lady !	who is there ?
anon , good nurse . anon . master shakespeare ? !	the same , alas .
oh but why `` alas ? ''	a lowly player .
alas indeed , for i thought you the highest poet of my esteem and a writer of plays that capture my heart .	oh -- i am him too !
oh my lady , my love !	if they find you here they will kill you .
you can bring them with a word .	oh , not for the world !
can you love a fool ?	can you love a player ?
wait ! you are still a maid and perhaps as mistook in me as i was mistook in thomas kent .	answer me only this : are you the author of the plays of william shakespeare ?
i am .	then kiss me again for i am not mistook .
i do not know how to undress a man .	it is strange to me , too .
i would not have thought it . there is something better than a play .	there is .
even your play .	oh
and that was only my first try .	well perhaps better than my first .
you would not leave me ?	i must . look -- how pale the window .
moonlight !	no , the morning rooster woke me .
oh , let henslowe wait .	mr. henslowe ?
let him be damned for his pages !	oh -- no , no !
there is time . it is still dark .	it is broad day ! the rooster tells us so !
oh , do not go	i must . i must
oh , will !	yes , some of it is speakable .
`` good night , good night . as sweet repose and rest come to thy heart as that within my breast . o wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied ? ''	that 's my line !
i found something in my sleep . the friar who married them will take up their destinies .	oh , but it will end well for love ?
in heaven , perhaps . it is not a comedy i am writing now . a broad river divides my lovers -- family , duty , fate -- as unchangeable as nature .	yes , this is not life , will . this is a stolen season .
you can not ! not for the queen herself !	what will you have me do ? marry you instead ?
to be the wife of a poor player ? -- can i wish that for lady viola , except in my dreams ? and yet i would , if i were free to follow my desire in the harsh light of day .	you follow your desire freely enough in the night . so , if that is all , to greenwich i go .
then i will go with you .	you can not , wessex will kill you
i know how to fight !	stage fighting ! oh , will ! as thomas kent my heart belongs to you but as viola the river divides us , and i will marry wessex a week from saturday .
will ! what -- ?	a literary feud . quite normal .
marlowe 's touch was in my titus andronicus and my henry vi was a house built on his foundations .	you never spoke so well of him .
he was not dead before . i would exchange all my plays to come for all of his that will never come .	you lie .
you lie in your meadow as you lied in my bed .	my love is no lie . i have a wife , yes , and i can not marry the daughter of sir robert de lesseps . it needed no wife come from stratford to tell you that . and yet you let me come to your bed .
calf love . i loved the writer , and gave up the prize for a sonnet .	i was the more deceived .
i love you , will , beyond poetry .	oh , my love you ran from me before .
you were not dead before . when i thought you dead , i did not care about all the plays that will never come , only that i would never see your face . i saw our end , and it will come .	you can not marry wessex !
nono .	but i will go to wessex as a widow from these vows , as solemn as they are unsanctified .
will you read it for me ?	`` wilt thou be gone ? it is not yet near day > it was the nightingale and not the lark that pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear . nightly she sings on yon pomegranate tree . believe me , love , it was the nightingale . ''
`` thou need'st not to be gone . ''	`` i have more care to stay than will to go . come death , and welcome . juliet wills it so . how is't my soul ? let 's talk . it is not day . ''
a hired player no longer . fifty pounds , will , for the poet of true love .	i am done with theatre . the playhouse is for dreamers . look where the dream has brought us .
it was we ourselves did that . and for my life to come i would not have it otherwise .	i have hurt you and i am sorry for it .
the queen commands a comedy , will for twelfth night .	a comedy ! what will my hero be but the saddest wretch in the kingdom , sick with love ?
an excellent beginning let him bea duke . and your heroine ?	sold in marriage and half way to america .
at sea , then -- a voyage to a new world ? she lands upon a vast and empty shore . she is brought to the dukeorsino .	orsinogood name
but fearful of her virtue , she comes to him dressed as a boy	and thus unable to declare her love
but all ends well .	how does it ?
you will never age for me , nor fade , nor die .	nor you for me .
good bye , my love , a thousand times good bye .	write me well .
my lady viola .	my lord .
i have spoken with your father .	so my lord ? i speak with him every day .
my lady viola .	lord wessex . you have been waiting .
i am aware of it , but it is beauty 's privilege .	you flatter , my lord .
no . i have spoken to the queen . her majesty 's consent is requisite when a wessex takes a wife , and once gained , her consent is her command .	do you intend to marry , my lord ?
your father should keep you better informed . he has bought me for you . he returns from his estates to see us married two weeks from saturday . you are allowed to show your pleasure .	i do not love you , my lord .
how your mind hops about ! your father was a shopkeeper , your children will bear arms , and i will recover my fortune . that is the only matter under discussion today . you will like virginia .	virginia ? !
why , yes ! my fortune lies in my plantations . the tobacco weed . i need four thousand pounds to fit out a ship and put my investments to work -- i fancy tobacco has a future . we will not stay there long , three or four years . . .	but why me ?
will you defy your father and your queen ?	the queen has consented ?
she wants to inspect you . at greenwich , come sunday . be submissive , modest , grateful and brief .	i will do my duty , my lord .
good morning , my lord !	ah ! my lady ! the tide waits for no man , but i swear it would wait for you !
i meanyour majesty , they do not , they have not , but i believe there is one who can	lady viola isyoung in the world . your majesty is wise in it . nature and truth are the very enemies of playacting . i 'll wager my fortune .
you look sad , my lady ! let me take you riding .	it is not my riding day , my lord .
bless me , i thought it was a horse .	i am going to church .
i understand of course . it is to be expected .	it is to be expected on a sunday .
and on a day of mourning . i never met the fellow but once at your house .	mourning ? who is dead , my lord ?
he is dead ?	killed last night , in a tavern ! come , then , we 'll say a prayer for his soul
your name ?	thomas kent . i would like to do a speech by a writer who commands the heart of every player .
take off your hat .	my hat ?
where did you learn how to do that ?	i . . .
wait there .	are you mr. shakespeare ?
yes , sir .	do you understand me ?
no , sir .	he is speaking about a baggage we never even meet ! what will be left in your purse when he meets his juliet ?
i am very sorry , sir , i have not seen act two .	of course you have not ! i have not written it !
she tells me to keep away . she is to marry lord wessex . what should i do ?	if you love her , you must do what she asks .
and break her heart and mine ?	it is only ours you can know .
she loves me , thomas !	does she say so ?
no . and yet she does where the ink has run with tears . was she weeping when she gave you this ?	i her letter came to me by the nurse .
your aunt ?	yes , my aunt . but perhaps she wept a little . tell me how you love her , will .
like a sickness and its cure together .	yes , like rain and sun , like cold and heat . is your lady beautiful ? since i came to visit from the country , i have not seen her close . tell me , is she beautiful ?
and her lips ?	oh , thomas , her lips ! the early morning rose would wither on the branch , if it could feel envy !
and her voice ? like lark song ?	deeper . softer . none of your twittering larks ! i would banish nightingales from her garden before they interrupt her song .
she sings too ?	constantly . without doubt . and plays the lute , she has a natural ear . and her bosom -- did i mention her bosom ?
what of her bosom ?	oh thomas , a pair of pippins ! as round and rare as golden apples !
i think the lady is wise to keep your love at a distance . for what lady could live up to it close to , when her eyes and lips and voice may be no more beautiful than mine ? besides , can a lady born to wealth and noble marriage love happily with a bankside poet and player ?	yes , by god ! love knows nothing of rank or riverbank ! it will spark between a queen and the poor vagabond who plays the king , and their love should be minded by each , for love denied blights the soul we owe to god ! so tell my lady , william shakespeare waits for her in the garden !
but what of lord wessex ?	for one kiss , i would defy a thousand wessexes !
oh ! -- it 's -- it 's -- oh , it 's a house of ill- repute !	it is , thomas , but of good reputation . come , there is no harm in a drink .
`` poet ? ''	i was a poet till now , but i have seen beauty that puts my poems at one with the talking ravens at the tower .
how do i offend , my lord ?	by coveting my property . i can not shed blood in her house but i will cut your throat anon . you have a name ?
here we come at last , my lord !	are you bringing your laundry woman ?
her chaperone . my lady 's country cousin . my , but you be a handsome gallant , just as she said ! you may call me miss wilhelmina !	on a more fortuitous occasion , perhaps
is there a man ?	a man , my lord ?
there was a man , poet -- a theatre poet , i heard -- does he come to the house ?	a theatre poet ?
an insolent penny-a-page rogue , marlowe , he said , christopher marlowe -- has he been to the house ?	marlowe ? oh yes , he is the one , lovely waistcoat , shame about the poetry .
you upstart inky pup ! now i will show you your place , which is in hell !	you are on my ground .
what 's his name ?	i do n't know -- campbell or something ?
all right , just a few questions .	i 'd like to ask you about your hobbies .
do a little freebasemaybe , from time to time ?	or maybe just phone out for a pizza ?
turning very briefly to the subject of corporate finance -- no , this is important . leveraged buy-outs -- a good thing or a bad thing ?	with which of the following figures do you most closely identify : joan of arc , eva braun or marilyn monroe ?
squash is often used as a metaphor to represent a struggle for personal domination .	serve .
i was trying to educate you .	just serve .
in the same fashion as chess .	what ?
chess . chess is often used as well .	will you shut up and play .
you 're a bad loser .	i have n't lost yet .
i do n't want to devalue your victory , but i just want you to know : i was n't trying to win .	victory is the same as defeat . it 's giving in to destructive competitive urges .
you learn that in your psychotherapy group ?	discussion group , alex , discussion .
what do you think ?	about what ?
about this guy , this hugo person .	i do n't have time .
i 'm only asking what you think .	i do n't have time to discuss it now . i do n't care so long as he 's not a freak .
he made it clear .	why , thank you , david .
only on expenses .	it 's true . a newspaper is paying for all this . a newspaper ...
no , she 's not in . without waiting for any more , he replaces the reciever and walks to the door , where he picks up the mail . on his way back from the door , david emerges , ready to go to work .	have you seen him ?
alex , i do n't have the time --	yes or no , yes or no , yes or --
i saw my grandmother , of course , but i do n't suppose that counts . i mean , she was alive at the time .	can i show you something ?
no .	think about it .
no .	come on , david .
no .	juliet ?
you mean immoral .	i 'm only asking you both to think about it .
it 's asick idea , alex . it 's sick .	but do n't tell me that you 're not tempted by it . do n't tell me that you 're not interested . i know you well enough .
you think so ?	all right , then , go ahead , telephone . telephone the police . try again . no one 's going to stand in your way . go ahead . tell them there 's a suitcase of money and you do n't want it .
he 's still here .	he could n't get his car started .
when are you going to let the police know ?	you call them if you want .
now what else ? david i do n't know .	a spade , we need a spade -- i wish you would concentrate -- we need a spade if we 're going to dig a pit .
so who 's going to do it ?	dig the pit , i do n't know .
no , not that .	then what ? who 's going to do what ?
you know what i 'm talking about .	do i ? what ? what ? what are you talking about ?
you know what . who 's going to do it .	we all are , david , we 're all going to do it . each of us , you , me and juliet , will do his or her bit . is that fair enough ?
i ca n't do it .	i do n't hear this .
i wo n't be able to .	you 're telling me you want out ? already ? you 're telling me you do n't want the money ? hugo is going off . he smells . the flat smells . we ca n't wait any longer .
family ? family ? friends ? drugged-up wandering suicidal search of the self fuck-ups do n't have families , david .	i just thought we should discuss it .
i do n't know .	look , if i draw the short straw , then i 'll do it , but i 'm not going to do it just because you wo n't .
finished .	but not quite .
do n't you worry about that .	is this necessary ?
that was good .	can we talk about something ?
listen , it 's important . we need to talk about what we 're going to do --	just stop worrying .
what 's the problem ?	i want to talk now .
after you drink to love and happiness forever .	now .
good luck . i love that guy , but why does he have to follow us around ?	anyway , what i was wanting to say was this --
yeah , but you were good , you were really good . fucking bin-bag ' , i liked that . you were good . you explored your maleness to the full there .	you think so ?
how much did you pay ?	i do n't know .
how much did you pay ?	i do n't know .
how much ?	i do n't know .
what is this ?	security .
from what ? jehovah 's witnesses ?	there was a break-in .
does n't it worry you ?	no , it does n't . i tried to let it worry me but it wo n't . i 've worked on that paper for three years . there is a pensioner 's terror ordeal on page six every day . every day . maybe when i 'm a pensioner it 'll worry me .
what 's all this for , more security ?	i fitted a lock up there . on the inside .
what ? yes , that 's fine .	you 're sure ? there 's lots more .
no , i 'm sure , that 'll be enough .	what 's wrong ?
nothing .	you 're not eating .
not eating what ?	not eating like you used to , that 's what .
i want to secure it .	secure it ? what do you mean -- you 're gong to take it to a bank ? you 're not going to take it to a bank ? you 're not going to take it to a bank or what , you want to bury it ? is that it ?
you looking for me ?	looking for you ? yes .
what for ? what did you want ? the money ? was that it ?	we just wanted to speak to you .
who ?	your friends .
it was n't deep enough . i told you it was n't deep enough , but you would n't listen .	it does n't neccessarily matter . they do n't even know who those people are , and even if they did , they have nothing to connect them with us , nothing at all .
i 'm glad you 're so certain , alex . it makes us feel a whole lot better .	i beg your pardon ?
but they know .	they can know all they like , it wo n't do them the slightest bit of good --
they know .	they know ? so what ? they have nothing , there is nothing , to connect us to that bodies stuff .
sex lines ? is that it ? triple x-rated interactive fantasy ? old habits die hard .	yeah , i was phoning your mother .
you old devil . well , anyway , as you can see , we 're leaving .	so i gathered .
yeah , i 'm sorry , but that 's the way it is .	it 's all right . i 'll forward your mail .
no , really , i am sorry , sorry to be ducking out on you like this . i hope you wo n't take it personally .	oh , no , no , no . do n't let it worry you . not at all . it 's probably for the best .
for the best . exactly . i would n't want things to end on a downer .	not at all .
i mean , we 've had ups and downs , right -- good times , bad times ?	yeah ?
no , ca n't think of anything else that matters .	about the mail --
it 's very kind of you to offer , but --	where do you think you 'll go ?
what ?	i bought the tickets . one for her and one for me . it was my idea .
out in the woods . three bodies . decomposed . mutilated . beyond recognition .	i do n't know anything about it .
of course you do n't know anything about it . if you knew anything about it , i would n't have to send you over there to cover it .	cover it ?
well ?	but there 's no --
animals involved ? i know , but you need a change . and besides , we 're short .	i do n't know .
do n't know what ?	well , i 've got this story , it 's really good , i 'm working on , that is good , i feel it could be big , it this , eh , and it 's , you know , it 's incredible . am i right , did you say beyond recognition ' ?
is this being recorded ?	this is just an informal discussion .
are you recording it ?	what does it look like ?
it looks like he 's writing everything down .	that 's because he is . does that upset you ?
no . why should it ?	well , then ?
i 've never seen any of these men before .	take another look at these two .
i do n't know them .	and if i told you their car was parked outside , would that surprise you ?
well , is it ?	what ?
parked outside ?	no , not any more . i just wondered if it would surprise you .
that 's it , then .	that 's all ?
sorry to waste your time .	oh , no problems . do n't worry .
just one thing .	yes .
what ? uh , no , no , it 's a fake . i picked it up in thailand . the second hand does n't sweep , you see .	i see .
right .	tell you what . if you do remember seeing any of these guys , maybe you could give me a phone , on this number , any time you like .
that 's right .	what ?
well , cameron , are you comfortable ?	yes , thanks .
good . well , you 've seen the flat ?	yes .
and you like it ?	oh , yes , it 's great .
yes . it is , is n't it ? we alllike it . and the room 's nice too , do n't you think ?	yes .
spacious , quiet , bright , well appointed , all that sort of stuff , all that crap .	well , yes .
what ?	nothing . we thought you were someone else .
cameron .	cameron ?
yes .	really ?
when you slaughter a goat and wrench its heart out with your bare hands , do you then summon hellfire ?	i mean , what are you actually doing here ? what is the hidden agenda ?
when you get up in the morning , how do you decide what shade of black to wear ?	now , let me get this straight . this affair that you 're not having , is it not with a man or not with a woman ?
and when did anyone last say to you these exact words : you are the sunshine of my life ' ?	ok , so a has left you , b is ambivalent , you 're still seeing c but d is the one you yearn for . what are we to make of this ? if i were you , i 'd ditch the lot . there 's a lot more letters in the alphabet of love .
did you know --	just serve .
i thought you stopped going .	yeah , he had one too many of thise urges . you of all people should know that .
god , you two are sensitive . all i 'm doing is implying some sort of sordid , ugly , sexual liason . why , i 'd be proud of that sort of thing .	maybe you should go , alex.you 'll meet someone wonderful .
for my life ? at a discussion group ? i think not .	for the flat .
no . be someone else like him . one is enough . and what happened to that girl , that friend of yours , the one that came round . i liked her . i really felt we had something . she could have moved in . we had chemistry .	she hated you --
well , she had problems --	-- more than anyone she has ever met . in her whole life .
has he tried down the back of the fridge ? i mean , that 's where i normally find things .	he seemed like a nice guy , alex .
who was it ?	i do n't know . he sounded swedish . do you know any swedish men ? maybe it was just the emotion .
so we 'll meet him , then ?	what ? oh , yeah , sure , if you want . i tell you , every letter this guy writes to you is the same : they all begin like pure love and descend into open pornography . i dream of your thighs , the soft touch of your white skin leading me in desire , while i , aroused and inflamed -- '
aroused and inflamed .	alex .
i 'm not usually drunk .	not usually this drunk .
in a moment he 's going to tell he could have been someone --	it was you , juliet , it was you --
-- instead of what he is --	what i am .
-- which is --	-- which is a hack .
the man we know and love .	a miserable , burnt-out , empty shell of a -- alex pauses , looks at his drink , then at juliet .
know and love ?	yeah .
i think you 're lying .	you 're right .
you see , they do n't really know me .	no , alex , we do n't really love you .
have you seen hugo ?	no . any idea which channel he 's on ?
david has n't seen him either .	so i gathered .
maybe he did n't like us .	david ?
hugo .	his car 's still there .
he 's got a car ?	so what 's wrong with that ?
what sort of car ?	alex , how shouldi know ? i 'm just a girl .
i will ask you once more , what sort of car --	a blue one , ok. and it 's still there .
hugo . hugo . sorry about this , but can you open the door ? it 's us , hugo , your flatmates and companions . your new-found friends . he 's not in . he 's left and we 'll probably never see him again .	alex , the key is in the keyhole on the other side .
so ?	open it .
you want me to kick it open ?	yes .
now ?	yes .
i wonder how he did it ?	did what ?
alex .	what ? what 's wrong ?
what are you doing ?	i 'm just looking .
do n't .	do n't look ?
no .	why not ? what 's wrong , juliet ? are n't you curious ? do n't you wonder what he died from ?
no.the guy 's dead.what more do you need ?	it 's not every day i find a story in my own flat .
thats not a story , alex . it 's a corpse .	old newspaper proverb says dead human being is living story . be rational , please , and failing that be quiet .
no , alex . it 's , it 's --	what ?
unfeasible .	is that all ?
who 's going to do it ?	i thought we all were .
i do n't thinki can .	but you 're a doctor . you kill people every day .
i do n't want to . it 's different .	and now you tell me .
whoever draws the short straw does it all . that way , you either do it or you do n't . all or nothing .	ok .
be careful .	yeah , we do n't want another stiff on our hands . do n't fall through the ceiling . ok ? is he listening to me ?
stop nagging .	i do n't know why we could n't stuff it in a mattress or put it under the floor like any normal human being . we could have hid it in the fridge .
sshh .	i want my money back . excuse me .
love and happiness for ever .	for ever and ever .
david , i promise we will . keep him happy .	it 's not for me . it 's for love and happiness forever .
look over there . it 's cameron .	who ?
cameron . you remember cameron .	no , i do n't .
what 's he doing here ?	that 's not him .
well , you certainly had a good look around .	you were magnificent .
hello . hello .	who was it ?
do n't know . no one said anything . alex rendered speechless with desire . i recall that feeling , from the days when i had such a thing .	are you all right ?
no .	then let 's spend some money .
will you calm down .	yeah , you 're making us all nervous .
is this the same stuff you made last week ?	no , no , it 's different .
i hope it tastes better than the other stuff .	it tastes different .
you know , you should spend some of that money instead of worrying about it . that 's my advice .	he 's right . you 'd feel much better about it .
once it 's spent you wo n't have to worry about it .	be like a weight off your shoulders .
you know we 're right .	do n't you ?
i do n't see the point in that .	because that 's no good . remember , we did what we did , we took the money . it was a material calculation . but what 's the use if it 's underground , or in some funny bank in some funny place ? if you ca n't spend it , if you ca n't have it , what use is it ? none . it 's nothing , all for nothing , if you do that . i did n't get into this for nothing , so that i could have nothing --
leave him alone .	he ca n't stay up there .
he 'll come down . leave him alone .	yeah , he 's got to go to work , has n't he ? you think he 'll come down for that ?
no , but he 's looking after the money , so what 's the problem ?	looking after it -- he 's probably fucking well eating it .
boy , am i glad to see you .	what are you doing here ?
we have to talk .	your painful groin ?
later . but first -- him .	david ?
exactly . now i 've been thinking --	oh , good .
he wo n't do anything for me , but for you --	forget it .
he is n't safe up there . if you really cared about him , you 'd use your influence to get him down , then he 'd be safe .	and the money ?
we could put it somewhere .	where he ca n't get it ?
now you thought of that , not me .	forget it -- he 'll come down .
expecting anyone ?	no .
are n't you going to answer it ?	well , i 'm not expecting anyone either .
no , definitely not . and that 's that . i refuse to discuss it further .	it 's the only way .
i refuse .	you 're frightened .
you 'll wait in the hall ?	i 'll wait there .
and if it sounds like i 'm being killed , you 'll phone the police , you 'll tell them everything ?	everything .
everything . except maybe that it was his idea and not mine in the first place . ok ? that 's important to me . i need to die misunderstood .	alex .
what ?	as smart as you are , you 'll need a little help .
are you all right ?	yes , of course . why would n't i be ?
i do n't know . i thought maybe i was --	we were just sorting things out .
of course , but i think you 'll find the print medium provides a more lucid and detailed --	oh , shut up , alex .
it makes us feel a whole lot better .	that 's what i thought he said .
it 's about me and david .	the perfect couple , i should say .
you must n't take it so badly .	do n't worry about it . i 'd do exactly the same , but i do n't think i 'm his type .
do n't you ever stop ?	no .
stop him , alex . you 've got to stop him .	let him go . let him take it all .
interesting .	i see .
so , uh ...	what ?
what ?	you were going to say something .
it 's ok. there 's no problem .	you mean i can have the room ?
can you afford this place ?	yeah .
good evening . i 'm detective inspector mccall and this is dc mitchell . i wonder if we could ask you some questions .	what about ?
it 's about the burglary .	burglary ?
downstairs .	of course .
so i just heard her cries for help and all that , and when i went downstairs there were already those other people there , so i just stood around really , waiting -- you know how people do -- and then when your colleagues arrived i came back upstairs . and that 's about all , i think . i did n't actually see anything useful , i do n't think .	did you hear anything before he cries ?
no , not that i recall , i was asleep .	have you seen anything or anyone suspicious around here in the last few days ?
no , nothing , sorry .	well , if you do , you 'll let us know ?
of course .	and the other three people on the flat , did they hear anything ?
two ?	who said there were four ?
we understood there were four people living here . not always , of course , but now , four .	no , three . who said there were four ?
how strange . and how unsatisfactory to have misleading information . only three people here . you 're sure ?	yes , absolutely .
i see .	i doubt it . and these two other people , did they hear anything ?
no , they were asleep . they did n't even wake up .	yes . why do you think you woke and they did n't ?
loks like you had a break-in up here as well .	someone lost the key .
is this where no one stays ?	yeah , that 's right , that 's it .
no , i 've never seen them .	you 're sure of that .
yes .	that was n't a question .
why do you want a room here ?	do you smoke ?
look , it 's a fairly straightforward question . you 're either divorced or you 're not .	ok , i 'm going to play you just a few seconds of this tape -- i 'd like you to name the song , the lead singer and the three hit singles subsequently recorded by him with another band .
it 's just that you strike me as a man trapped in a crisis of emotional direction , afflicted by a realization that the partner of your dreams is , quite simply , just that .	did you ever kill a man ?
just get on with it , alex .	keep it going , alex . you 're unstoppable now .
is this what they always look like ?	yes .
i 've never seen a dead body before .	alex , i think it 's time for you to stop .
are you all right ?	oh , yes , i 'm fine , thanks , just fine .
would you like to talk about it ?	no .
do you know many of these people ?	yes . they 're my friends .
do you think you could be a little more forceful next time ?	i 'm sorry .
it 's alright . i think he got the message anyway .	that was stressful . i found that stressful .
two hundred .	two hundred pounds ?
two hundred pounds .	you paid two hundred pounds for this ?
that 's what it cost , david .	no , no , no . that 's what you paid for it . two hundred pounds is what you paid for it . we do n't know what it cost us yet , for you two to have a good time , we do n't know the cost of that yet .
expecting anyone ?	what ?
were you expecting anyone ? tonight ?	no .
visitors ? some friends maybe ? someone you talked to ?	no one . i promise .
who have you talked to ?	no one .
i thought you 'd gone to work .	with a face like this ?
i 'm sorry .	i should hope so .
we already know . all about it .	it was on the television .
so let 's go .	you and me ?
yes .	and you need your sleep .
eh , i do n't know .	oh , do n't be so coy , dear . you 're going to rio .
what ?	that 's right . you 're going to rio . rio de janeiro . on your own . come on , you should know . you bought the fucking ticket .
but i bet you did n't say you were going to split on him .	it was n't like that .
what do we do here , david ?	sorry ?
here .	right here ?
in this firm .	well , it 's a wide range of , eh --
accounting , david , chartered accounting --	exactly what i was --
-- is often sneered at . are you aware of that ?	not any real sneering as such , no .
there 's a whole wide world out there , and it all needs to be accounted for , does n't it ?	eh --
but they sneer , do n't they ?	i 'm not sure --
oh , it 's unfashionable , i know , but , yes , we 're methodical , yes , we 're dilligent , yes , we 're serious , and where 's the crime in that , and why not shout it from the rooftops , yes , maybe sometimes we are a little bit boring , but by god , we get the job done .	yes , sir .
and that 's why i think you fit in here .	i 'm boring ?
you get the job done .	oh , i see , i thought you meant --
hello .	what happened to that guy ?
what guy ?	that guy , the one that died .
what guy that died ?	that one , last week .
here ? .	yeah , here , i mean , where else ?
oh , him . well , he died .	that 's what i thought .
you must be hugo .	you must be juliet .
would you like to come in ?	i 'd be delighted .
it 's nice .	would you like to see the rest ?
what do you do ?	well , i 've been away for a bit , travelling , that sort of thing , and now i 'm trying to write a novel .
what 's it about ?	a priest who dies .
i see .	yeah . well , maybe i 'll change it .
no .	yes , i mean , who wants to read about another dead priest ? it 's about some other guy , some guy who 's not a priest , who does n't die . you see , it 's better already .
writing seems easy .	it 's a breeze .
do you think you could answer that ?	the telephone ? it continues to ring .
yes , the telephone , but if it 's for me , i 'm not in . hugo you 're not in .	no .
it was some guy called brian .	did he sound upset ?
a little bit . is that good or bad ?	it 's an improvement .
shall i answer it ?	no , just leave it . he knows i must be at home . i 'm working nights this week .
working nights ?	i 'm a doctor .
and he 's a patient of yours ?	no . but he needs treatment .
for what ?	a certain weakness .
the human condition .	you know about it ?
i write about it ?	and that 's not the same thing ?
october 15th , direct flight , london heathrow to rio de janeiro , british airways , you are looking at seven hundred and sixty-five pounds . seven six five .	that sounds fine .
air portugal , on the other hand , via lisbon , same day , five hundred and sixty-five . five six five . it 's up to you . catering important ?	what ?
air france . glasgow . direct , but then you 're looking at the wrong end of nine hundred and twelve pounds . that 's nine one two . it 's up to you .	yes , the first one 's fine . heathrow direct .
it 's up to you . air patagonia . new outfit : via caracas and bogot . no catering . four hundred and eleven pounds . four one one . good value , but refueling at bogot is variable .	the first one was fine .
take all the time you like , doctor .	i 'm sorry , i 've never seen any of them .
no . i have n't seen them .	do you think you have a good memory for faces ?
same as everyone else .	but in your work you must meet lots of different people , every day -- new people , new faces . no ?
yes .	and what do you recognize , names or faces ?
diseases .	like recognizing criminals by their crimes .
i suppose so .	i mean , that 's what it 's like .
sorry ?	and you said you supposed so , but i was n't offering it for debate .
both , sir .	excellent . dc mitchell is a rising star , mr. stevens . under my tutelage he will undoubtedly make the grade .
offering it for debate .	it 's like recognizing criminals by their crimes .
you can tell by the intonation .	one other thing . do you have any tattoos ?
your watch .	is it real ?
you 're in a good mood today , george .	yeah , baby . things are great . listen , there 's devra , whatta you want ?

do n't you think there 's too much gold ?	it 's great . you wan na speak to mary ? hold on ...
i do n't know , i think ...	look , would you argue with your doctor ?
i thought you were in a good mood .	i am ... except i 've got ta do somebody at their house .
do n't you like her ?	no , it 's a very groovy girl .
then what 's the problem ?	she 's a very groovy girl . that 's the problem .
what 're you talking about , george ?	well , it 's a small town . sooner or later things catch up with you ... do n't they ?
do you think george is a fairy ?	who ?
that kid ... the hairdresser .	well , i do n't know for sure ... he 's a hairdresser .
maybe he 's just a kooky guy who likes doing something kooky like that .	maybe ... why do you ask ?
i 'm thinking of investing with him . he worries me .	why ?
maybe he 's too flighty and irresponsible . that 's why i asked if he was a fairy .	i do n't know . he 's a hairdresser .
you suggested it , do n't you think it 's a good idea ?	yes , but ... i thought ...
what ?	that you were just indulging me .
that 's george .	it 's just -- fabulous . think you could do anything for me ?
-- yes , senator -- just a minute , dear --	lester , do n't you think that uhh --
that girl 's making an awful spectacle of herself .	what do you expect me to do about it ?
i just thought you 'd like to know --	why would i like to know if there 's nothing i can do about it , goddammit --
lester .	yes , sweetheart , shh .
-- i hope you like miss shawn --	-- what , who ? oh she 's very nice , yes -- i mean normally -- -
-- cause she 's going to be very , very expensive .	ca n't we go into this later , sweetheart ?
we can not go into this later .	that 's okay too .
-- is that right ?	-- yes , we 're all trying to do something to make this a better country to live in , believe it or not .
-- is that what this is all about ?	yes and you do n't have to be sarcastic about it , that 's a beautiful thing he 's doing -- some people do more than go to the beauty parlor and shop at saks --
lester , you 're a miserable man . you 're not helping anybody . you 're just twisting arms to raise money for a lot of silly son of a bitches that are out for themselves -- this is just business , do n't kid yourself . and you know the worst thing about it , even if it does somebody some good somewhere which i ca n't possibly imagine , you 'll never know the difference . you 're just sweating and kidding yourself - and you 're kidding yourself if you think your new business partner is going to keep his hands off that girl -- or that she 'll keep her hands off him .	what are you talking about ?
whoever she is , she does n't give up , does she ?	no .
what 're you looking for ?	my keys .
i thought you said you were n't going anywhere .	i 'm not . i mean i 've got ta see this friend of mine for a few minutes .
thanks a lot .	listen , baby , do n't leave , really .
why not ?	i 'll be right back , it 's just that this girl is a different girl ... she has attacks .
what ?	these attacks ... it 's got something to do with her ... uh ... pancreas .
she 's got a ...	does she have a pancreatic ulcer ?
yeah , i think so .	that 's very serious . who 's her doctor ?
i do n't know .	gee , that 's very serious ...
i know .	ruth lesserman had a pancreatic ulcer .
she did ?	it turned out to be cancer .
wow .	so what are you doing going over there ? you 're not her doctor .
and listen , i 'll be right back and i want your ass in that bed when i get back .	you 're very rude ... if you do n't come back --
i 'll be back in a while .	i do n't want to see you anymore .
you 're late , george .	i got ta talk to you .
i do n't want to talk about it ...	but you do n't know what happened .
i do n't care about that girl , i do n't care if she 's dead .	calm down , baby .
i 'm perfectly calm , george , i 'm simply saying you have no respect for me , that you 're incapable of distinguishing between me and one of your average hollywood ... mummers ...	-- what ?
nummers .	what ?
-- i like myself far too much , far too much .	i do n't want to place you in any position --
-- to be put in that kind of position ...	i 'll have mary wash you . mary !
george --	i 'm coming , baby -- how 's otis doing , anyway ?
i 'm not used to that kind of treatment .	what kind of treatment ?
i 've never been treated that way , and i 'm not going to start now .	jesus , i do n't know , baby , i been cutting too much hair lately . i 'm losing all my concepts ...
i can see that .	you 're looking great , baby .
what 're you doing later ?	whatever you say .
i do n't know . i 'm beginning to feel guilty .	what about ?
all i ever do is play . i should be doing something to get my own shop open .	why do n't you see lester ?
your husband ?	yes .
what about ?	the shop . i think you 're a good investment , and i do n't mind telling him .
is she all right ?	i do n't know . just a minute ...
-- anyway .	i hope she 's all right .
she 's fine . you really think i 'd be a good investment ?	i would n't say so if i did n't .
no , i know .	and i certainly would n't tell lester .
i know .	i mean it or i would n't say it .
hi .	hello , george .
comb my hair out later , honey .	no , that 's okay , i 'll do it now .
but are n't you ...	right now , i just do n't care .
why did n't you come alone ? lester invited you . did you have to bring her ?	well she ...
she what ?	she 's a friend of jill 's .
sweetheart , it 's a bore out there ... let 's lock the door .	holy christ . you want to get us killed ?
oh , no .	... what ? ...
that headboard .	nobody can hear it .
you going to answer it ?	uh-uh .

i 've been trying to reach you all afternoon . you were n't in the shop . what is this thing tonight ?	what do you mean , what is it ? it 's some political bullshit .

i know , honey .	maybe i should get a dog ... no , it would just shit all over the house and i 'd never clean it up .
what does he direct besides traffic ?	ha , ha .
television or movies ?	commercials .
now , jackie --	-- she 's a very compulsive girl .
i 've got to get her out of here .	-- go ahead .
-- well are n't you --	-- what ? -- i 'll see you later ...
i do n't want to fight , george .	i do n't want to fight either . look ... uh -- i love you .
bullshit .	i do , jill .
how come you took your own car ?	i did n't want him meeting me here .
well that 's something .	what is .
you did fuck him , did n't you ?	i 'm very tired , george .
did n't you , baby ?	let go of me .
let go of me or i 'll scream , i 'll call the police .	oh , christ .
that was him .	yes .
yes .	well , did you get a job out of it at least ?

so who else was there besides jackie ? huh ? ... huh ?	baby , do n't do this . i do love you .
obviously .	how many ?
what do you wan na know for ?	i just want to know , that 's all .
what difference does it make ?	i just want to know while we were seeing each other ... i just do n't want girls looking at me and knowing and me not knowing ...
baby , please do n't ... i love you .	i do n't want to be a fool ! ... i want to look them in the eye and say , i know !

... well i 'm glad you told me .	jesus .
what ? what ? what ? what ? what ?	... honest . at least you 're honest with me .
i wish you 'd go now .	that 's all you 've got to say ?
-- yes .	-- tell me something -- did you talk about me ?
george ...	did you ?
please ! ... that 's not like you .	yeah , i know . did you ?
george , now cut this out .	did you ?
stop it .	did you ?
yes , yes , i did .	what did you say ?
george , if you keep this up i 'm going to scream .	what did you say ?
george ...	what did you say ?
what 're you here for ?	-- a wash and set .
no .	no ?
you need a cut .	but mr. norman said --
said what !	i just needed a wash and set , a wash and set , that 's all .
felicia says you 're a very good hairdresser .	well , yeah .
she says you 're a fabulous hairdresser .	thank you .
oh , well , i went to beauty school ... you know you go to beauty school ... and you get your operator 's license ... and you graduate ... and you 're a hairdresser .	i see .
it 's an unusual trade .	yes it is .
but the important thing is you 're successful at it .	in a way . but ...
but what ?	i 'm better than the guy i work for .
well , george , i invest for a lot of people . i make a lot of money for them . more than they could do for themselves .	after a while that hurts ... does n't it ?
it 's good you want to do something , george .	thank you .
but personal services are not the kind of thing i usually get into .	they 're not ?
no , they 're a pain in the ass , there 's no way of keeping track of anything . it 's a cash business and you 've got to watch your operators or they 'll steal you blind , am i right or am i right ?	you 're right .
george , could you -- excuse us for a minute ?	sure .
felicia 's really interested in the shop , is n't she ?	oh yeah .
well , george , you may not think ten or fifteen grand means much to me , but i invest for myself and a lot of particular people .	oh yeah ? i mean i know .
when ?	when ?
tonight ?	yeah , little election party i 'm giving at the bistro . it 's a pain in the ass but -- i have to do it . we 'll have a little time to talk there .
-- maybe you could , on your way , you know , pick up jackie here .	okay .
i wish my son knew what he wanted to do .	oh yeah ?
-- anything , i do n't care what it is , just so it 's something .	i know what you mean .
sorry , honey , i ...	that 's okay , that 's okay , just shut the door .
... she 's very upset ...	what about , tonight ?
you look like you 've had quite a work-out .	it 's nerve wracking sometimes ... women can get you very upset .
i know it , i know it .	... this doing hair it 's ...
george , i know you have to deal with felicia and you 're caught in the middle , and if you can just bear with me tonight , well , i appreciate the way you 've handled the situation .	oh , hey ...
it 's a difficult situation , and i want you to know i appreciate it . tonight 's going to be real tough for me --	i do n't know what to ...
-- do me a favor , kind of keep your eye on jackie , she 's a little high strung tonight --	-- yeah ?
well anyway ...	your hair looks -- well fabulous .
well -- i could try . do you wash your hair every day ?	is n't that bad for it ?
this really ought to be layered ...	layered ?
you live like a pig .	yeah . how long have you been here ?
all night .	well ... who are those guys ?
what do they look like ? ...	look , lester ... are you unhappy with me about something ?
yeah , i 'm unhappy with you about something .	well , what ?
godammit , george ...	now wait a minute ...
sit down .	but ...
i wan na hear about it .	oh jesus christ .
i wan na hear about it , george .	hey , have 'em put me away , or whatever you 're gon na do , okay ? ... i 'm too tired to lie , i 'm too tired to tell the truth ... i 'm too tired for anything .
i wan na hear about it .	what can i say !
i wan na know your thinking , i wan na know how someone like you thinks . did you think you could get away with it , did you think you could put something over on me ? does a guy like you get his kicks sneaking around behind people 's backs and taking advantage of them ? maybe that 's your idea of being anti establishment !	i 'm not anti-establishment .
that 's got nothing to do with it ... you 're so beyond my comprehension i ca n't even discuss it with you .	then do n't ... just have 'em beat me up or whatever you 're gon na do .
was it me , did you have something against me ?	what , do you think i planned it ?
did they have something against me ?	did n't they tell you ?
i wan na hear it from you !	... how am i gon na tell you what they have against you ? i mean jesus fucking christ , they 're women , are n't they ? have you ever listened to women talk , man ? have you ? well i do , i do 'til it 's fucking coming out of my ears . i 'm on my feet all day , every fucking day , listening to women talk and you know what they talk about , do n't you ? being fucked up by some guy . that 's all that 's on their minds . i 'm sure you 've done something they could get pissed off about , what 's that got to do with it ? all women are pissed off , man , all of 'em . they fucking hate us ! do n't you know that ?
... yes , i follow your thinking on that .	we 're always trying to fuck them ... they know it and they like it and they do n't like it ... that 's just how it is ... look , it 's got nothing to do with you , man . it just happened . felicia 's got nothing to do but shop and get her hair done and she knows she 's getting older ... her daughter hates her , what 's she going to do , go to pta meetings ?
do you think lorna hates her ? i do n't think she hates her . i mean she may resent her a little ...	oh , are you kidding , man ? she hates her .
why , why do you think that is ?	oh , fuck , lester , how should i know ?
want a drink ?	no thanks .
have a drink .	okay , thanks .
you do n't have a clean glass in the house .	i know .
hell of a way to treat a business partner , that 's all i can say .	who ?
me !	hey , you were never going to give me the money .
... you can lose it all ; you can lose it all no matter who you are ... i do n't know , what 's the point of having it all . look at me . i do n't have a goddam thing ... the market 's terrible right now , went down ten points last week , goddam lyndon johnson !	oh yeah ...
yeah , , it goes up a little and then it goes down , maybe nixon will do something . what 's the difference , they 're all a bunch of jerks . i would n't let 'em run my business , i can tell you that much . not if i had any choice in the matter . i do n't know what to do with you . i do n't know , i do n't know what 's right or wrong anymore .	i do n't either , lester , i swear to you i do n't .
what about jackie ?	what about her ?
i mean , how did that happen ?	lester , it just happened .
she 's nothing but a whore .	no --
just a whore , i go over there , have a few drinks and get my gun off . i 'm through with her , she 's nothing but a whore .	no , man , no . you can say everybody 's a whore . she 's okay . i mean jackie 'll fuck around but not that much . somewhere she really likes you , lester , and it 's not just the bread . she 's okay .
you really think so ?	yes i do .
oh , by the way , i think you oughta know -- lorna thinks she 's got the clap .	what ?
what took you so long ?	was n't sure it was you .
	i ... uh ... i ... uh ... ca n't .
all right , who 're you with ? jill ?	no .
	no .
awww --	i 'll call you back .
come on by .	i 'll call you back ...
	okay , okay ...
you 're home .	yeah .
i 'm coming over .	i 'll call you back .
no you wo n't .	what do you mean ?
i told you i get 'scared up here , so if you 're not coming right now ... i 'm not kidding .	okay .
	yeah , yeah -- 'bye .
well , commercials . i read for a soap the other day .	a soap ?
a daytime soap opera .	and ?
i was too old .	what was it , somebody 's daughter ?
well maybe i can get you something .	that 's very sweet of you , mr. roth .
sid .	sid . you must be a very important executive .
well , whatever i am , i think i can get you whatever you 'd like .	you do ?
yes .	-- well , more than anything else -- -- i 'd like to suck his cock .
the man from sloan 's is coming . i called you about it .	how did you lose that key ? oh , george , this is uh miss -- this is jackie .
oh , hi , i mean hello , we 've met .	is that right ?
well , yes , george is a wonderful hairdresser .	is that right ?
i go to the blue'n gold barber shop in westwood . the guy in the third chair 's dynamite ... nobody much .	george is going to open a shop .
i called to tell you i was sending one over but the line was busy , you 're always on the phone .	i am ?
who were you talking to ?	who do you think i was talking to ?
my secretary saw you with that boy .	steve ?
steve slutes , and he 's not a boy . steve could n't get arrested as an actor . he could n't get arrested as a boy .	then you were talking to him .
i 'm always on the phone because you never let me see anybody , i ca n't even bring my girlfriends over to the house because they might run into you . you 're driving me up the wall , lester . you 're even jealous of the dogs . i mean i 've got ta have somebody i can talk to .	i 'm not jealous of the dogs .
now listen , jackie , i 'm not jealous of anybody , i just ca n't afford to get caught ... off base .	so i ca n't talk to some broken down actor , what do you think , i 'm going to tell him i 'm screwing lester karpf !
of course not .	that 's not very logical , lester .
it 's very logical , it 's the most logical thing in the world . you would n't feel this confined if we could go out with people and have dinner , and a little conversation and so forth ...	really ? how about starting with tonight ?
you and your touchy investors .	look ... you do well for people , they do n't ask you to stop . nobody wants you to stop making money , doll , not even uncle sam . they all want their share .
you 're lying about one thing , lester .	what 's that ?
maybe he ought to go to beauty school . anyway , see you tonight , doll , okay ?	fine .
shut the door , shut the door !	oh , i 'm sorry .
i 'd like a drink .	just a second , i 've got ta clean this mess up or the dogs 'll have it all over the house .
they get hair all over the place .	they 're yorkies and they do n't shed .
here .	are n't you going to have one ?
no .	why not ?
george , glad you could make it , son . hi , doll .	lester , this is my friend jill and this is johnny pope .
who are they ?	jill haynes , jill haynes , i 've told you about jill a hundred times , lester , you never remember anything i say .
does she know about us ?	jesus , she 's my best friend .
who 's the guy , george 's boyfriend ?	i do n't know . why do n't you ask him ?
hi , doll , what 's wrong ?	you know what 's wrong .
jackie shawn .	yes , jackie shawn , my wi -- felicia .
-- you phony asshole --	oh , dear that 's too bad . -- get her out of here , get her out of here .
hi , leonard .	jackie , what 're you doing ?
going for a pony ride at kiddielands , want to come along ?	i have to meet a client ... who 're you dating ?
poster-kleiser .	oh yeah ?
that 's right .	i 'll call you .
fine .	see you later .
i think you 're crazy . do n't look over , it 's lenny silverman .	who is that ?
i am ? i mean why ?	oh , honey , do n't be totally naive .
i 'm not . maybe i am .	no , listen . he 's a very good hairdresser .
well , he is .	so what 's your point ?
jill , i 'm just trying to be helpful .	i know , i 'm sorry .
i spent three years with him . i just could n't take it not knowing who was gon na pay the rent ... his unemployment or mine . george was adorable but it drove me crackers . now at least i 'm comfortable . lester does what he says he 'll do . maybe you 're happy living like a gypsy . are you ?	george is great but i know what you mean .
face it , you can go around with cute guys and get hung up on their sexy bodies and things like that but sooner or later you 've got to find somebody . face it , time is n't on your side .	i guess not .
jill , you 're a real sweetie pie . you really are . you 're sure you do n't mind ?	do n't be silly .
you 're really a love -- you sure ?	-- no . no really .
well , what is it , honey ?	nothing .
it must be something .	well , it 's george .
i thought you said things were great with george .	well they are . but we have problems . you say things are great with lester . is he going to marry you ?
we do n't think marriage is important .	but you have problems ?
-- yeah , honey ...	i do n't know . one minute he 's up in the air and makes love to me five times a day and tells me everything 's going to be great and he 's getting his own shop and then suddenly he disappears and he wo n't even talk to me . it 's driving me crazy .
five times a day ?	-- i guess it 's all got to do with this shop .
really , jill , are n't you exaggerating just a little ? five times a day ?	well , you know what i mean .
after four years ? no i do n't ... and i do n't know too many girls who do .	i 'm exaggerating .
how much ?	jackie --
what ?	well ... it 's not so much the number of times he does it , it 's ... he does it for a long time .
he does ?	well yes -- you know that about george .
it 's been so long i do n't how long ?	quite a while ... an hour , an hour and a half -- sometimes forty-five minutes -- that 's quite a while , is n't it ?
i would say so , yes .	honey ?
what ?	i think you 're going to hit that car in front of us .
-- see , i just know that if i go to egypt , well , things happen , i just do n't know what 'll happen to us , he just never seems to think ahead , does he ?	-- when you say forty-five minutes or an hour , do you mean continuous time ? just continually , without stopping ?
-- well -- not going in and out , i do n't mean just that . why are you asking me ? you went with george longer than i have .	-- i guess i just blocked it out , that 's all .
c'mon .	well , there was this one time --
-- yesss ?	-- i was in the kitchen doing the dishes and george was out in long beach doing a show ...
-- uhh-huhh ...	-- well it was very hot so i 'd left the door open and the water was running so i did n't hear him come down the stairs ...
-- he came up behind me and i was wiping a dish and he just ... lifted up my skirt , and , you know , right there ...	did n't you have any panties on ?
-- he reached up and tore them .	what did you do ?
well ... i just kept wiping that dish . maybe it does n't sound very sexy but it was .	no , it sounds very sexy -- did you just stay by the sink all that time ?
egypt ?	that 's right .
but why egypt ?	well , that 's where the pyramids are and we want real pyramids in the ad .
go ahead , jill , you can say it .	now i 'm embarrassed to tell you .
oh . thank you .	sure .
why do n't you ask for another one ?	are you kidding ? his hair 's probably the most nutritious thing in here . see , you 've reduced me to eating weeds .
... my friend does n't like it here either .	all right , forget this filth . continue about your friend .
well he 's not exactly a friend .	is he an enemy ?
of course not ... he 's sort of a boyfriend .	-- sort of a boyfriend ?
sort of .	i see . you mean he just sort of fucks you .
johnny !	my god , did i say that ? i do n't believe it .
i 'm terribly sorry .	-- never mind .
what does he do ? is he an actor ?	-- no .
good for you .	he 's a hairdresser .
-- oh , sure . a hairdresser . how ... how do you a ... meet a hairdresser ?	getting your hair done ... would you like to go to a party ?
this other couple that we 're here with , do you know them very well ?	well ... sure ...
george ? was he alone ?	i do n't think so .
that bastard .	george is a hairdresser , is n't he ?
-- jackie really should n't drink --	-- oh i do n't know --
well -- as i see it we 've got two choices . we can hang around here and wait for the bomb to go off , or we can go to my party .	let 's do that .
-- why ?	-- these bastards have me hemmed in .
oh , johnny , mr. karpf needed a ride home and i said we 'd take him . do you mind ?	of course not .
-- so when are you going to egypt ?	you mean when are you going to egypt ?
now i did n't mean that , you rat .	two weeks from tomorrow .
you 're going ?	you 're going .
you 're kidding .	those arabs wo n't be when they start chasing you around the sand dunes .
johnny ! why did n't you tell me before ?	-- just before i ask you out ? i ca n't do that . let 's get out of here before good old les catches up with us again .
what 's wrong ?	we ca n't really leave that poor man here alone .
-- still -- at least we should tell him we 're going . c'mon .	i 'm telling you he wo n't know the difference .
-- what 's the problem , honey ?	-- his car . they have it blocked .
-- listen , i wonder if you kids could give me a ride ? i 'm kind of stranded here .	sure thing , mr. karpf . c'mon .
-- i 'll get in the back --	-- oh no , honey , i 'll do that ...
-- there 's not much room --	that 's fine --
what did you say your name was , sweetheart ?	jill .
-- yes , jill .	gee ... that 's wonderful , jill .
thank you .	-- just wonderful .
you seem disappointed .	no ... how long did you say ?
look , is there somewhere else you 'd rather go ? maybe we can change our location .	no , it 's not that ...
do you have children ?	no .
are you married ?	no .
do you have something against traveling ?	no .
no !	john ...
we 'll let you know tomorrow .	please do n't misunderstand ... i 'd really like to go .
i think they 're waiting for somebody to start dinner .	have they sat down ?
no of course not .	-- we 're going to be here all night .
everything okay , son ?	terrific . now all i have to do is find my car keys .
call me les .	where to , les ?
well we 'd love to , but we 're going to another party .	well ... that 's wonderful -- i 'll stop by there for a drink .
dad ?	yes ?
i 'm hungry .	well you should have eaten your breakfast .
i think that was farther west in the sierras .	what was the donner party ?
there were a party of settlers in the covered wagon times . they got snowbound one winter in the mountains . they had to resort to cannabilism in order to stay alive .	you mean they ate each other up ?
can i go to my room and get my fire-engine ?	come here for a minute , first .
how 's it going , doc ?	okay .
are you having a good time ?	yes , dad .
good . i want you to have a good time .	i am , dad . dad ?
yes .	do you feel bad ?
no . i 'm just a little tired .	then why do n't you go to sleep ?
i ca n't . i have too much to do .	dad ?
yes ?	do you like this hotel ?
yes i do . i love it . do n't you ?	i guess so .
dad ?	what ?
you would n't ever hurt mummy and me , would you ?	what do you mean ?
did your mother ever say that to you - that i would hurt you ?	no , dad .
are you sure ?	yes , dad .
i love you , danny . i love you more than anything else in the whole world , and i 'd never do anything to hurt you , never ... you know that , do n't you , huh ?	yes , dad .
now this is where we keep all of out meat . you got fifteen rib roasts - thirty ten pound bags of hamburgers . you got twelve- turkeys , two dozen pork roasts and twenty legs of lamb . do you like lamb , doc ?	no .
you do n't ? well what 's your favorite food then ?	french fries and ketchup .
do you like ice cream , doc ?	yeah .
chocolate .	chocolate it shall be . come on son .
why do n't you want to talk about it ?	i 'm not supposed to .
who says you ai n't supposed to ?	tony .
who 's tony ?	tony 's the little boy who lives in my mouth .
yes .	how does he tell you things ?
it 's like i go to sleep , and he shows me things but when i wake up , i ca n't remember everything .	does your mum and dad know about tony ?
yes .	do they know he tell you things ?
i do n't know .	now think real hard , doc . think .
maybe he showed me something .	try to think what it was .
no , i 'm scared of nothing here . it 's just that you know some places are like people , some shine and some do n't . i guess you could say the overlook hotel here has something about it that 's like shining .	is there something bad here ?
well , you know doc , when something happens it can leave a trace of itself behind ... say like is someone burns toast .	well , maybe things that happened ... leave other kinds of traces behind .
not things that anyone can notice , but things that people who shine can see . just like they can see things that have n't happened yet . well , sometimes they can see things that happened a long time ago ... i think a lot of things happened right here in this particular hotel - over the years , and not all of them was good .	what about room 237 ?
room 237 ?	you 're scared of room 237 , ain'tcha ?
no i ai n't .	mr. halloran , what is in room 237 ?
yeah .	do you really want to go and live in that hotel for the winter ?
sure , danny , it will be lots of fun .	yeah , i guess so . anyway , there 's hardly anybody to play with around here .
yeah , i guess so .	what about tony ? he 's looking forward to the hotel , i bet .
we 're just going to go into one of the other rooms for a few minutes and talk - then i 'll come back and check on you , okay ?	okay .
we 'll get something as soon as we get to the hotel , okay ?	okay , mom .
jack ...	do n't worry , mom . i know all about cannabilism , i saw it on t.v .

now danny , when you were brushing your teeth , do you remember if you smelled anything funny , or saw any bright flashing lights , or anything at all strange ?	no .
do you remember when you were brushing your teeth ?	yes .
what 's the next thing you remember after you were brushing your teeth ?	mommy saying , 'wake up , wake up , wake up danny , wake up . '
now danny , can you remember what you were doing just before you started brushing your teeth ?	talking to tony .
is tony one of your animals ?	no . it 's the little boy that lives in my mouth .
oh ,	if you were to open your mouth now , could i see tony ?
no .	why not ?
because he hides .	where does he go ?
to my stomach .	does tony ever tell you to do things ?
now i 'm going to ask you to do me a favor , and stay quietly in bed for the rest of the day . okay ?	do i have to ?
shall we go into the living room ?	yes .
please ...	thank you .
mrs. torrance , i do n't think you have anything to worry about . i 'm quite sure there is nothing physically wrong with danny .	oh , yeah . oh , yeah , he seems absolutely fine now , but you should have seen him .
but eh what was the matter with him ?	mrs. torrance , most of the time these episodes with kids are never explained . they are brought on by emotional factors , and they rarely occur again .
have you been in boulder long , mrs. torrance ?	only about three months . eh we 're from vermont . my husband was teaching school there .
tony .	did tony 's first appearance happen to coincide with your arrival here ?
what sort of injury did he have ?	ah he dislocated his shoulder .
how did he manage to do that ?	well it 's just one of those things . you know ... purely an accident , um . my husband had oh ... been drinking , and he came home about three hours late , so he was n't exactly in the greatest mood that night . and well danny had scattered some of his school papers all over the room ... and my husband grabbed his arm , you know , and pulled him away from them . it 's ... it 's just the sort of thing you do a hundred times with a child - you know , in a park or on the streets - but on this particular occasion my husband just ... used too much strength and he injured danny 's arm .
oh i would n't think of it .	well how can i repay you ?
it 's okay , really .	well i 'm going to have some coffee . would you like some ?
sure .	great . sit down . oh these marvellous doughnuts , help yourself . coffee will be ready in a few minutes .
i 'm afraid it 's advocaat sir . it tends to stain .	advocaat is it ?
that does n't matter , sir . you 're the important one .	awfully nice of you to say . of course i intend to change my jacket this evening before the fish and goose soiree .
wo n't keep you a moment , sir .	fine .
grady ?	yes , sir .
delbert grady .	that 's right , sir .
have n't i seen you somewhere before ?	why no , sir . i do n't believe so .
ah ha , it 's coming off now , sir .	eh ... mr. grady ... were n't you once the caretaker here ?
yes , sir . i have a wife and eh two daughters , sir .	and , er ... where are they now ?
no .	he is , mr. torrance .
who ?	a nigger .
a nigger !	a nigger cook .
how ?	your son has a very great talent . i do n't think you are aware how great it is , but he is attempting to use that very talent against your will .
she eh ... interferes .	perhaps they need a good talking to , if you do n't mind my saying so . perhaps a bit more .
it 's grady , mr. torrance . delbert grady .	grady ... oh .
no need to rub it in , mr. grady . i 'll deal with that situation as soon as i get out of here .	will you indeed , mr. torrance .
just give me one more chance to prove it , mr. grady . that 's all i ask .	your wife appears to be stronger than we imagined , mr. torrance . somewhat more resourceful , she seems to have got the better of you .
i fear that you will have to deal with this matter in the harshest possible way , mr. torrance . i fear that is the only thing to do .	there 's nothing i look forward to with the greater pleasure , mr. grady .
good evening . forest service .	hallo . my name 's dick halloran . i 'm the head chef up at the overlook hotel .
good evening , mr. halloran . what can i do for you ?	sir , i 've been trying to make an urgent phone call up there ,
i 'd be glad to do that , sir . oh why do n't you call me back in about eh twenty minutes ?	thank you very much . i 'll do that .
good evening . forest service .	hallo , this is dick halloran again . i called a while ago about the folks at the overlook hotel .
oh dick , come on over and say hello to mr. and mrs. torrance .	sure .
the torrances are going to take care of the overlook for us this winter .	oh , that 's just great . how do you folks like our hotel so far ?
dick , if you 're ready to do it now , i think it would be a good idea if you could show mrs. torrance the kitchen , while i continue on with jack .	it will be a pleasure . right this way mrs. torrance .
dick , can we borrow mrs. torrance for a few minutes ? we 're on our way through to the basement - i promise we wo n't keep her very long .	no problem , mr. ullman . i was just getting to the ice cream .
glad to meet you , winifred .	nice to meet you .
mrs. torrance , your husband introduced you as winifred . now are you a winnie or a freddie ?	i 'm a wendy .
oh wendy . that 's nice . that 's the prettiest .	god . this is the kitchen , huh ?
do n't let it get you down mrs. torrance - it 's big but it still ai n't nothing but a kitchen ... a lot of the stuff you 'll never have to touch .	i would n't know what to do with it if i did .
beg pardon ?	doc . you called danny 'doc ' twice just now .
i did ?	yeah . we call him doc sometimes , you know , like in the bugs bunny cartoons . but how did you know that ?
no , we do n't mind .	good .
bill , how do you do ?	pleased to meet you .
eh - formerly a school-teacher .	what line of work are you in now ?
i 'm a writer um ... teaching has been more or less a way of making ends meet .	well this ought to be quite a change for you .
what 'll it be ?	now i 'm awfully glad you asked me that , lloyd , because i just happen to have two twenties and two tens right here in my wallet . i was afraid they were going to be there until next april . so here 's what : you slip me a bottle of bourbon , a glass and some ice . you can do that , ca n't you , lloyd ? you 're not to busy , are you ?
how 's my credit in this joint anyway ?	your credit 's fine , mr. torrance .
best goddamned bartender from timbuctoo to portland maine - portland oregon for that matter .	thank you for saying so .
how are things going , mr. torrance ?	things could be better , lloyd . things could be a whole lot better .
nothing that i ca n't handle though , lloyd . thanks .	women ! ca n't live with 'em . ca n't live without 'em !
hi lloyd . i 've been away . now i 'm back .	good evening mr. torrance .
it 's good to see you .	it 's good to be back , lloyd .
no charge ?	your money 's no good here .
i 'm the kind of man likes to know who 's buying their drinks , lloyd .	it 's not a matter that concerns you , mr. torrance - at least not at this point .
hi , babe .	hi , hon . how 's it going ?
boy , we must be really high up . the air feels so different .	uh ... huh .
sure is .	god , i 've never seen anything like this before . are all of these indian designs authentic ?
perfect for a child .	yeah .
good morning , hon . your breakfast is ready .	what time is it ?
eleven thirty - jesus !	i guess we 've been staying up too late .
i made 'em just the way you like 'em , sunny side up .	hmm , nice .
it 's really pretty outside . how about taking me for a walk after you 've finished your breakfast ?	oh i suppose i oughta try to do some writing first .
any ideas yet ?	lots of ideas . no good ones .
well , something 'll come . it 's just a matter of settling back into the habit of writing every day .	yeah ... that 's all it is .
it 's really nice up here , is n't it ?	i love it . i really do . i 've never been this happy , or comfortable anywhere .
what do you want me to do about it ?	ah , come on hon . do n't be so grouchy .
i 'm not being grouchy . i just want to finish my work .	okay . i understand . i 'll come back later on with a couple of sandwiches for you and ... maybe you 'll let me read something then .
and it will then take me time to get back to where i was , understand ?	yes .
or whether you do n't hear me typing , whatever the fuck you hear me doing in here , when i am in here that means that i am working - that means do n't come in . now do you think you can handle that ?	yes .
i had ... i had the most terrible nightmare i ever had . it 's the most horrible dream i ever had .	it 's okay . it 's okay , now . really .
no . it 's the truth , really . i swear it . danny told me . he went up into one of the bedrooms , the door was open , and he saw this crazy woman in the bath-tub . she tried to strangle him .	which room was it ?
did you find anything ?	no , nothing at all .
you went into the room danny said - to 237 ?	yes , i did .
and you did n't see anything at all ?	absolutely nothing . how is he ?
he 's still asleep .	good .
somebody did that to him .	i think he did it to himself .
get him out of here ?	yes .
you mean just leave the hotel ?	yes .
shovellings out driveways , work in a car wash - any of that appeal to you ?	jack ...
jack !	how do you like it ?
i ...	i ca n't really remember .
i do n't know .	i do n't think that 's true . i think you have some very definite ideas about what should be done with danny ... and i 'd like to know what they are .
well i ... i think maybe he should be taken to a doctor .	you think maybe he should be taken to a doctor ?
yes ...	when do you think maybe he should be taken to a doctor ?
as soon as possible .	jack ...
of course i am .	of course you are .
have you ever thought about my responsibilities ?	oh jack , what are you talking about ?
stay away from me !	why ?
i just want to go back to my room .	why ?
do n't hurt me ! do n't hurt me !	i 'm not going to hurt you .
stay away from me ,	wendy !
stay away ... !	darling , light of my life , i 'm not going to hurt you . you did n't let me finish my sentence . i said 'i 'm not going to hurt you ... i 'm just going to bash your brains in ! ' i 'm going to bash them right the fuck in .
stay away from me !	i 'm not going to hurt you .
stay away from me ! please ...	stop swinging the bat .
stay away from me .	put the bat down , wendy .
stop it !	wendy give me the bat .
stay ... stay away !	give me the bat .
stay away from me .	give me the bat .
jack , stay away from me !	stop swinging the bat .

wendy ...	go away .

i 'll bring back a doctor .	wendy ...
i 'm gon na go now .	wendy ...
mr. ullman ?	yes ?
i 'm jack torrance .	oh , well - come on in jack .
very nice to meet you .	nice to meet you , mr. ullman .
have any trouble finding us ?	oh , no problem at all . i made the trip in three and a half hours .
jack , just make yourself at home . would you like some coffee ?	well , if you are going to have some , i would n't mind . thanks .
let 's see , where were we ? yes . i was about to explain that eh ... our season here runs from oh may 15th to october 30th and then we close down completely until the following may .	do you mind if i ask why you do that ? it seems to me that the skiing up here would be fantastic .
only in a very general way .	well ...
... the winters can be fantastically cruel , and the basic idea is to ... to cope with the very costly damage and depreciation which can occur . and this consists mainly of running the boiler , heating different parts of the hotel on a daily rotating basis , repairing damage as it occurs and doing repairs , so that the elements ca n't get a foothold .	well , that sounds fine to me .
physically , it 's not a very demanding job . the only thing that can get a bit trying up here during the winter is eh ... the tremendous sense of isolation .	well , that just happens to be exactly what i 'm looking for . i 'm eh ... i 'm outlining a new writing project , and eh ...
five months of peace is just what i want .	that 's very good jack , because eh ... for some people eh solitude and isolation ...
can of itself be a problem .	not for me .
how about your wife and son ? how do you think they 'll take to it ?	they 'll love it .
been known to give a few people second thoughts about the job .	i 'm intrigued .
i do n't believe they did .	well , my predecessor in this job
the police eh ... they thought that it was what the old-timers used to call cabin-fever , a kind of claustrophobic reaction which can occur when people are	shut in together over long periods of time .
well , obviously some people can be	put off by the idea of staying alone in a place where something like that actually happened .
good morning jack . i hope you have n't been waiting too long .	no problem . in fact we had time to grab a bite to eat .
good . glad you made it before they shut down the kitchen . is your family having a look around ?	no , my son 's discovered the games room .
right there .	oh fine . well in view of all the ground that we to cover today , i suggest we go and have a quick look at your apartment and then get started straight away .
i 'd better collect my family first .	oh ...
yes , very cosy for a family , and if you feel like spreading out you have the rest of the hotel to move around in .	well , it 's very ... homely .
this is our colorado lounge .	oh , it 's beautiful . my god , this place is fantastic , is n't it hon ?
yes , i believe they are based mainly on navajo and apache motifs .	oh well they 're really gorgeous . as a matter of fact this is probably the most gorgeous hotel i 've ever seen .
even before anybody knew what a jet set was . we 've had four presidents who stayed here , lots of movie stars .	royalty ?
this is the staff wing of the hotel . none of the other bedrooms are heated during the winter .	oh !
as a matter of fact we eh ... brought a decorator in from chicago just last year to refurbish this part of the hotel .	oh well he sure did a beautiful job . pink and gold are my favorite colors .
oh ... well this is our gold ballroom .	oh , i 'll say .
we can accommodate up to three hundred people here very comfortably .	boy , i bet you we could really have a good party in this room , huh hon ?
thanks .	thank you , susie .
hi .	hi .
it 's amazing how much activity is going on today .	yes , well the guests and some of the staff left yesterday , but the last day is always very hectic - everybody wants to be on their way as early as possible .
by five o'clock tonight , you 'll never know anybody was ever here .	just like a ghost ship , huh ?
bill , i 'd like you to meet jack torrance .	how do you do ?
jack is going to take care of the overlook for this winter . i would like you to take him around the place as soon as we are through .	fine .
what time does the plane leave ?	eight thirty .
bill , would you have the torrances ' things brought in their apartment .	fine .
holy-jumped-up-baldheaded-jesus-christ !	uncle al-
if father lowe is an innocent little lamb , why has n't he picked up the telephone and called constable haller to tell him marty 's sending poison-pen letters ?	i do n't accept the idea that he knows who his letter writer is , jane . because i do n't accept the idea that there was a big bad wolf who saw marty in his wheelchair .
lowe 's car- ?	blue . this blue .
would you kids mind telling me how this guy lowe became a werewolf to begin with ?	i do n't know . maybe he does n't know , either .
can i tell you kids something ?	sure , uncle al .
the moon 's not down yet ...	damn near . now i 'll sit up with this stupid gun in my lap because i promised , but you two are going to bed . go on , now , scoot .
you always take his side because he 's a cripple ! well , it 's not my fault that he 's a cripple !	come on , jane- it was brady 's idea . i could n't stop him .
did he really get his head cut off , dad ? that 's what brady said .	if you do n't stop it i 'm going to vomit . i mean it .
what 's the money for ?	a new pair of panty hose . is it enough ?
i do n't want your money . you 're a booger .	it was brady 's idea , jane . honest to god . please take the money . i want to make up .
mom was really mad at him this time , was n't she ?	what do you expect , when he comes in smelling like a brewery and looking like an unmade bed ?
yes . go away .	let me help you up .
marty ? you okay ? you 've just been sitting here all morning .	where 's mom ?
went shopping . why ?	jane , i have to talk to you .
jane ... you do n't have to do that .	do n't tell me what i have to do and what i do n't , booger-brains .
please , uncle al .	will you ?
do n't you touch me , snotbrains !	jane-
are you all right , marty ?	all except my legs ... i do n't think i can walk .
you booger .	that 's what my sister says , too . pretty soon i 'm going to start checking the mirror to see if i 'm turning green .
not bad , huh ? my uncle al took off the regular muffler and put on a cherry bomb .	what 's that ?
glasspack . he said he 'd come over sometime this summer and we 'd soup up the engine ... but now i dunno . he 's getting a divorce and he 's in the doghouse with my mother .	for getting a divorce ?
i used to see her every day , and she never knew what was going to happen to her , and neither did i ! i mean i know how stupid that sounds , but ...	hey , take it easy . i know how you feel .
there 's something else scary .	what ?
i 've been hearing noises in there .	what kind of noises ?
rattling . rustling .	rats ...
well , it 's probably nothing . i 'm just spooked since ... you know .	yeah ... but if you hear any more noises , tell your father . okay ?
ralph houk ! you ca n't bet a manager ! stone the crows !	okay , okay . dwight evans .
mom- !	let the boy finish the game , nan .
you all right , marty ?	yeah .
there 's a saying- so-and-so was better than a poke in the eye with a sharp stick . you ever hear that one ?	no .
well , i 'm not sure that was . christ ! they better get the guy .	uncle al , what if it 's not a guy ?
huh ?	what if it 's some kind of monster ?
what 's going on at owen 's , uncle al ?	a bunch of men getting ready to pretend they 're clint eastwood ... marty , did n't anybody ever tell you that the only monsters are in comic books and drive-in movies ?
it is n't enough that the monster killed all those people- that he killed brady . now he 's got them to cancel the fair .	and the fireworks . hand me that box , marty .
yeah , okay , the fireworks . jane thinks that 's all i 'm mad about , but it 's not . them doing that is just a ... a ...	it 's just an outward symbol of everything that 's inwardly wrong in this town . not bad , huh ? i read sherwood anderson in college . i can jive that shit all day .
well ... i like it that you always know how to say things , uncle al .	i 'll give you the telephone numbers of my ex-wives , dear boy- they 'll be interested to hear that .
do n't call me dear boy .	but you are , you know- you are my dear boy .
your mom 's not around , is she ?	she and dad are out back lighting the barbecue . jane 's walking around like she 's king shit of turd mountain . like always .
yeah , winesburg , ohio , was never like that ... but i got something that just might cheer you up .	what ?
you got a pilot 's license , marty ?	do i need one ?
you gave me a heart attack , marty . i 'm dying . i hope you 're happy , because you are looking at a dying man .	it really goes fast . thanks , uncle al .
it goes fast , all right- and if your mother finds out just how fast , marty , i will have a new job . singing soprano with the vienna boys ' choir .	i do n't get you .
i know you do n't . but i want this to be our secret . you get that , do n't you ?	sure .
now i said i had something for you , as i believe you will recall .	yeah ! what is it ?
stay near the house , for christ 's sake- someone 's killing people . i have to be out of my mind to be doing this , you know .	yeah , i know . it 's great !
one of the reasons i love you , marty , is that you 're almost as crazy as i am . please do n't set off anything that goes bang tonight , okay ? just bright colors . can you tell the difference ?	yeah ... sure .
what is it ?	a tracer . you 'll like it .
thanks a million , uncle al !	you 're welcome a million , marty . stick 'em in the bushes for now .
it came for me ! i shot it in the eye ! now he 's wearing an eye-patch !	i called peltzer on my way over here , marty ! father lowe came into the drugstore two days ago for a bottle of otic solution . that 's a fancy way of saying eyewash . he 's got a corneal inflammation .
was it a prescription ?	what the hell does that matter ?
it wasn't- i 'll bet you it was n't . because to get a prescription he 'd have to see a doctor .	marty , marty , you should hear yourself !
well ... was it a prescription ?	i do n't know . but i know you did n't see any werewolf the other night , marty . you had a dream , that 's all . an extremely realistic nightmare brought on by what 's been happening in this town .
what about the baseball bat jane saw in his shed ? you know who used to have a baseball bat like that ? mr. knopfler ! he was so proud of it he used to carry it in the fourth of july parade ! jane said it looked like the green giant used it for a toothpick !	you want to know what i think ?
no- we just got you out here so we could admire your pretty face .	watch it , dear boy . i think it was a hallucination . probably a broomstick , or something .
i 'll bet you a quarter that eyewash stuff was nonprescription . and i 'll bet you another quarter he has n't said anything to mr. haller .	marty , do you see your suspect ?
do you really think that a man who took a rocket in the eye three nights ago could be out mowing his lawn ? he 'd either be in the hospital ... or dead .	i did n't shoot him when he was a man . i shot him when he was-
well ... it 's a lot easier to swallow without the hair and the foaming jaws . also , i checked on the otic solution . it was counter brand . no prescription needed .	i told you !
after marty called me with his latest thrilling tale of wonder , i did . he 's had no poison-pen complaints lodged at all .	i told you !
no ... but i found some blood , smeared on a tree trunk in that grove .	there ! you see !
it could have been anything , marty .	what about father lowe chasing me in his car and trying to run me down ? you do n't think that was a dream , do you ?
mr. haller said he 'd check him out , and guess what ? no one sees him again !	and what do you suggest i do about it , dear boy ?
i want you to turn this into a silver bullet .	you 're not going to let it go , are you ?
i saw what i saw .	marty , the moon was n't even full !
no one knows how cancer begins , either- or exactly what it is- but people still believe in it .	the kid is eleven years old and already he sounds like a jesuit . a french jesuit .
i think he 's going to come for me . not just because i know who he is , but because i hurt him . only i do n't think he 'll try again as lowe .	dear boy , you have gone right out of your mind .
yeah ? really ?	yeah . really . the bitch of it is , we still are . learn from your elders , dearies .
i suppose so . you kids ought to go up to bed .	but uncle al ! you said-
what if i say no ?	then i 'd have to kick your ass , dear boy . go on , now .
i come here because marty needs a friend .	yes ... you 've always been that to him . but if you ca n't leave your booze in whatever dump you call home , you better just stay away .
so have i , actually ... i wish it could always be like this .	see me around to my car , marty , and make sure i stay out of trouble at least that long .
remember , al ... we 'll be at the ritz-carlton in boston tomorrow night ! or at the funeral parlor . it 's stickney and-	-and babcock , i remember . now go on !
and do n't open the door for any trick or treaters even if they come !	we wo n't !
you kids go to bed on time ! you 've got school tomorrow !	if you keep doing that , you 're going to bump your head , sissy . give my love to mama- tell her i 'll see her thursday .
reverend mother , i just wanted to congratulate you .	oh ?
i have n't enjoyed mass this much in years . what a marvelous program . innovative . inspiring . you are to be commended .	well ... thank you .
i ca n't wait until next sunday , when the choir performs again . did you see the people walk right in from the street ? that music , that heavenly music -- it called to them .	perhaps .
i must tell the cardinal . i.11 send him a personal letter , describing your efforts , your bold new fight to keep your little convent alive .	really ?
really .	yeah . sister mary pat was discussing it . you know she thinks it 's a sin .
yeah . we all got caught . shoplifting . cuttin ' school . cuttin ' up some bitch with a blade . so we got ta come here . so we 'll be good , in the future . so we 'll learn valuable lessons . and i learned mine . i will be incredibly good , i will never rip out nobody 's nose-ring by accident ever again . can i go now ?	yeah , you learned a whole lot , i can tell .
okay , so maybe i 'm a nun -- so , you want to ask me something ? you want to listen , for once in your little lives ? you want to pay some attention ?	what about crack ? you a user ?
let thy thoughts be guided	what you say ?
but how ?	by a voice you hear from on high

for the first time in i do n't know how long . i wanted everything done right . open and above board . i told father antonelli i was in love . i told him it was a special love , for all the ages .	you said that ? and what did he say ? did he say you could leave her ? did he say we 'd be happy ?
what ?	you want me to go against a priest ? get excommunicated ? you think i 'm nuts ?

i was good to you ! you re nothing but no-talent garbage ! you 're a two-bit tramp !	that used to be true , vince . i was with you . but something happened . and i 'm different now . real -- different . i 've had , well , you might call it -- a religious experience . and i 've got just two words for you . and those two words are ...
oh , girls .	yes , betty ?
this prom is a real drag .	oh-huh .
oh my !	what is it , betty ?
look at that . get a gander .	oh my !
he 's so dreamy . he 's like ... a greek god . he 's the cutest guy here . he 's boss . he 's fab . he 's ...	yes , betty ?
he 's so fine .	d00-lang , doo-lang , d00-lang .
is n't it a glorious morning ? good morning , mary clarence . sleep well ?	right .
where did that come from ?	i have n't heard that song in ages . the ronettes ?
1961 ? '62 ? mary clarence , that 's when many of us took final vows . it 's the last secular music we recall .	no . hey -- he knows that you been creating now you 're gon na get a beating
the minute i saw you . i said to myself , she 's a weaver . have you ever used a loom ?	not in years .
well , it all comes back , in just a jiffy . i 'm working on a wall-hanging , of the convent .	why ?
to sell , of course . i hate to say it , but we 're in terrible trouble here at st. katherine 's . we need a new roof , the furnace is going , and there 's no money .	but do n't you get money ? from the vatican ?
mary clarence . goose . we 're completely self-supporting . like all convents . like yours .	oh , right . at my old place , we used to ... wash cars . groom dogs . so ... nice loom .
is n't it lovely ? now i 'll demonstrate , and then you can hop right in . you just draw your beater in , keep it pressed against the pick , and open the shed . then pass your shuttle , beat , and open the next shed . shuttle . beat , beat , shuttle , beat , shed . keep tension on the warp . is that clear ?	just about . show me again .
shuttle , beat , shed . and watch your heddles .	i love my heddles . show me again .
is this ... choir practice ?	sure is ! come on in , and sing a spell .
hold on .	mary clarence , could you ? mary lazarus , you 're terrific , but ... could you help us ?
you see ? we 've got the voices . they 're just allover the place . i 've heard all of you , in the shower -- you 're decent . better than me . we just need charts -- harmony -- chops .	chops ?
two days . an hour or so .	no way . we 're a choir , right ? headliners . the big room . two days a week wo n't cut it . every day .
that machine .	i know . it 's ancient .
mary patrick -- do you remember the dixie cups ?	the dixie cups ? oh my . i was just a girl . of course . spring is here the sun will shine
hold it . mary patrick , you 're a pretty cheerful person , are n't you ?	am i ?
all right , i am , i know it ! all my life , i 've just been ... upbeat . optimistic . perky . i ca n't help it . even when i was little , i remember my mother used to say , `` that child is pure sunshine . she 'll either be a nun -- or a stewardess . ''	so use it . when we sing hymns , they 're usually about rejoicing , right ? celebration . most music is . so do n't hold back . let all that joy go right into your voice . make me happy . let me hear it . perk out . perk down .
spring is here the sun will shine i 'll be his and he 'll be mine we 'll love until the end of time and we 'll never be lonely anymore	because we 're
we know you do n't want to bring pain and misery to your friends and neighbors . we 'll pray to find you some honest work .	and we know that , even though most people would call you a leech and a parasite , the lowest slug of humanity ! we know that deep down inside , you 're probably even worse . and so you truly need our prayers .
what is it , mary ?	that man -- who is he ?
jackpot ! two buckets	this is so exhilarating ! all week long , i ca n't wait till sunday , when we sing .
hurry , sister !	get moving . i 'm right behind you .
my soul was in danger i 'd fallen from grace	it 's true -- i know her .
damnation was all i could see	what a shame !
but then came an angel who whispered these words	pay attention ...
sing and the devil will flee !	were you wicked ?
which convent ? it was , um , the little sisters ... of the moonlight . in vegas . everybody used to come to mass . frank . dean . sammy . right at ringside .	enough jabber .
what ?	progressive convents . vanity . it sounds awful . it sounds just like this place .
like this place ?	i like my old convent , in vancouver . out in the woods . it was n't all modern , like here . no electricity . cold water . bare feet . those were nuns . it was hell on earth , but i loved it . this place is a hilton .
shirelles .	you know that song ?
soprano or alto ?	whatever .
mary clarence , are you with us ?	um , i do n't really know this one ...
sure . kind of ... free-lance .	free-lance ? oh really ? you think i do n't see ? you think i took vows yesterday ? i know what you 're up to . you and reverend mother .
what ?	you 're a ringer . she brought you in to replace me . out with the old .
very nice . sisters , have we learned our lesson ? i wo n't hold this little episode against anyone . i 'll try not to .	mary robert .
yeah , for one second . that was the blend -- you 've got to listen to each other . be a group .	i knew that .
of course . i 'm a nun . four popes now . the lord hates a loafer .	i hear you . how many days a week do you rehearse ?
i do n't know . mary lazarus , what do you think ? they 're pretty raw .	wet behind the ears .
it 'll be hell .	tell me about it .
do n't look at your feet , and i do n't want to see anybody counting . make it look easy . again !	right , right , cross with the left , spin and turn !
hopeless i	amateurs 2
babies	again !
she 's a pro .	what ?
is there any syrup ?	well ... see , at my old convent , i was n't always ... real popular . i was sort of selfish and ... not real helpful . okay , i 'll say it -- i was n't much of a nun . but now , thanks to all of you ... maybe i 'm shaping up .
we could cut a demo . look for a label .	that 's true , would n't that be great . of course , we never know when things are going to change . any one of us could be transferred to another convent , tomorrow .
van cartier .	you know ? about me ? about everything ?
hey -- you re supposed to be the cheerful one . why do i suddenly feel like snow white ?	you re okay -- for a civilian .
just sing !	sing !
come on , we 're late .	what ? what time is it ?
it 's after five . we have to bathe .	five a.m. ?
what ? what does she want now ? i did the dishes . i oiled the pews . i dusted the hymnals . two hundred hymnals . why ca n't people share ?	i ... i ...
what ?	i ... i brought you something .
a cigarette ?	an extra heel of bread . please take it , you need your strength . you 've been working so hard .
thanks . so which one are you ? sister bruce ? sister doug ?	mary robert . i 'm ... mary robert .
so , bob , how long have you been in ? st. k 's ?	three years . sister .
three years . a rookie .	a novice .
you have to help me	right , sure , but what 's the problem ? are they keeping you a prisoner here ? do they drug you ? did reverend mother like , kidnap your parents ? we can call the enquirer .
no , you do n't understand -- i do n't want to get out ! i want to get in ?	excuse me ?
oh . mary clarence , i 'm so unworthy . i want to take my final vows , i would do it tomorrow , but reverend mother wo n't let me !	she wo n't ? why not ?
she says i should wait . she says that no one should become a nun as an escape from life . she says that i 'm not experienced enough to make the decision yet . in a mature manner .	she said that ? reverend mother ?
well , then there 's only one thing to do .	what ?
we must do this sacred thing , mary robert .	of course ! we must do it ! it 's the will of god ! what is it ?
we must ... get you some experience . we must ... leave this place .	are you sure ?
mary clarence !	now you .
we need experience .	it 's part of st. katherine 's new community outreach program . how old are you ? you should n't be smoking . have you ever seen a diseased lung ? hand 'em over .
bobs	experience ! right ?
i have to do this . so i can become a nun .	initiation . you understand . later on , we make her wear her underwear on her head .
who are all these people ?	this is your neighborhood . your turf . you should get to know 'em .
i 'm getting experience .	you watch yourself !
those people are wonderful ! why do n't we ever see them in church ?	good point . especially that dude you were with . i 'd like to see him down front .
mary clarence ! you 're so ... different from the other sisters . sometimes , well ... sometimes you sound more like a layperson .	honey .
i ca n't wait to tell reverend mother about all my experiences . i 've learned so much .	well , you know , you do n't have to tell her everything . i mean , nothing really happened . we just ... took a walk .
mary clarence !	keep moving !
goddamn it !	mary clarence !
oh my lord !	experience !
what was all that ? who was that man ? why would he shoot at us ?	i do n't know , some people just do n't like nuns . i wish i had a ruler .
mary robert , i am so sorry about last night ...	now stop that . you did n't shoot at me . you were only trying to help , to give me experience . i tried to explain that to reverend mother , but -- i do n't know if she understood .
what ?	mary robert , i 've watched you . you never really sing . you whisper . nothing comes out .
i do n't want to mess anyone up ...	give me a c. a c !
we 're the sisters of the sacred heart we do our bit , now do your part	honor thy mother and thy father too do n't kill , do n't steal , it 's bad for you
yes , prayer is the answer , and prayers free we 're going to give free prayers to everyone who drives up to this house .	we 're nuns !
it 's contraband . do n't ask . but i wanted to give you a treat . a sort of ... thank-you gift .	a thank-you ? for what ? you 're the one we should be thanking .
are you leaving us ?	oh no . we 'll always be together .
the council of cardinals ! i 'm so nervous ! what if i forget the words ?	right to hell . just kidding . where is that bus ?
wait , this is n't the way . who are you ?	they 're from my old convent .
run ! take off !	again ?
but what do they want ? where are we going ?	she 's got nothing to do with this . let her go .
mary clarence !	bless you .
i was downhearted	it 's true !
i was hell-bound , yes that 's what they say satan was waiting	do n't you know it !
but the lord came to me	what did he say ?
a convent ? they put me in a convent ? what 's the problem ? was n't there any more room in hell ?	what is your full name ? your christian name ?
mother theresa . gandhi . do n't you understand ? this is all a mistake . i 'm the good guy . i 'm the witness . and i 'm being punished !	your name ?
christy . christy van cartier .	enough joking .
that 's my real name ! currently i 'm a singer . sort of .	very well .
st. anne 's ?	parochial school . akron . st. android 's .
you were unhappy ?	i was expelled ! when i was fifteen ?
the reason ?	beats me ! what do you think ? smoking ! heavy petting , without a chaperone . heavy petting , with the chaperone . and wearing a black bra , under my uniform . the demon bra .
i see .	you see ? you see ? i have to get out of here i have to make a phone call . do n't you get it ? i 'm in a convent ! you 're a nun !
sit down .	what ?
miss van cartier .	what ?
it has come to pass .	what ?
i joined this convent some thirty years ago . at that time , the world knew some measure of peace . and hope . our order was a beacon of hospitality , to families , to children , to a neighborhood filled with promise . and , as the years have passed , i have watched that promise destroyed . drugs . gangs . spandex . and . so i have made this convent an oasis , a retreat from horror . and now that horror has invaded these sacred walls .	are you talking about me ?
and all those like you .	you mean black people ?
absolutely not . i mean the wicked . the heedless . and their las vegas concubines .	what 's a concubine ?
fine . got it . look , the way i see it , i 'm stuck here , right ? i mean , i 'm here or i 'm target practice . so here 's the deal -- i do n't bug you , you do n't bug me . i 'll catch up on some sleep , watch some tube , lay back and lay low . so just get me a key and show me to my room , and do not disturb . capisce ?	of course . but it 's almost lunch .
cool . is there a menu ? or buffet ?	before we do , you might like to freshen up . and you 'll certainly want to change
how about a robe ? one of those big terry cloth jobs , with like embroidery on the pocket . `` guest of st. katherine 's ''	would you like that ?
excused . open the cabinet to your left . you will find appropriate attire .	can do .
no ! no ! i ca n't do this !	normally dressed , you are a sore thumb , and you endanger us all . while you are here , you will conduct yourself as a nun . only i shall know who , and what , you truly are . you will not disrupt the convent . you will not influence the sisters with your colorful street talk . you will draw no attention to yourself in any way .
but look at rites look at this ! i 'm a nun ! i 'm invisible ! i 'm a penguin !	as of now , and until you leave , you are sister mary clarence .
the mary is in deference to the holy mother , the clarence in honor of saint clarence loyola . there are three vows that every nun must accept . the vow of poverty ...	no problem .
the vow of obedience .	like to who ?
and the vow of chastity .	i 'm outta here .
sisters , for the rest of the day we shall declare a vow of silence .	a what ?
surely you are familiar with this practice , mary clarence . only when our lips are silent , can our prayers truly be heard .	silence ? no talking ? all day ?
as a new member of our order , i think you might also enjoy a ritual fast .	a what ?
a fast . to remind us of the poor , of those who must endure without enough to eat .	no food ?
is this all the food i get ?	yes . until breakfast .
this shall be your cell , mary clarence .	my what ?
you were right the first time . is this like , solitary ? the cooler ? where 's the furniture ?	our lives are simple . we have little need for material possessions .
right , sure thing . but what about , like , appliances ? like a little color portable ? boom box ?	useless distractions .
it 's like the stone age . the room time forgot . what about a phone ?	and whom would you call ?
oh , i do n't know ... satan ?	your cell is more than adequate .
right . so what do we do now ? ping- pong ? row over to the monastery ?	it is nine p.m. pleasant dreams .
wait . no . you 're kidding . lights out ? at nine ? my day 's just starting .	i 'm sure . if i were you , i would use this time , to think about my life . and its direction . or lack thereof .
what 's wrong with my life ?	from all i 've heard , just about everything . your singing career seems all but nonexistent , and your married lover wants you dead .
yeah ?	girls , this is sister mary clarence . she 'll be minding you until sister mary patrick 's return . mary clarence , please assign a biblical passage . do not attempt discussion . am i understood ?
i got it .	come , sister .
deal with it , sweet thing . it 's important , nowadays . you just practice at home , with a balloon and a banana .	mary clarence !
a balloon and a banana ! tell me , mary clarence , what were you thinking ?	those girls were asking questions . they 've got it rough . i wish somebody had talked to me about that stuff when was their age . i wish somebody would talk to me about it now .
this is a convent , not a clinic . we offer moral guidance , not hardware .	have you been out in those streets ? do you know what those kids are up against ? you should help them !
sometimes it 's not enough !	you are correct . sometimes prayer alone can not help a situation . such as your own , for example . how do you feel about physical labor ?
it never solves anything .	do your recall the words of saint peter , in ecciesiastes 1:27 ? he spoke unto a wastrel youth . he said , `` take up thy task , and know ye the path of contentment . ''
in english ?	how to put it ... ah , of course , mary clarence . `` no pain , no gain . ''
really catching on .	good . mary patrick , i need you in the office . mary clarence , carry on .
i 'm sorry , i 'm not a weaver !	months of work , and the loom , absolutely ruined !
so ... hi there .	i do n't believe we have anything to say to each other .
mary robert 's life was in danger ! your behavior was inexcusable !	i know ! i 'm sorry i did n't mean for it to happen ! and i was the one they were shooting at !
mary clarence , i have given you every opportunity . to change . to make a decent life for yourself .	a decent life ? excuse me ? as what ? a janitor ?
clearly , you have learned nothing . and you present an ongoing threat , both to this convent and to yourself .	but you ca n't kick me out ! guys want to kill me ! you 're a nun ! a big nun ! are n't you supposed to have compassion ? for the wayward sheep ? i mean , i 'm a major sinner ! all-time great ! hall of fame ! are n't i , like , your dream come true ? your olympic event ?
mary clarence , perhaps you are correct .	i am ?
you may stay . but i shall restrict your activities to but a single task .	what ?
you will sing , and you will sleep , ' that is your schedule until you depart . as almost no one attends mass , you will be unable to cause further damage .	no . no .
you 're my olympic event .	not the choir , please , anything but that . the choir -- i mean , have you heard them ? i 'll do anything , scrub floors , toilets , you name it , but not that i
i was thinking las vegas . get some butts in those seats .	and what next ? popcorn ? curtain calls ? this is not a theater . or a casino .
exactly . people like going to theaters and casinos . but they think church is for grandma -- we could change that . pack the joint .	through blasphemy ? you have corrupted the entire choir !
hold on . that 's not fair . i worked hard with them . they gave up their free time , and they loved it . those women are happy . and we can get even better . we can wake this place up .	out of the question .
please let me try . i 'm begging you .	and i am refusing . as of tomorrow , mary lazarus will resume her leadership of the choir .
and on such an occasion , i feel a completely traditional program will be best .	what do you mean ?
is n't that why we were asked to sing for those cardinals ?	i believe this can be settled by a simple vote .
a vote ?	of course . mary clarence , a convent is not a totalitarian state . most major decisions are made by the membership as a whole . a membership that , i am certain , will vote in a rational and pious manner . all those in favor of allowing mary clarence to select a program ?
but ... wait a minute ...	the majority has spoken .
you sent for me ?	you have a phone call .
hey -- your prayers have been answered . i 'm leaving . in just a couple of days .	really . well , that makes two of us .
what ?	i have submitted my resignation to bishop o'hara . privately . i have asked to be relocated as soon as possible .
but -- why ?	i must go where i can be of use .
but -- there 's so much more to do right here . and look , if it 's about me , i mean , i 'm gone .	indeed . after how long ? a few weeks ? i have been here thirty years . and yet , it would seem , i know nothing .
but everything that 's happening is good ! you can be a part of it !	a part of what ? mary clarence , it is one thing to rabble rouse , to sweep into town and declare a holiday . you have raised the sisters ' expectations , you have excited and confused them . they imagine this neighborhood to be some sort of delightful ongoing block party .
you and i know that life is not so simple . there will be disappointments . rude shocks . and you will have vanished . how ... fortunate .	okay , so i just got things started . but you could build on that . you could keep it going .
i am sorry , mary clarence . i seem to have misplaced my tambourine . good day , mary clarence .	but ...
what are you doing here ?	saving you . move !
reverend mother -- thank-you .	oh ?
you saved my life .	i 'm a christian .
then i guess you 're stuck . life sentence . no parole .	very well . i hold you responsible for all of this , for introducing a lounge act into my convent . for utterly disrupting our way of life . and for placing all of us in mortal danger . thank-you .
i do n't think so . what about skydiving ? a crank call to billy graham ?	you have evidenced great maturity , mary robert . we shall have a serious discussion .
what about me , reverend mother ? i think you were right . i 'm just a bad influence . sister show biz .	perhaps not . perhaps we can all use ... a little spandex .
really ? and maybe shorter habits , and women priests , and sleeping late ?	do n't push it .
from vince ? what a guy . doo-lang , doo- lang .	at least he 's not a cop . at least he can afford a decent gift .
i used to buy.you , ..stuff . on your birthday . when we were seeing each other .	yeah , like what ? quilted coat hangers , that your mother picked out ? lottery tickets ? a travel iron ?
so i do n't shop .	'cause you 're always out , arresting people . making trouble . i do n't know why i went out with you in the first place , it was embarrassing ! i could n't hold my head up , i used to tell people you were a security guard !
he 's a businessman .	a what ? when are you qonna wake up ?
when are you gon na get off my case ? have you got a search warrant ? what do you want -- cheap thrills ?	information , baby . i thought maybe somebody around here might have a conscience .
right between the eyes ! down and out ! the guy was gone ! i ... i could n't believe it !	you could n't believe it ? vince the prince ?
i do n't know anything about bodies ! i mean , he did n't bring it home . he was good to me ... sometimes . he was sweet . he took care of me . who am i supposed to go out with ? he owns a casino . he let me sing .	he did n't do you a favor .
and if i do n't ?	then-you run .
ten flights ?	you 'd lose . you 'd die . all over the sidewalk . and into the street .
all right ! i get the picture ! i 'll do it ! i 'll testify !	get a stenographer .
okay , here 's what i want . i know about this stuff . a five-star hotel . with room service .	maybe hawaii .
jesus , what do you think this is -- wheel of fortune ? let me spell it out for you . you have to hide like you do n't even exist . you have to get so far hidden away that you never see sunlight .	okay -- no limo .
no nothing .	what 're you gon na do , put me in a bag and bury me ?
i hate you . i totally hate you .	safest place in the world . you think vince would look for you here ?
nuns , eddie . there are nuns here . everywhere . it 's crawling with 'em .	it 's a convent . all you have to do is shut up , behave yourself , and get along .
and one bullet . that 's all it 's gon na take .	but vince has contacts all over the place ! this is san francisco ! they 'll be looking for me !
everywhere but this little hole-in-the- wall convent . nobody knows you 're here but me . we 're trying to get a quick court date . a month , maybe two , tops . i 'll spring you as soon as i can .	i ca n't stay here ! i 'll crack up ! eddie , what am i gon na do ?
eddie , you 've got to get me out of here .	not again . you ca n't keep calling . somebody 's going to catch on to where you are .
but i 'm going insane ! all these people do is pray and work , work and pray ! i do n't get it -- when 's the weekend ? they have gruel , eddie , that 's what they call food ! gruel -- it 's like alpo for nuns ! i sleep in a cell , on a board , and i pray five times a days do you know what i pray for , eddie , do you have any idea ? check your crotch , eddie -- anything fall off yet ? get me outta her !	calm down . look , i did n't want to tell you this , but we 've had some problems with our protection program lately .
like what ?	keeping our witnesses alive . we hide them , but there 's a leak in the department , and they end up dead .
i just need a few more weeks ,	but it 's a nightmare ! mother superior is out to get me ! she hates my guts ! she keeps thinking up new kinds of torture !
do you hear that ? that choir ? eddie , in here , that 's what they call music !	do n't call again . it 's not safe . i 'll be in touch .
what 'd she say ?	you blew it -- big time . she does n't want you back .
does she know people are trying to kill me out there ?	she 's counting on it . she 's concerned for your safety , but she wants me to try and find another convent that will take you . or a carnival .
so what am i supposed to do in the meantime ?	go in and talk to her . it ca n't hurt . go .
eddie ! you scared the hell out of me !	what if i was vince ? you 'd be dead right now . what are you doing giving interviews on tv ?
it was n't my fault ! they just showed up . it 's helping the convent .	you 're supposed to be hiding out !
i really ca n't talk about it now . the place is packed . sro . i 've got a show to do .	listen to yourself . this is n't a career opportunity .
i know that . this is n't about me . it 's about the choir . you should hear them . they 're good . really good . and i taught them .	jesus , look at you you 're glowing .
i am ?	yeah . you look ... great . i mean it..
really ? lieutenant ?	i 've been worried about you .
you mean -- worried about my testimony ?	no -- worried about you . personally .
well.. thanks . i 've been thinking about you.. - sometimes . i mean , there are n't a lot of guys around here . i mean , sometimes i feel like ... a nun .	me too .
you 're not ... seeing anybody ?	no . most of the time i 'm thinking about you . and now ... you 've really changed .
i have ?	you re sort of ... radiant . your eyes are shining . you 're rea1ly different ...
i 've got to go .	just remember - you 're a target . do n't you think vince has a t.v . ?
vince knows you 're here .	how ?
i ca n't go with you .	what ?
i 've got a show -- at st. matthew 's cathedral . we 're singing for the cardinals .	you 're gon na be singing for st. peter if you do n't get your ass out of here !
eddie -- i 've got to go back . they wo n't sing without me . i 'm deserting them .	i think they 'd understand .
they need you ? a bunch of nuns ? for what ? moral guidance ? make-up tips ?	you do n't get it ! it 's a big thing for them , it 's like ... caesar 's palace . prime-time . they 're singing for the cardinals . it 's like ... `` star search . '' if first prize was a trip to the vatican . they 've worked really hard , they deserve this .
what 're you doing ?	even nuns have to pee .
do n't you have a concert to go to ?	that depends . sisters , you do n't know this , but reverend mother 's been making all sorts of noises about resigning . that 's bad news . i do n't know if we could sing , if we thought that was true .
yeah , eddie , thanks a whole bunch . thanks for sticking me in a convent . so you think , after all this , maybe i really am a nun ?	i do n't know . there 's only one way to be absolutely sure .
hey , girls .	hail , mary .
jerusalem is a real drag . everybody hates me .	oh-huh .
people throw stones . they call me names . i mean , really .	really .
we could put you into our witness protection program .	a hiding place .
then one day they find you .	they open a window .
jesus . data-base hoods . it 's a wonderful world . beloved daughter missing . reward of two hundred and fifty thousand dollars . please find our adored angel , we miss her so . dead or alive .	vince is getting desperate . where is she , eddie ? where 'd you stash her ?
where 's who ?	you wo n't even tell us ?
we 're looking for mike .	you found him -- but we 're not open yet .
i 'm sorry -- i do n't know what gets into him .	who are you guys ?
but you did n't tell me !	we did n't tell you what ?
a nun ?	i 'm telling you !
vince -- is she ... okay ?	maybe .
and if she runs ?	take care of it .
he 's so damn cocky . this is different .	it 's a bluff , vince .
it 's done ?	not ... totally .
but , vince , how do you know she did n't like , join up and become a nun when she was in that convent ?	it did n't happen .
i ca n't believe this . okay , i want both you guys to go back there , and both of you shoot her at the same time .	yeah ...
well ?	it did n't work , vince .
right .	so , take it off .
i 'm telling you , she 's not a nun ! get her out of the nun outfit , and put her in some clothes .	maybe pants .
get her !	which one !
there she is !	which one ?
i ca n't see anything in here !	willy -- hit the lights .
joey ?	where is she ?
but , boss -- she 's still , you know , a nun .	she 's a broad ! got it ! just some broad !
so that guy in the bar was right ? she 's like ... some kind of nun ?	yeah , right -- when i see it .
she 's gettin ' away !	forget her ! we got the one we need ! step on it !
she was real quiet and peaceful all the way back in the car .	no smart-ass remarks or nothing .
you did n't shoot !	neither did you !
i figured if you were gon na , then i would n't have to .	that 's what i figured , too .
strip down a nun ? you want us to fry ?	for like , twelve zillion eternities ?
a sweater .	and then we can ice her . no nun , no evil eye .
what 's she doing ?	she 's praying .
are you going to shoot us all , tough guy ?	is it worth it ? a lot of witnesses here .
it should be here any minute .	dress rehearsal at four , performance at 8:30. sharp .
we sound terrible we need mary clarence .	we 're losing it .
look what she did with the choir . she made us sing beautifully .	that should have tipped us .
we 've got to save her !	we ca n't leave it up to the feds !
yes , mary patrick ?	reverend mother , on behalf of the sisters , i 'd like to welcome mary clarence to st. katherine 's .
sister mary patrick ?	yes ?
mary clarence -- how is your weaving progressing ?	oh , she 's doing just fine , reverend mother -
bless her ! there are so many problems in this neighborhood that we could help solve . that 's why many of us became nuns . it 's marvelous , reverend mother .	really ...
she should n't have come back . she knew she was in danger .	but -- why would anyone kidnap a nun ?
she told us about one . the little sisters of the moonlight . in las vegas .	all right . it 's a beginning . las vegas , nevada .
peace on earth .	however , we can also pray for other things .
is this like your old convent ?	which convent was that , sister ?
mary clarence has a background in music . that 's what reverend mother said .	really , mary clarence ? were you a choirmistress ?
we did it ! we actually sang a chord !	that was exciting !
he 's not like other guys .	he 's decent .
i 'd rather sing than do anything !	it 's better than ice cream .
but , reverend mother -- everyone loves our new style .	it 's brought people back to the church .
ice cream !	mary clarence -- you should n't have . where did you get this ?
mary clarence , do n't be silly . you 're an example to us all . you 've taught us so much . we 're singing for the cardinals , and then -- who knows ? maybe the choir can travel -- to schools , and nursing homes .	maybe we can get some of the local kids to sing with us .
mary clarence ! sister !	it 's no use . she just is n't here .
we ca n't sing without her ! what should we do ?	we 'll pray -- and she 'll be there .
you mean -- they kidnapped her ?	yes -- two men -- and they had guns .
an ... entertainer ?	she was n't a nun ?
well , i do n't care who she is . we ca n't sing without her !	she 's our inspiration !
it 's so beautiful ...	and what a lovely name . las vegas ...
the little sisters of the moonlight !	but how do we get there ?
excuse me -- has anyone seen a nun ?	a benedictine .
mary clarence -- you 're alive !	christy .
not a note .	impossible .
i do n't understand . where is she ?	her whereabouts are unknown , and we must proceed without her . pull yourselves together .
calm down . think clearly . mary robert , do you have any idea who those men were ?	she said they were from her old convent .
las vegas -- she 's here somewhere .	but where ?
reverend mother ?	yes ?
absolutely not . i am very sorry , but no .	we can save this young woman 's life , and imprison a parasite -- all in one gesture .
but she 's been exposed to the underside of life . she is the underside of life .	and therefore an ideal prospect for rehabilitation .
we 're a small convent , bishop . surely there are ... more appropriate shelters .	your small convent is in danger of closing , reverend mother . the las vegas police department has offered to make a generous financial donation .
but , bishop ...	st. katherine 's is a benedictine order . you have taken a vow of hospitality . to all in need .
i lied .	i know .
but , bishop , surely you realize -- this is a most dangerous neighborhood .	and you 'll face that danger head-on . as if i could stop you . and you have my complete support in this matter . anything you can do to revitalize this neighborhood would be a blessing .
i mean , wo n't she talk ? she seemed kind of upset .	she did . bring her back . now . for a talk .
soon , you gorgeous thing ... tell me ... how lonely ?	it 's that call you were expecting , vince .
she 's a nun , vince .	i love you , chris . i always will . i gave you so much . my time . my affection . a big-time career . and how do you repay me ? what 's the thanks i get ? where 's the loyalty , huh ? where 's the love ?
and who are you to talk ? you were nothing . you could n't even sing . i must have been out of my mind .	she 's acting weird , vince . ever since we picked her up .
she 's ... she 's a nun .	are you nuts ? she 's not a nun . it 's christy . she 's a babe !
we both missed .	okay , so the problem is still the nun outfit , right ?
where ?	find 'em !
if we could speak alone .	this is not a time for frivolity , katrina , is it ? am i mistaken ?
excuse me , gentlemen , but ... who has seen this horseman ?	many have .
who took the meat ?	must have been the redman . a lenape indian lives in the western woods .
hail , constable . how are you ?	well enough . your gathering does honor to the deceased .
um ... i ... i did not ... no . why ?	sarah has gone missing ... my servant girl . her things are gone . damn it . she has joined the migration out of town . what about breakfast , woman ? or , am i to starve to death ?
clergyman steenwyck is calling a meeting . this time he is determined to have you forced out , or worse .	how did you hear this ?
certainly not .	excuse me , miss ... they have a laugh at your expense .
we have n't heard your name yet , friend .	well , unless your name is baltus , you should not worry over mine .
what the hell are you doing ?	you are the blacksmith . ever shod a horse with a hoof this large ?
they spend two days in chains .	two days ... ? for murder ?
constable crane is not the only one who fights with science on his side .	i fired upon the horseman and the bullet did nothing .
you must have missed your mark .	i hit him square .
an honor , gentlemen . in time i will need every detail of the three murderings you 've had , but , for now , i ask only if you have any theory at all as to who the killer might be ?	excuse me ?
i say , is there any one person suspect in these acts ?	i was afraid of this .
why did you move the body , doctor ?	to place it inside its coffin .
no bleeding .	what is that ?
we must be a curious sight to him .	what are you spying on ?
he is a behemoth .	a diseased monster .
the wounds are the same . cauterized . no chopping or half-measures either . one stroke took the head . have you seen , doctor ... ? even the spinal bone ... sliced as smooth as butter .	i do not care . you are welcome to use my work area , but i beg you ... return her to her resting place .
keep still , constable . you were half-drowned when they found you .	... brom bones ...
he is dead . you would be also , if your wound had not somehow shut .	bring young masbath here .
you need to sleep .	bring him .
it has been a terrible jolt to her nerves .	you will stay at her side ?
... help yourself , you pompous ass . i will be in bed .	would you stay , doctor ? i may need assistance .
stains of blood .	what of it ?
no clotting or gathering of pus . no healing at all .	what ?
why not tell us what you have heard ? hmm ? how much have your superiors bothered to tell you ?	all i know is three are slain , their heads found severed from their bodies ...
it is sacrilege !	i can not proceed without examining the previous victims .
i will not allow it . i will not !	protest to my superiors if you like .
your superiors are two days away !	then , you should have left two days ago , because i have men willing to help me today .
for poaching . or , would you remake our laws now that magistrate philipse has given up the ghost ?	does that look like an animal hanging ?
only if i repeat them outside this room . and , i will if i must ... out there , for all to hear . or ... you may speak , as planned . but , you tell them you feel compelled to move on to greener pastures .	no . you will not run me out . no one will believe a word of what you say .
oh ? far as i can tell , a rumor does not travel alone for long here .	are you a deist ? is that it ? a free thinker who does not believe in divinity .
it is only important what you are . an adulterer ...	i am the lord 's voice in this town .
wallowing in sin and lust ...	they need guidance .
wallowing quite literally in blood .	damn you , sir ! god damn you to hell !
you are so upset now ... and yet , you seemed in such good spirits last night .	you can not do this . i am a man of god !
taken . taken by the headless horseman . taken back to hell .	pardon me ?
just a moment ... are you saying it is he ?	when a goblin leaps from the nether world , others follow . poltergeists of the air , water and earth follow and cheer his desecrations !
do you have these persons ' wills ?	i have everything ... last testaments ... birth certificates , death certificates ... deeds .
may i see them , master hardenbrook ?	hmm ? see them ?
may we look at them now ?	of course . you want them ... it shall not take long . wait here .
maybe you should take this .	a fine idea .
damn ... damn ... damn ...	master hardenbrook ...
perhaps , i could assist in finding them ?	well ... that might be ... helpful .
just a moment ... if i may . it is possible this man was murdered .	he drowned . anyone could see .
he will be burned pursuant to statutes of health .	i could determine if he were dead < u > before < /u > he went into the hudson .
our first night watch is adequate against fire and some violence , but if we were more often able to ensure justice , after the fact , then criminals would truly have something to fear from law enforcement .	have they nothing to fear presently ?
without disrespect , look around you . we overflow . as do our courts .	and , < u > with < /u > disrespect , constable , if jails and courts overflow , it is testimony to success , not failure .
very few , if any .	even though i have seen confessions pried from the lips of the accused , often quite literally ?
for one who calls himself a federalist , your mouth reeks of republican liberalism .	not liberalism . equanimity .
there is a farming community upstate , constable ... ten days journey north in the hudson highlands . it is named sleepy hollow . within a fortnight , three persons have been murdered there . each with their head lopped cleanly off . the elders of the hollow have sent dispatches to me , requesting assistance , and now , just this very moment , i have chosen you .	chosen me ?
these `` methods '' of yours ... there has been no practical application .	not for lack of trying .
just so . granted . and so you take your experimentations to sleepy hollow and catch the murderer who has tainted the place . bring him here to face our good justice . will you do this for me ?	i shall , gladly .
master crane , sir . i 'm glad we have time alone . you 've been told plenty about the horseman , i 'm certain .	more than enough , actually . i beg you , no more , please .
tell me something . what becomes of young masbath ?	van ripper and his wife agreed to take him . they have children and a good home and good land .
the widow windsor .	is that all you say ? look at her .
well , constable ... are you aware ... to be honest , you are not what we expected . we sent for the militia .	the militia ?
the van garretts died first ; a man and his son , survived by a wife and two infants . and the widow windsor was next ...	and now jonathan masbath .
why would he flee this direction , with so much open ground to cross before he reached cover ?	he would not have gone into the western woods . no sane man would .
... found the body this morning . you do believe now , do n't you ?	believe ?
what is that you wear ?	my talisman . it will , protect against the horseman if i show a brave face . but , i can not run . if i run in fear , it is worthless .
not more than a year ago , a mob hung a man for stealing a horse . for stealing a horse ! and , you dig up our dead .	are you saying i should be frightened ? is this a message passed on from clergyman steenwyck ?
we are farmers here , not lawyers or bankers , or even constables . every penny we earn comes from what we send down the hudson .	i know it .
listen to what you say ... .	no , you listen ! you may think we are a pack of superstitious dullards ...
i am not here for revenge . i am here to bring justice .	whatever . you still need a second to tend to your things .
i manage fine alone .	i deserve to help you . do n't you see how much this means ? my father ... he ... he was a good man ...
young masbath , i am sorry for your loss . it is a great and sad tragedy . however ... i can not be the one to look after you now .	i did not ask you to , did i ?
what is the common thread between these victims ?	i 'm sure i do n't know .
the lenape indian had much to tell once i opened his mouth .	how could he ?
where are we going ?	up .
what is it ?	it 's payment day . loan monies are given to baltus the last day each month . almost everyone borrows ... for tools or to hire workers .
out there . what do you see ?	the western woods .
are you familiar with magnets ?	what kind of nuts ?
it 's spectacular .	yes ... i suppose it is . keep it .
no , i could n't ...	i have others . all i need is this .
thank you .	now , hold the bowl steady . back to business .
if the western woods are truly the devil 's glen , we will see for ourselves .	father said witches live there .
what is it ?	listen .
i hear nothing .	no crickets or cicadas calling . no bird songs .
we are leaving .	what happened ?
follow the indian trail to where the sun dies . to the tree of the dead . maybe we passed it by .	how could something named `` the tree of the dead '' fail to draw attention ?
we should not go much further in this murk .	should we go back ?
what does it mean ... climb down to the horseman 's soulless place ?	`` let loose his silent shrieking . '' who knows , till we work at it ? i admit not being anxious to find out . `` he who holds the horseman 's desire will guide his reaping hand . '' whatever the horseman 's desire is , other than extinguishing lives .
if the crone 's wound bled hard , that means she was not killed by the hessian . someone only tried to make it look that way .	you grow sharper by the minute , little man . it boggles my mind , but i begin to prefer your company over all others .
well ... i 'm one of the few people who likes you .	true enough .
then , who murdered the old crone ? and why ?	good questions , deserving answers , of which we are in short supply .
what is it ?	stay back .
must be some sort of gateway . but , why this place ... ?	we should go .
someone left last night . looked like they headed to the square , but i lost them in the forest .	man or woman ?
all i saw was their lantern .	business , best hidden is hidden best at night .
if someone has the horseman 's skull ... if they control the horseman , then why have n't they sent him for your head yet ?	because , i serve a fine purpose alive . it is perfection for our murderer if i return to new york city with nothing more than tales of a galloping ghoul . we must uncover the reason these victims were targeted . what was taken from them ... other than their lives ? who benefits by their deaths ?
what good is this ?	to discover what might have been taken from those who died , it will help to know what was there that could be taken in the first place .
my father had farm land . it was the only thing we owned of any value .	and it now belongs to you , according to baltus . i heard him say it .
only the heirs were killed . proof that the horseman slaughters by assignment .	but , if the farm is not mine , who stole it away ?
no one yet , far as i can tell . it has gone intestate .	in test ... what ?
intestate . your farm ... all the farms ... they belong to no one .	what does it mean ?
often in such cases , property which has gone intestate legally passes to whomever the deceased was indebted to . and , who in this town is owed a great many debts ?	baltus van tassel .
did your father take a loan ?	yes . i rode with him on payment days .
there is no masbath here . my father 's loan papers are missing .	there are none for magistrate philipse either . `` paasch , james '' `` pieter , thomas '' `` pos , william . ''
i was getting worried . who was it ?	lady van tassel .
what was she doing ?	something i really wish i had not seen . never mind it . did you find the victims ' loan agreements ?
there are no other doors . this is as far as she could have gone .	it is nothing . she comes to read books , so her father will not find her . it is absolutely nothing .
what books ?	fiction plays and novels . baltus does not approve . now , come . it may not be long before lady van tassel returns .
what now ? where is she ?	things have become complicated . katrina is at the mill . ride ahead , find her and bring her to meet me outside the church . find her at all costs . quickly .
she 's the one who controlled the horseman , is n't she , sir ? sir ?	i need time for thinking . without you hanging on my coattails for a change .
wo n't you change your mind , sir ? what can i say to convince you ?	nothing . to hell with this place and all the people here .
why ... why are you like this ?	you do not know all that has happened . you can not understand .
this is farewell .	take me with you . there 's nothing left for me here .
climb up !	lady van tassel ...
what can we do ?	take the reins .
what now ?	i doubt that 's the end .
how are you ?	tired .
forgive me , i did n't know .	i ... i am looking for baltus van tassel .
did they tell ? it is something in the air so that dreams come to everyone . according to the elders , an indian prophet held powwows here before the land was taken , and spells cast then still linger to this day .	do you often make a habit of sitting on strange men 's beds ?
you are horribly old-fashioned , are n't you ?	feel free to form your own opinion . though it appears you already have .
well , i intended to apologize for the behavior of my friend brom van brunt , but it seems i 've made matters worse . i 'll leave you to your business .	excuse me ... i should apologize . i , um ... i ... have no great love of ...
other people ?	small talk .
is it me , or are you this nervous around all women ?	perhaps it is because your suitor 's hands were recently very nearly wrapped around my throat .
my suitor ?	the massive fellow ... brom . for someone you call `` friend , '' he misplaces a good portion of jealousy .
he has proposed to me twice .	which may explain his temperament . to have asked twice means the answer was `` no '' at least once .
i 've read a great deal about your new york city . do be a dear and tell me all about it . sounds like an extraordinary place to live a life .	extra ordinary , yes . but first , you tell me about the headless horseman .
not all think it is the horseman . many say witches come from the western woods to steal skulls for their cauldrons . some believe a person in this very town kneels before lucifer , offering death as tribute . and , still others believe none of it .	are you so superstitious ?
to call a person superstitious is to imply they fear magic , but not all magic is black .	there is no such thing as magic .
really ? then ... what is your rebuttal to those romantic poets claiming proof of magic in a rose at full bloom , or even in a teardrop ?	poets have silly notions about plants and bodily secretions .
you do not disturb me . please stay . having trouble sleeping ?	may i ask ... why do you cover your book that way ?
you pay great attention to small things . i hide these as i hide all my books . father would not approve , lest it were the bible .	i , um ... i have something to show you , if you have a moment .
these scars . how did you get them ?	i have had them since childhood . i can not remember what from .
here it is . a bird on one side . his cage on the other . now , stare at it . the bird seems to be in his cage .	yes , he does . may i try ?
he only appears to be inside the cage . the point being ...	you made this , and the drawings ?
yes , but listen . the illusion is easily explained . the eye retains each image , till they combine . and yet , some would call this toy magic .	do n't you see why ? look closely a moment . put your intellect aside . ca n't you see what is inexplicable ?
oh , you are hopeless . may i keep it at least ?	if you want . but ...
thank you . no . here ...	i insist that you have it .
very well . but , it will only sit gathering dust .	that would be a pity . those words might show you something you 've never seen before .
you promised justice .	if these are the random stalkings of a monster , what good am i ?
people have put their trust in you .	they have done nothing of the sort .
why would you do such a thing ?	no stone may be left unturned . it may appear harsh ...
i have misjudged you i think . i did not imagine you were so cruel .	you are not regarding it in full . the widow windsor had been run through by a sword . i followed the bloodless wound , a wound whose path i could not comprehend till i had seen the horseman with my own eyes .
what are you on about ?	the child she carried was eight months grown at least ... near to birthing . the sword had pierced its tiny heart exactly .
must i hear this ?	there was no blind stabbing . this singular thrust found its target omnipotently , as if the horseman made certain the unborn child died with its mother .
and this gives worth to butchery ?	it was not butchery .
what is it then ? scientific method ? how can any of this matter in the slightest ?	i have no solution for its meaning yet , but i could not just ignore it .
take a lesson from young masbath 's desires , ichabod crane . he follows with you to avenge his father 's death . that i understand . but , what do you want ?	to avenge his father , and the others .
you falter with your answer because you strive without putting the whole of your heart into it . ca n't you see ? you 'll bring dignity to the dead even if you have to chop them into little pieces to do it .	if it had been surgery on a living person , done to save that person 's life , you would not question it . not for a moment . so , let me be the first to tell you , dear girl ... on the other side of these sheltering mountains , a whole world has advanced beyond such plebeian thinking as yours . and someday , no matter how much you fear it , that world will come to roust sleepy hollow out of its slumber .
allow me some time . i have spent every hour in the company of others . i need to be alone .	what troubles you ?
the things i said to you before ... i was wrong to say them .	no , actually , you were not . every word you spoke had truth in it .
lady van tassel ... she is your stepmother , is n't she ? she bears so little resemblance .	what ?
she is not your birth mother , is she ?	no , but ... why do you ask that ?
what happened to your mother ? is she still alive ?	she died . her lungs were diseased ... two years ago . what is this about ?
memories have come back . i had them forgotten , and wish i could forget them again ... but they are here now . lord , how i hate this place .	if you want me to go , i will . do you want me to leave ?
it is only me .	katrina . why do you follow ?
i apologize if i worried you .	a woman should not be out alone in these woods .
blood .	what did you say ?
what are you doing ?	just ... keep where you are .
my god ... what has happened ?	he ... he tries to take the heads ... they will not pass .
why is it every grave i open holds a new mystery inside ?	the skull is gone .
what ... what are you doing ... ?	i 'm drawing bad blood from the wound .
what is so urgent ?	come with me .
i have been reading your journal . i 'm sorry . i found it too fascinating to resist . i rode to catch up with you at the notary , out of curiosity . before i found you though , i overheard what you were said .	it was you there ?
when ... when you spoke father 's name along with accusations , i could not believe it . i had to hide these ... at least till i could confront him myself .	and , what did he say ?
he did not do these things . if you knew him , you would realize ...	what did he say , katrina ?
i have not been able to face him yet .	the loans give the land to your father . it does not matter survivors are still on their farms . they could be thrown off ... tomorrow ... a year from now .
yes , i have seen that , and i told you why i hid them .	what would you have me believe ?
if you think i am behind this , say it .	the name van tassel is blackened . you share that name .
katrina ...	speak the words , constable . what is stopping you ? what has happened to your ability to transcend sentimentality ?
where are we going ?	i do not know . away .
the church .	he moves too fast .
what was that ?	his horse .
ichabod ...	keep climbing . i will follow ...
quickly , close it .	no . get to the crest of the roof and be ready to jump .
the blades will carry us to the ground . face front and wait for me .	i ... i ca n't do this .
you said yourself . what mere man could have downed the belltower ?	it is a prime tenet of science , philipse , that because one thing appears improbable does not mean you embrace the utterly fantastical .
returning to the western woods ?	yes , actually .
use caution .	do you know ... i think those are the first words i have heard from you my entire time here .
excuse me , lady van tassel ... katrina is not in her room .	no . she has gone out .
where ?	she has taken the last of our grain to be milled . you do have a background in the medical arts , do n't you , constable ?
it appears well . it has already clotted .	look closer . do you have anything to clean it with ?
i know you saw me .	what ... ?
you can not kill what is already dead .	let her go !
van ripper . can you show where the body lay ?	i can show exactly .
here ... in front of this oak , facing north . horrible ...	to the best of your recollection , where did the open wound fall ?
there was not much blood , was there ?	i did n't see none .
van ripper , turn the coach about !	what did you say ?
van ripper ... do you have a gun ?	yes . here ...
pardon . you did not answer when i knocked . are we intruding ?	you are from the hollow ?
the lenape who lived in these woods ... do you know him ? the redman ? i should tell you ... he has been murdered .	leave me . you are not welcome here .
i hear him . he rides to the hollow and back .	the horseman . yes .
can you help ?	you want to see into the nether world ... i can show you . whatever you see , do not move or speak . i will hold him .
what ... what are you doing ?	close your mouth ! keep silent .
lay still , ichabod . do not move .	doctor , he is awake .
you ... you are alive .	am i ? or , are you and young masbath dead along with me ?
he rides tonight .	father saw you die .
imagine my surprise , finding him on a liason with a common servant . a girl who had apparently become his secret love .	no one will believe your lies , whore .
go home .	may i see my mother ?
you do not want to be here . go home to your father .	she did not do it ... please listen ...
she is guilty .	no , sir , please ... she is innocent ...
she has confessed .	no .
all right then , i 'll see y'all later . karl you done a good day 's work . they right about you . scooter , he 's gon na knock you out of a job if you 're not careful . i 'll see you tomorrow .	wait up , i 'll leave with you and lock up .
scooter , did i tell about the two old boys pissin ' off the bridge ?	i ca n't remember .
there was these two old boys hung their peckers off of a bridge to piss , one old boy from california and one old boy from arkansas . old boy from california says , `` boy this water 's cold . '' old boy from arkansas says `` yeah , and it 's deep too . '' get it ? that 's a goodun .	yeah , that 's a goodun . i believe you did tell me that one before . i 've heard that a bunch . long time ago .
i can go . you do n't have to . you do n't never go .	goddamnit , scooter , come on . pardon my language , ma'am .
thank ye .	now it 's minimal wage and there ai n't nothin ' but a army cot and a toilet back there .
they say you 're a whiz on fixin ' lawn mowers and things .	i 've tinkered around on 'em a little bit .
we order from dairy queen at noontime usually . we can buy your lunch till you get on your feet a little .	i like them french-fried potaters .
i do n't reckon .	if it works out and all , maybe we 'll get you a key so you can get out at night if you need to . see you later .
yeah , they 's good all right .	you got any money ?
they give me fifty dollars when they turned me loose . i spent up some of it on ridin ' the bus and eatin ' french-fried potaters .	well , i 'm gon na pay you today for this comin ' week , so you 'll have some walkin ' around money . when you get off this evenin ' you better go buy some toothpaste and cleanin ' up supplies to have back there . some hard candy and some magazines . somethin ' to keep you busy at night .
all right then .	i 'll let you off while it 's still daylight .
now , karl , you sure you want to go stay with these folks ? you 're welcome to keep on stayin here . it 's workin ' out real good .	that boy wants me to .
all right then . i 'll see you bright and early . how you comin ' along on that garden tiller ?	i fixed it . hit 's a workin ' pretty good .
hit ai n't got no gas in it .	see there . thinks of the simplest thing first .
thank ye .	scooter , let 's me and you go over to dairy queen and pick up a few things for lunchtime .
hey jerry , how it 's goin ' . good to see you . been a long time .	good to see you , bill . how 's everybody doin ' ?
aw , pretty good . kids are drivin ' me crazy and phyliss is gon na put me in the poorhouse . ca n't complain other than that . would n't do any good if i did . do you know scooter , jerry ?	no , do n't guess i do . scooter , good to meet you . this is him , the one i talked to you about on the phone . now like i said , i 'll understand if you get nervous about it . i 'm not gon na lie to you now , he did get in that trouble but then he was real young .
do n't look much like he could . you say he can fix a small engine like nobody 's bidness .	he 's a regular whiz at it . that 's all he did when he was a kid .
that old man of his still livin ' over there on clark street i believe .	he wo n't have anything to do with him . now you say it 's all right for him to stay out here in the back ?
he wo n't steal . i 'm tellin ' you he 's a pretty good ol ' boy . keeps to himself .	well , i 've got a roomful of work for him to do . ca n't get scooter to do any of it .
karl , come over here . i want you to meet your new boss . this is bill cox , runs this place . says you can work here and stay in the back .	good to know you , karl .
how 'bout you , jerry .	how are you , bill ?
doin ' pretty good . got a sick tiller here . what 's got you down this way ?	just thought i 'd check on karl and see if everything 's working out .
well , he 's pretty quiet . except for them rackets and breathin ' things he does . ai n't threatened me with a killin ' or anything . but boy you could n't of been more right about him fixin ' things . that son of a bitch is a regular eli whitney on a lawnmower . loves french fries . eats four larges and do n't even so much as belch . i 'm proud to have him .	is him stayin ' here workin ' out ?
he 's gone to stayin ' over with that wheatley boy and his mama in their garage . i think that little boy adopted him damn near like a mascot . but he 's got a key here to come and go as he pleases . everything 's worked out good .	can i see him ?
i 'll see you , bill .	okay , stop back by . do n't worry about your boy here , he 's doin ' good .

... on the third day i washed her . she was n't very clean . i got all the right spots . she was the first one i ever kept for any length of time , you see i get bored easily , i have a short attention span . i ca n't say she enjoyed her stay , although the washcloth in her mouth held in place by good duct tape kept any complaints to a minimum . i do n't really like people who talk a lot . i like to do the talking . i guess that 's why i 'm so fond of you . you 're so easygoing , although i do sense a little tension in you sometimes . by the way , how was it out there ? did you have any fun ? make any new acquaintances ? tell me what it was like .	they was a boy . we made friends .
i bet you did . i was never bent that way . i 'm bent the other way . so , you liked it out there in the world .	it 's too big .
well , it 's not too big in here , is it ? i feel very generous today . i feel like listening . i 'm sure you have plenty to tell me . and please bore me with the details . ) come on karl , who did you kill ? was it the boy ?	do n't say nothin ' about that boy .

doyle , you 're awful . you should n't be that way .	i ai n't sayin ' it 's right . i 'm just tellin ' the truth . what was he in the nuthouse for ?
he 's just mentally retarded , i guess .	he had of went nuts and did somethin ' . they do n't put you in there for just bein ' a retard . they 's retards all over the place that ai n't in the nuthouse . do you know , frank ?
yeah , that 's right , frank , you better ask him . i mean , do n't hurt his feelin 's or anything , but it would be good to know . i 'm sure it 's nothin ' . he seems real sweet .	you sure are hung up on people bein ' sweet . speakin ' of which , where 's your girlfriend ? i thought he was comin ' by here for something .

well , honey , i do n't guess i give a shit . i ai n't here half the time anyway . if you want a retard livin ' in the garage , i do n't guess i care . i 've got a good tool box and socket set out there i do n't want stol 'd . i guess i could take it home with me .	he 's real honest . he would n't steal nothin ' .
now son , i wad n't talkin ' to you , was i ? was i ?	no sir .

i want to watch t.v .	yeah , honey , let the kid watch t.v . hell , let 's all watch t.v . like a family till your retarded friend and your homosexual friend gets here .
come on , karl , let 's go out to the garage .	goddamnit , i 'm talkin ' to the man . you set right there , karl .
stop it , doyle !	you be quiet , frank , we 're talkin ' . the adults are talkin ' . were you in the lockup for cuttin ' somebody up with a hatchet ?
stop it , doyle ! do n't talk about daddy , you hear me !	do n't talk about daddy . y'all go on to the garage and let me be .
what have you got to be nervous about ? you 're a damn kid . you ai n't got any bills to pay or bidness to run or old lady to stay on your ass all the time .	i get nervous , that 's all i know .
last time you got mad and run morris and them off and said to stay away from here .	that ai n't none of your damn bidness . besides that 's the way friends do one another . fuck it , i 'm gon na go call 'em . honey , find my guitar , i think it 's out there in the garage with that loony tune .
okay , i 'll leave and sober up . everything 's botherin ' me , that 's all . i 'm hurtin ' linda . i love you .	i hate you !
now here 's the deal . now that i 'm gon na throw my entire life away doin ' what i want to come live here with y'all , we have to get a few things straight . see , frank , me and you mama would n't have any problems if it wad n't for you . we 'd never have a bad word between us . but since you do exist , if i 'm gon na be here as the head of the household , we 'll have to live by my rules . and my rules are you do n't speak unless you 're spoken to . stay out of my way and do what a regular kid does . you 're a weird little shit . i do n't get you . so wake up . face what they call reality . we 're gon na be a family now . and it 's my family . i 'll be payin ' the bills so you got me . but i ai n't your daddy . you just treat me like i am . i 'm the boss , okay . and the other thing is your friend karl has to go . we ca n't have a normal family with him livin ' in the garage and comin ' in the bedroom at four in the mornin ' with hammers and shit . see ?	karl can stay if he wants to . mama said --
sure , i guess .	do n't rush ever'body , honey .
hey , vaughan , you know what i heard ? i heard you been puttin ' it to albert sellers that works over at the funeral home .	i know albert . we 're friends .
i heard you was more than friends . i heard dick rivers caught y'all all bowed up and goin ' at it in the same room with poor , little , old mizz ogletree and her dead as a doornail layed out on a gurney .	that 's ridiculous . that 's just a total lie .
you like that vaughan ?	sure . it sounded like a number one tune all right .
i 'd better go on home now , it 's late . i have to work tomorrow .	come on , do n't be a pussy . everybody has to work .
are you sure you can drive ? you 've really had a lot of alcohol .	shhhh ! this is the national anthem .
i bet you like sittin ' between two men in a dual wheel truck do n't you ?	oh , yeah , i 'm thrilled .
you got that shit right .	what exactly do you mean by that ? i do n't understand .
i do n't really understand the meaning of the words .	if y'all do n't shut up i 'm gon na go out of my mind . and plus you 're liable to bust a spring in karl 's head . he 's already off balance .
we do n't have a goddamn band ! y'all just shut the fuck up ! we do n't need no practicin ' or managers cause we ai n't no fuckin ' band ! morris ai n't no genius and the rest of you are just losers . am i the only one sane human bein ' around here ? just get the hell out of my house and do n't come back !	it 's not your house , doyle , it 's linda 's .
doyle , do n't you lay one hand on her .	that 's funny . you go to bed and take snot nose with you .
i 'm a witness . i heard you threaten her life .	i thought i told you to keep out !
what 's in your bag ?	this and that . toothpaste and whatnot .
what 's all them books ?	different ones . the bible 's one of 'em .
you believe in the bible ?	a good deal of it , i reckon . ca n't understand all of it .
i ai n't never used no hatchet that i remember .	you 're just crazy in a retarded kind of way then . it would n't matter to me if you did do violence on somebody 'cause i ai n't afraid of shit . you think i 'm afraid for you to stay here . you 're just a humped over retard it looks like to me . not really , i 'm just jokin ' with you . welcome to our humble home , buddy . frank needs all the friends he can get . frank 's a real weak little kid . his daddy taught him how to be a pussy .
on the bass , give it up for terence `` one ball '' atkins . on the tambourine and lyrics morris hobbs the fuckin ' genius of the group . on drums `` the johnson . '' and last and most importantly , doyle hargraves on rhythm guitar and business affairs and the only motherfucker with a truck big enough to haul this outfit on the next world fuckin ' tour . come on , a big hand for these guys . they 're workin ' their asses off here . okay i 'd like to dedicate this next one to some very special people in our audience tonight . to my lovely female companion linda , her lovely son frank , our new boarder karl - what 's your last name karl ?	childers .
i want to be baptized .	baptized ? well , get baptized then . i do n't give a shit . call a fuckin ' preacher , goddamnit ! i ca n't baptize you .
do n't hit that boy no more .	you shut up you , fuckin ' retard . get your shit and get out of here . that was a wake-up slap , frank . remember . reality , like i said . do n't forget any bit of what i said to you and we 'll be fine .
where 's ever'body else ? you seen 'em ? i thought i told you to get the hell moved out of here anyway .	how does a feller go about gettin ' ahold of the police ?
pick up the fuckin ' phone and call 'em , i guess .	what numbers do you punch ?
i told you to get away from here , did n't i ? i 'm tryin ' to relax and look at tv . what are you doin ' with that piece of iron ? i swear to god you 're the weirdest son of a bitch i ever heard of .	i aim to kill you with it .
hey frank . you should n't be coming over here . my parents really do n't want you to .	i wanted to bring you some flowers . they 're pretty good ones .
i wanted for you to meet karl , too . he 's my new friend . but i feel like i 've always known him . i thought you should meet him .	why ? hi , karl .
he 's gon na be around a lot and i hope you are too , so ...	here give me the flowers , i 'll do something with them . thank you . now you better go . maybe i 'll see you down at the secret place one day in a week or two or something . i have a boyfriend now you know . and we 're pretty serious . he gave me a ring .
can you go there with us now ? me and karl . we could just hang out . karl has some cool books .	frank , i just like you as a friend . only at the secret place . okay ? i ca n't go there now . i 'll see you later .
but maybe just for awhile --	i 'm closing the door now . i told you , i 'll see you later .
what 's you last name ?	childers .
what are all them books ?	different ones . one 's the bible . one of 'ems a book on christmas . one of 'ems how to be a carpenter .
how come you 're carryin ' them around with you .	ai n't got nowhere to set 'em down .
do n't you live somewhere ?	i did live there in the state hospital .
why 'd you live there ?	i killed some folks quite awhile back . they said i wad n't right in the head and they put me in there in the nervous hospital instead of puttin ' me in jail .
they let you out ?	yeah .
how come ?	they told me i was well . they had to turn me loose .
are you well ?	i reckon i feel all right .
do you like to play football ?	i never was much count at it . i never did get picked out fer it .
hey there . i thought i heard somebody on the porch . was n't your name karl ?	yeah it is . your name 's frank .
yeah . what you doin ' by here ?	you told me to come by .
did you want to play ball with us ?	i ai n't no good at it . i just come by .
well , anyhow , i was just fixin ' to go see my mama down at ben 's dollar store . she 's workin ' two till eight .	all right then .
wait a minute . you want to go with me ? you can meet my mama .	i do n't want to worry your mama with company .
aw , come on . you 'll like her . she 's real nice . she 'll give us somethin ' if we ask her to . candy or somethin ' .	i was kindly needin ' to do some tradin ' . reckon they sell toothpaste ?
this is what i call my secret place 'cause i come out here when i feel like bein ' by myself . i used to come here with karen cross . she 's kind of like my girlfriend , or used to be . she says she likes jerry maroney now . but i 'm gon na get her back 'cause i love her . we used to come here and hold hands and talk and read books to each other with a flashlight . she did n't want to have anything to do with me in front of other people 'cause i do n't have any money . well , mama and me , i mean . she seemed to like me a whole lot when we were out here though . she said she loved me , too . out here . settin ' right on that stump you 're on . see , her daddy 's a dentist so they 're rich . so 's jerry maroney 's daddy . he owns the ice plant . was your folks well off ?	naw . did n't have too much . enough to scrape by on , i reckon .
they still around , your folks ?	my mother 's dead . my daddy 's s'posed to be around still . he do n't want to have nothin ' to do with me though .
how do you know ?	he never did want to . i figure he ai n't changed his mind much .
how did your mama die ?	you do n't need to know all of that . you 're just a boy . you need to think about good thoughts while you 're still a boy . they 'll be plenty of time for the other .
i 've had a lot of bad thoughts since my daddy died . sometimes i wish i was still real little and he was still here . my mama 's real good , but i wish i had both of 'em . when we went to memphis one time in the car , it was rainin ' so hard we could n't see the road . but i wad n't scared because i thought as long as daddy was drivin ' nothin ' could happen to us . i feel that way about mama now . mama has a boyfriend now . his name is doyle hargraves . he works construction so he makes a pretty good livin ' . he still do n't help mama out with any money though . he ai n't no good . he 's mean to her . he do n't like me at all . mama says it 's because he 's jealous i belong to my daddy instead of him . he stays with us all night sometimes , but he 's got his own house . somebody told me it 's so he can still have other girlfriends . i like it on the nights when he ai n't at our house . i 'm not so nervous then .	how come her to keep bein ' girlfriends and all with him if he 's mean to her ?
karl . you know when i said daddy got hit by a train .	yeah , i remember you a-tellin ' me that .
it ai n't the truth . he shot hisself with a shotgun on purpose .	why did he do that , reckon .
'cause he did n't have enough money to take care of us the way he wanted to . that 's what the letter said . he got laid off from work and had to just work odd jobs . i thought he took care of us fine . karl , did you really kill somebody ?	yeah , i did .
who did you kill ?	two people .
were they bad people ?	i thought they was .
maybe they needed it .	i growed up and got taught it ai n't right to kill nobody .
i 'd like to kill that son of a bitch . i hate him .	you ort not to talk that way . you 're just a boy .
well , i hate him .	he ort not to talk that away to you neither . he ai n't no count . he 's mean to you and your mama . yore mama and that feller that 's carryin ' me to get somethin ' d'eat 's gon na be back here directly .
will you stay here with us for a long time ?	i reckon if you want me to . i got some of that potted meat and sodie crackers left over if you want some .
i do n't see how you can eat that stuff with all those insides it 's made out of .	i reckon it tastes pretty good to me .
i like the way you talk .	i like the way you talk .
hey karl , you off work ?	yeah .
where 'd you get them flowers ?	that gal that made employee of the month give 'em to me for awalkin ' with her .
i was goin ' to the secret place . i borried one of your books to take down there . you ai n't mad , are you ?	naw . you can look at all my books you want to .
it 's name 's a christmas carol .	that 's than un on christmas i was tellin ' you about .
you want to go with me ?	yeah .
i 'm gettin ' tired of readin ' for a while .	all right then .
boy , folks sure had it rough back a long time ago , did n't they ?	yeah , i reckon they did . hit like to tore me up when i read about that pore little cripple boy .
yeah , me too . that was nice of that woman to give you them flowers .	hit was right thoughty of her .
i was wantin ' to ask you somethin ' .	all right then .
you know that girl i told you about . the one i love .	yeah , i recollect it .
would you go see her with me ? i kind of thought i might take her some flowers like that woman done you .	if you want me to .
i ai n't got no money to get 'em with but i bet vaughan will let me have some of them flowers at the store .	i bet he will . i got a little money if he do n't . i 'll get 'em for ye .
i usually get run off by her mama or daddy if they 're home . reckon why they do n't like me ?	they ort to . you 're a good boy .
just 'cause i 'm not rich do n't mean i do n't love her .	naw .
and i do n't try to touch her . you know , in a bad way . foolin ' around , sex and all .	that 's real good . you ort not to if ye ai n't married to somebody . bible tells you that much . hit tells some things that do n't seem right too , i reckon . i guess a feller ort to foller it close as he can , though . you do n't touch yourself , do you ?
what do you mean ?	pull on your works . your privates .
oh , jackin ' off ?	yes sir . you ort not know that language .
i did n't know till here while back a year or two ago when i spent the night with ronnie smart one time . he said just tug on your peter and think about your mama . i tried it , but i felt funny thinkin ' about my mama . so , i switched over to thinkin ' about his mama and then what he told me would happen , happened . it sure tingles , do n't it ?	you ort not to pull on yourself that away .
i kind of like you tellin ' me what to do and not to do . just like my daddy . i did n't mind him tellin ' me . i hate doyle to tell me what to do . mama said the only way to ever get away from him is for him to get away from us . that we ca n't leave him or he 'll try and hurt her .	he ai n't no count .
you do n't seem like a daddy . you seem like a brother . wonder what makes you like somebody right off when you do n't even know 'em like what happened with me and you .	i do n't reckon i know .
and then some people you do n't like right off . it 's funny . you know why i want you to play ball with me ?	naw .
'cause it 's fun . it do n't matter if you ai n't no good . it takes your mind off of everything else while you 're doin ' it . when you run real fast tryin ' to make a touchdown you do n't think about anything else . i ai n't no good , but my daddy always said he was proud of me when i threw a ball or ran with it . did you have any brothers and sisters growin ' up to play with ?	i had one there for little bit . hit did n't get old enough to play with .
why not ? it died ?	yeah .
why ?	hit was borned a little too early on . my mother and father made hit come too early some way or other . i reckon they changed their mind about havin ' another'n . i was about six or eight year old then and they did n't care too much for me so i reckon they did n't need somethin ' else to worry 'em with .
so it died when it come out ?	my daddy come to the shed out back and got me and said throw this here away and handed me a towel with somethin ' in it . i went for the trash barrel there and opened up the towel to see 'cause they was a noise and somethin ' movin ' in it . hit was bloody-like around that towel . hit was a little ol ' bitty baby , no bigger than a squirrel .
it was alive ?	yes sir . right then it was .
a boy or girl ?	a little ol ' boy .
you threw it in a trash barrel ?	i did n't feel right about doin ' that . i takened a shoe box from there in the shed and emptied out some screwdrivers and nuts and warshers from it and put the little feller in that and buried him in the corner of the yard there . that seemed more proper to me , i reckon .
it was still alive when you buried it ?	i heared it cryin ' a little through that box .
that do n't seem right . it seems like you should have kept him alive and took care of him if he was your brother .	i wad n't but six or eight . i reckon i did n't know what to do . i did n't know how to care for no baby . mama and daddy did n't want him . they learned me to do what they told me to . these days i figure it might of been best to give him right back to the good lord right off the bat anyhow .
that makes me feel real sad . could n't you have done somethin ' , karl ? i would have . i wish i would of had him . he 'd be here right now . livin ' .	hits been hard thinkin ' about it . they ai n't a day goes by i do n't think about it . i kindly have a picture of it up in my head that i see . hit makes me sad , too . i have bad thoughts on it . i wished they was somethin ' i could of did , too . should n't no bad things happen to childern . all the ol ' bad things ort to be saved up for folks that 's growed up , the way i see it . i should n't of told you about that . a boy ort not hear about such things . it just kindly come out .
i did n't mean to say anything bad about you . i know you 're good . you did n't mean no harm . did you ever think about killin ' yourself on purpose like my daddy did ?	i 've studied about it . the bible says not to or you end up goin ' to hades . some folks calls it hell , i call it hades .
bible says the same thing about killin ' others , too .	yes sir , i reckon it does .
she said she 'd see me later . that 's kinda good , right ?	i reckon .
what you readin ' ?	readin ' on this book on how to work carpentry . i aim to learn how to build things out of wood one of these times . i 've always been partial to wood buildin 's and cabinets and whatnot . these drawin 's they got here do n't make no sense to me so far . you seem like yore tails a'draggin ' a might . you got somethin ' wrong with ye ?
seems like doyle 's wormed his way back in . mama said he 's stayin ' over tonight and he 's talkin ' about movin ' in for good . we ai n't ever gon na be happy . we 'll always be nervous , wo n't we karl ?	i do n't reckon i know . i ai n't found no way yet and i 'm three or four times as old as you . might be that 's just the way folks is .
i feel sad about karen cross , too . i just make like to myself she loves me . i know better , though . it just feels good to me when i imagine it .	make believin ' always made me feel good too from time to time .
bill cox is goin ' to a funeral for a mister turner tomorrow and a closin ' up shop early .	is that right ?
i 'll play ball with ye . i reckon if neither one of us is no count it wo n't make no difference .	you will ? for sure ?
yeah .	we 'll be on teams , me and you ?
way to go , karl . we got a touchdown . that was a good lateral , man . that was just like the wishbone .	i dern near had me a touchdown till them boys got a-hold of me there so i figured i better give it off to you . i seen you over there follerin ' me .
i know you could of scored them three touchdowns by yourself instead of throwing 'em over to me .	them boys was tryin ' to pull me down pretty hard .
it do n't matter to me about us losin ' does it to you ?	no sir .
it was fun , anyhow .	i wad n't thinkin ' about nothin ' else just like you told me i 'd do .
can we play ever ' saturday ?	if i ai n't too stove up . i ai n't like you . i 'm old and give out . i 'm proud of ye .
yeah , i guess .	yes ma'am . i like a fried chicken leg .
hey , karl . how 'd you know to come out here ?	i knowed you 'd be here . what are you a-doin ' digging with that stob ?
just diggin ' . i ai n't ever gon na be happy now . not with that son of a bitch movin ' in for good . i wish me and you and mama could just run away . but she said he would find us wherever we went . he 's crazy . sometimes i think it would of been better if i wad n't ever born .	i 'm glad of it you was borned . i reckon i ai n't gon na be there in the garage no more .
you have to karl . you have to look out for me . you do n't let that son of a bitch run you off .	you 're just a boy . you ort not to use that sort of language .
karl , i ai n't tryin ' to say nothin ' bad about you , but why do n't you stop doyle when he gets that away ? you 're older than him . you 're strong , too . my daddy would n't let him do that to me and mama .	that feller 's a whole sight meaner than me . he 'd just whup the tar out of me .
yeah , i guess so . i 'm real tired , you know that . a kid my age should n't be tired of things .	i 'm tired , too , frank . if i ai n't around no more , it do n't mean i do n't care fer ye . i care for ye a good deal . i care for you more than anybody they is . we made friends right off the bat .
i care for you , too . but you 'll be around , do n't say that .	hit do n't make no difference where i was to be . we 'll always be friends . there ai n't no way to stop that . i aim for you to have these books .
maybe you can make more sense out of them than i can . i made you a little old book marker and stuck it in that book on christmas .	you do n't want to give away all your books .
i aim fer you to have 'em .	man . thanks . you know when you get a feelin ' and you do n't know why ?
yes sir .	i 've got a feelin ' today .
reckon what kind of a feelin ' ?	like something different . i do n't know . you 're leavin ' ai n't you , karl ?
will ye do somethin ' for me if i ast you to ?	you know i would . whatever you want .
do n't go home tonight and stay with that doyle . he 's got it in for ye tonight . i got me a feelin ' , too . feels like to me you ort not be there in that house with him liquored up and mean . ye mama neither . when you get up from here , i want you to go to that feller 's house . your mama 's friend . i want you to give me your word on it .	okay . i give you my word . is ever'thing gon na be okay ? are you all right ?
ever'thing 's okay , boy . i kindly want to put my arm around ye for a minute and then i 'm gon na go on and leave here .	okay .
hey , mama . hey , vaughan .	hey , sweetheart . what you up to ?
oh , that 's karl . i met him at the laundrymat . karl , this is my mama . and vaughan , vaughan 's the manager . he lets mama off any time she feels like it 'cause they 're best friends .	nice to meet you , karl .
hey karl , guess what . mama said you can stay with us . out in the garage . our car wo n't fit in there anyway . it 's real neat .	frank told me about your situation . and frank loves company . you know , especially after his daddy passed and all . there ai n't no sense in you stayin ' in that old greasy shop . he 's mentally retarded , poor thing .
maybe you and karl want to go with us ?	naw , i do n't want to . me and karl got things we need to do .
how come karl wo n't eat here with us ?	i do n't know . he just said he 'd eat out there .
i sure like the way he talks . it sounds like a race car motor idlin ' . it makes me not be nervous .	i 'm glad of it , honey .
karl , now listen , there 's gon na be a party tonight here at the house . doyle 's invited his music-playin ' buddies over to make a bunch of racket out on the patio .	they ai n't even no good . the only one can play is randy horsefeathers . he claims he 's an indian . his real name 's randy collins and he works at the feed mill . he can at least play guitar .
he 's no more an indian than i am though . anyhow , doyle 's gon na try and tease you and be mean to you to show off to his friends . just like he does to frank and me sometimes . you just ignore it . or stay out here away from 'em if he 'll let you . he 's an okay guy till he gets drunk but tonight he 'll get drunk . i guarantee it .	he ai n't ever okay to me .
you all right , mama ?	i 'm fine , honey . let 's just try and forget about tonight .
we do n't need to think bad thoughts , do we mama ?	no , honey , we do n't . i 'll make some coffee and start cleanin ' up this mess . karl , you want some coffee , huh ?
what are you doin ' up again , frank ? you need to get a little sleep .	did vaughan go home ?
yeah , he has to go to work in a little while . i do too .	did karl go to bed ?
i guess . he went to the garage . poor thing , he 's probably never seen such a crazy mess . he probably wants to go back and live in mr. cox 's shop .	i bet he do n't . karl likes me .
i know he does .	mama ?
huh ?	is everything gon na be all right someday ? i just stay nervous all the time just about .
yeah , honey , someday everything 's gon na be all right .	doyle would n't really kill you , would he ?
i promise we 're gon na get away from him . the time has to be right , that 's all . i 'd rather him get tired of me and leave me . then he would n't want to hurt me . he would n't care then . we 'll be fine . i promise . you go to bed now . i love you .	i love you , too , mama .
well , at least he 's tryin ' . but who knows for how long .	he 's lyin ' mama . he ai n't gon na do better .
i know honey . just remember what i said , we 'll bide our time . you just steer clear of him as much as you can . doyle 's had a real hard life . it 's just about run him crazy i think .	we 've had a real hard life , too , mama .
yes ma'am , i reckon .	well , when you like pricing items as much as i do , i guess it 's just bound to happen sooner or later .
i like walkin ' quite a bit from time to time .	i stay on my feet all the time at work . i just ca n't find shoes that 's comfortable .
you walk fast , do n't you ?	i reckon .
these is the worst shoes i own for walkin ' . how far did you want to go ?	i ai n't really thought about it too much i do n't reckon .
a blister shore can hurt .	yeah .
flowers is pretty . i 've always thought that .	me , too .
i 'm ye boy .	i ai n't got no boy .
i 'm ye oldest boy name karl .	i ai n't got no boy .
that grass out in the yard 's all growed up . i figured i might cut it fer ye .	i told you , i ai n't got no boy , now get on out from here and let me be .
i reckon i 'm gon na have to get used to looking at pretty people .	yes , i guess you are .
i reckon i 'm gon na have to get used to them lookin ' at me , too .	you better go get your things .
i ai n't got nothing but them books .	you better go get 'em .
karl , what in the world are you doing here ?	i want to come back and stay here .
well , you ca n't do that . you 're a free man . you 've been let out to do as you please .	i reckon i do n't care nothin ' about bein ' a free man . i do n't know how to go about it .
well , you have to learn . it 'll take some time . do n't you know anybody down there to help you out ?	naw .
your daddy 's still livin ' down there from what you told me . i guess he would n't help you any , would he ? i was n't thinking . you do n't know anybody ?	naw . never did know too much of nobody . not to he'p me out anyway .
listen , karl , the truth is i do n't know where they expect you to go or what they expect you to do . if it was up to me , i 'd let you stay here if that 's what you wanted . i 'm just doin ' my job . you follow me ? listen , i know an old boy that runs a fix-it shop deal down in millsburg . he used to go to church with me . you 're good workin ' on small engines and things . if i put my neck out for you with him , will you work at it if he 'll hire you ?	i 'm pretty handy i reckon on lawn mowers and whatnot .
i know , i 've seen it myself . would you give that a try ?	i reckon .
i ca n't promise he 'll hire you . i 'll have to tell him about your history .	i never was no good with history .
no , i mean your past . about why you were in here . i 'll take you first thing in the mornin ' . you have anyplace you can stay tonight at all ? i just ca n't let you stay here . it 's the rules . if something happened well , i 'd be liable .	i reckon i can just walk around till the mornin ' . or set and read me a book somewhere .
she 's talkin ' about me , karl . that 's my first name .	he 's a-carryin ' me to look fer work in millsburg where i was borned .
karl , you up ?	yes sir .
did n't you go to sleep at all , karl ? you been sittin ' there like that all night ?	yes sir .
are you sure you 're okay staying with that woman and boy ?	yes sir .
do they know about you ?	my history .
yeah .	i told 'em about it . they know i 'm well . that mizz wheatley made me some biscuits .
i 'll be .	that boy , he 's my friend . he likes the way i talk and i like the way he talks .
hey , vaughan . how are you , karl ?	tolerable , i reckon .
you scared me .	i did n't aim to .
want to sit down ? did you need somethin ' ?	no ma'am .
two fellers was on a bridge a takin ' a leak and one feller says the water was cold and the other said it was deep water . one of 'em came from arkansas , i believe .	i 'll be dog .
do you reckon you can make me some biscuits ?	right now ?
just whenever you take a notion to . i do n't aim to put you out .	well , it is nearly breakfast time anyway . i ca n't go to sleep . i have to be at work in three hours . you know how it is when you just sleep an hour or two , you feel worse than if you had n't slept at all ?
yes ma'am .	well , set down and i 'll make some biscuits and gravy .
mustard 's good on 'em to me .	okay .
thank ye .	it 's all right . you know i was thinkin ' there 's this girl that works with me . she 's real heavy , but she 's cute in the face . well , you know , she 's slow . she 's a little bit , i think . she 's not retarded , just -- it do n't matter , listen to me . i thought you might like to meet her . vaughan wants to have a little supper over at his house and we could invite her . would you like that ?
i would n't mind a havin ' supper .	vaughan 's `` friend '' will be there , too . he works at the funeral home . and frank . you know frank likes you a lot . he says you make him feel calm .
hit ai n't right for me to keep from tellin ' you how come me to be put in the state hospital .	that 's okay . it 's not really my business . i have wondered though . why was it ? was it like a nervous breakdown ?
was that you ? i remember that . i was only three or four , but i always heard about it growin ' up . they say you 're well ?	yes ma'am . i like your garage . i would n't never hurt you or your boy . i 'd lay my hand on the bible and say the same thing .
karl , why do n't you and melinda go take a walk . it 's nice out .	all right then .
you 're a hell of a boy , frank . someday you 're gon na get all the good things you deserve . and karl here 's gon na get some more biscuits tonight . what do you think about that ?	i could shore use some . thank ye .
where are you goin ' , karl ? did n't you want some chicken and things ?	no ma'am . i 'm a'goin ' off sommers .
well , okay . i got you some .	frank , he went off , too . he ai n't gon na be in there when you get indoors .
where 'd he go ? what 's goin ' on ?	he wanted to go off and play , i reckon . you go in there and you and that doyle eat ye dinner . you do n't have to worry yourself none .
all right then . well , i 'll see you later . if you see frank , tell him to come on back home . i do n't get to see him all day except sundays . he can play tomorrow .	ma'am ?
yeah .	you 're a good mama to that boy . you care for him . you work hard fer him to take care of him . you light him up in his eyes , i 've seen it . he would n't know what to do without ye .
well thank you , hun . that 's real good of you to say . i would n't know what to do without him either .	you 've been real good to me , too . it ai n't ever'body that 'd make biscuits in the middle of the night . you and that boy has give me a good feelin ' .
we sure like havin ' you .	thank ye . i 'm just getting around to tellin ' you , but i fixed your warshin ' machine .
i do n't think i 've ever seen you before .	naw , i do n't believe you have . i do n't reckon i never been in here . this store did n't used to be here .
it 's been here seventeen years . did you live here before or something ?	i 's horned and raised here up till i 's twelve year old .
what brings you back ?	what 's that you say ?
why are you here now ?	they turned me loose from the state hospital .
is that right ? are you going to be staying here long ?	i reckon mr. woolridge got me hired on to work for bill cox 's outfit .
do you have family here ?	not really to speak of .
yes sir .	so , you 're really going to stay here ?
that boy wants me to .	did you knock on the door yet ?
naw , i ai n't .	how long have you been standing here ?
quite a spell , i reckon .	listen , before you get very used to staying here , i think you and i need to talk about a few things . can i take you to lunch ?
i done et just a little bit ago .	i mean tomorrow or the next day .
i reckon i can stand to eat a little somethin ' or 'nother at noontime tomorrow . bill cox generally gets me a box of french fried potaters . but i reckon he can lay off doin ' it tomorrow .	okay , i 'll come by mr. cox 's and get you at noon .
okay , karl , the reason i brought you here was to talk to you about something that is on my mind . i guess i 'll put it right out on the table . where do i start . linda and frank are very important to me . they 're like family . my own family was never like family . they 're horrible people . as a matter of fact i prayed every night for years that my father would die . i finally realized through a lot of therapy that i was wasting my energy on hating him . now i just do n't care . you see , you and i are a lot alike , strange as that may seem . i mean not physically or even mentally really , just well , maybe emotionally or actually the hand we 've been dealt in life . we 're different . people see us as being different anyway . you 're -- well you have your affliction or whatever and i , well mine 's not as easy to see . i 'm just going to say it . i 'm gay . does that surprise you ? that i 'm gay . you know what being gay is , do n't you ?	i reckon not .
homosexual . i like men . sexually .	not funny , ha , ha , funny queer .
well that 's a very offensive way to put it . you should n't say that . you were taught that , were n't you ?	i 've heard it said that way .
anyway , it 's hard to live gay , that 's the right way to say it , in a small town like this . i 've wanted to leave many times , but my love for linda and frank and another certain person that we wo n't go into have kept me from it . anyway , i 'm rambling . if you 're going to live in the wheatly garage you need to know that it wo n't be easy . doyle is a monster . not just a closed minded redneck , but a monster . a dangerous person . i 've told linda that one day that man is going to really hurt her or that boy . maybe even kill one of them . i see it in his eyes . i 'm very in tune , maybe even psychic . doyle will make your life hell . you 're a perfect target . when i first saw you i was afraid of you . not really afraid , i guess , just taken aback . but also , i felt a real sensitive feeling from you . and for some reason , frank has adopted you . much like a stray animal . i 'm sorry , i did n't mean it like that . in a good way . anyway , i just want you to know what you 're in for . i have a good feeling about you . you 're good for frank . maybe it 's that he can have an adult friend on a child 's level . i 'm sorry , i did n't mean it in a bad way . there 's one more thing . it 's none of my business why you were in the state hospital . everyone has something in their past , maybe you tried suicide , maybe you did something -- terrible . but what i see before me is a gentle , simple man . all i want you to promise me is that you 're capable of being around linda and frank . you know . you would never hurt them under any circumstances , would you ?	i would n't never hurt them .
i was thinkin ' i could use me another helpin ' of these potaters .	oh . how about before that ?
i think karl is going to be a writer or a librarian eventually . you should see all the books he has . he must read constantly .	i ai n't read 'em yet except two or three of 'em . i ca n't understand a lot of what i try to read . my mind , hit wonders off to somethin ' else when i try to read .
karl , what are you doing here ? come in .	i ai n't a-stayin ' . i need to ast you fer a favor .
okay .	this evenin ' i want you to go get mizz wheatley and that frank and have them stay with you tonight .
what 's wrong ? is everything okay ?	that dern doyle is in a bad way again with that drinkin ' and bein ' mean to folks . will you give me your word you 'll do it ?
well , sure , okay . he has n't hurt them , has he ?	naw , not yet . i want ye to give this to mizz wheatley . hit ai n't much , but maybe there 's a little somethin ' to hep out . hits what i 've earned fixin ' lawnmowers and whatnot fer bill cox .
what about you , karl ? do you want to stay here ?	i do n't reckon you have to go with women to be a daddy to a boy . you 've been real square dealin ' with me . the bible says two men ort not lay together . but i 'll bet you the good lord would n't send nobody like you to hades . some folks calls it hell , i call it hades . that boy lives inside of his own heart . hits an awful big place . you take care of that boy .
frank , do n't talk that way . who 's that strange lookin ' man behind you ? did he follow you in here ?	can i help you , sir ?
he just got out of the state hospital .	i know .
are you sure it 's safe to let him around that guy ?	frank 's just crazy about him . he likes the way he talks . he helped him carry home the clean laundry .
he 's been in the state hospital a long time , something must be wrong with him .	he 's retarded 's all . you know he 's always after a father figure and lord knows doyle ai n't a good one with his mean ass .
what about me ?	i do n't think he sees you as a guy guy .
good . i have n't decided yet if i 'm a good cook .	hey karl , you know what ? melinda was voted employee of the month at the dollar store last february . is n't that somethin ' ?
karl , maybe you and melinda might want to take a walk or something after dinner . it 's a nice night .	vaughan , do n't get pushy .
listen everybody , i know this may sound corny , i 've had a few glasses of wine and that kind of makes me a little emotional , but i 'm going to say it anyway . it just came over me in a rush . i want you all to know that i care about each and every one of you at this table .	that 's very sweet of you vaughan . we care about you , too . do n't we y'all ?
i do n't know why you 're so weirded out , this is not san quentin , it 's just a nuthouse . most of these people do n't even know where they are , they 're not gon na hurt you .	in a few minutes we 're gon na be in a room with a killer . that does n't bother you ?
hey , you 're the one that wanted to major in journalism . anyhow , was n't the guy something like twelve or thirteen when he did it , it was twenty-five years ago , he probably does n't even remember it .	do you smell shit ?
let 's just go , marsha .	no , we have to get this story .
i thought you 'd be happy to leave .	why wo n't he talk to women ?
my name 's jerry woolridge .	nice to meet you . i 'm marsha dwiggins and this is theresa evans . she 's here to take the pictures .
y'all have a seat . is this all of you ?	yes sir .
i think there must have been a little mix up . i told your sponsor or teacher or whatever he is , there could n't be any pictures . it 's s'posed to be just a little story or article or something , is n't that right ?	well , yeah , it 's for the school newspaper . but it has pictures . i mean it 's a regular paper , you know .
karl 's real sensitive about having his picture made . he would n't even be on the bulletin board for the easter collage . melvin , would you get me a good hot cup with two sugar substitutes ? you girls want some coffee ?	no thank you .
i do n't know what to tell you . i 'm sorry . i made myself pretty clear i thought . he probably got busy and was n't thinking . i know how that is . i used to teach shop and eighth grade science .	well , what do we do ? we drove all the way out here .
ca n't you talk to him ? maybe talk him into it . i 'm a real good interviewer . just get me in the room with him .	melvin , go get karl and take him down to the old classroom .
you see , karl , growing up , only knew that sex was wrong and that people who did it should be killed for it . he could n't really read but , well , neither could his mother . but , his father made sure that his mother knew what the bible said . and she made sure karl knew . you know he slept in a hole in the ground under a toolshed , right ?	i knew he slept in a toolshed .
his mother told him that he was their punishment . hers and his father 's ; from god , for having sex --	before they were married ?
i do n't think so . just period , i think . she told him ... god gave them the ugliest creation he could think of . karl has an entire book -- a notebook . on every page it says `` franklin chapter 1 verse number 1 . '' he wrote that a few years ago after he 'd learned to write . his father 's name was franklin .	that 's really strange . what does it mean ?
but , here 's the thing . he 'll only talk to you . he does n't want you to ask him anything . and you should n't stare at him .	how am i going to conduct an interview if i ca n't ask him any questions ?
it 's the best you 're gon na get . i 'm sorry .	can i ask you a question ? if he 's so troubled , why are you letting him out ? what if he does it again ? it happens all the time .
he 's free . his time 's up . that 's the rules . he 's been treated and reevaluated . he does n't show any signs any more .	signs ?
is he leaving right this minute ?	we 've got some paperwork to take care of . pretty soon . do n't worry , you wo n't run into him in the parking lot .
i did n't mean that .	i hope the best for you , miss dwiggins , with your school and your paper and all .
where will he go ?	wherever he wants to . i think he 's going back to millsburg where he 's from . it 's just about twenty miles from here .
will he be supervised ?	as much as anybody else is , i guess . y'all have a good rest of the day now .
also , melinda , please do n't tell anybody at the store that albert was here tonight , okay .	why ?
well , a lot of people in town talk and spread cruel rumors . unfortunately , i have to keep certain parts of my life private .	you mean about y'all bein ' together in `` that '' way ?
yes .	i think everybody at the store knows that already . they always talk about it . maureen ledbetter told a awful story about why you ai n't allowed over at the first baptist church no more .
it 's coming along . at the rate he 's going , he 'll have a story finished by the end of the summer .	wonderful . when your next book is published , maybe you could come into the store and do a signing . i 'm sure we could get a lot of people to show up .
what !	perhaps i should rephrase the question . what i mean to say is , are you married or seriously involved with a significant other ?
no ! at least i do n't think i am !	good . then may i have the honor of extending an invitation to you ?
and what 's the occasion of this celebration ?	it 's my birthday .
and how many people will be attending this birthday party ?	i would n't actually call it a party . it 's more along the lines of a dinner in celebration of my birthday . the guest list is quite restricted . so far , there 's mr. benjamin and myself . if you accept , that would make three of us .
ah-hah , i see . a cozy dinner . but are n't threesomes a little awkward ? how does the phrase go --	three 's a crowd . yes , i 'm aware of that . but i have to keep an eye on mr. benjamin wherever he goes . to make sure he does n't get himself into trouble .
and what are you , his chaperone ?	actually , i 'm his father .
like me , too .	i once read somewhere that one quarter of all the people in the united states have at least one relative who has lived in brooklyn at one time or another .
will that be cash or charge ?	better make it charge .
i thought i recognized you . you 're paul benjamin the writer , are n't you ?	i confess .
so your mother grew up in shanghai ?	until she was twelve . she moved here in 'forty-nine .
and your father ? is he from new york ?	muncie , indiana . he and my mother met as students . but i 'm from brooklyn . my sisters and i were all born and bred right here .
and the bookstore ? have you been working there long ?	it 's just a summer job . something to help pay the bills while i finish my dissertation .
your dissertation ? what subject do you study ?	american literature . what else ?
what else . of course , what else ? and what are you writing about for your thesis ?	visions of utopia in nineteenth-century american fiction .
wow . you do n't fool around , do you ?	of course i fool around . but not so much when it comes to my work , it 's true . have you ever read pierre , or the ambiguities ?
melville , huh ? it 's been a while .	that 's the subject of my last chapter .
not an easy book .	which explains why this has n't been the easiest summer of my life .
jesus , what happened to you ?	it looks worse than it is . i 'm okay .
what happened ?	i 'll tell you all about it ... ... but not here .
it 's been a while . i thought maybe you 'd be in touch .	yeah , well , i 've sort of been out of commission . how 's melville ?
i finished my story . i thought you might want to take a look at it .	i 'd love to .
good . i hope you like it . it was a long time in coming .	i get off for lunch in ten minutes . can i treat you to a hamburger ?
uh ... actually , it might be better if you read the story first . call me when you 're finished , okay ?	okay . i 'll read it tonight and call you tomorrow . it does n't seem to be too long .
what 'll it be , auggie ?	uh ... my friend over here would like a corned beef on rye and a ginger ale .
and what about for you ?	huh ?
what about for you ?	for me ? i 'll have the same thing .
do me a favor , will you ?	what 's that , sol ?
next time , when you want two corned beef sandwiches , say , `` two corned beef sandwiches . '' when you want two ginger ales , say , `` two ginger ales . ''	what 's the difference ?
it 's simpler , that 's what . it makes things go faster .	uh , sure , sol . anything you say . instead of saying , `` one corned beef sandwich , '' and then , `` another corned beef sandwich , '' i 'll say , `` two corned beef sandwiches . ''
hey , auggie . how 's it going ?	hey , man . good to see you . what 'll it be today ?
two tins of schimmelpennincks . and throw in a lighter while you 're at it .	the boys and i were just having a philosophical discussion about women and cigars . some interesting connections there , do n't you think ?
definitely . i suppose it all goes back to queen elizabeth .	the queen of england ?
seven eighty-five out of twenty . take care of yourself now , and do n't do anything i would n't do .	i would n't think of it . see you around , fellas .
are you closed ?	you run out of schimmelpennincks ?
do you think i could buy some before you leave ?	no problem . it 's not as though i 'm rushing off to the opera or anything .
looks like someone forgot a camera .	yeah , i did .
it 's yours ?	it 's mine all right . i 've owned that little sucker for a long time .
i did n't know you took pictures .	i guess you could call it a hobby . it does n't take me more than about five minutes a day to do it , but i do it every day . rain or shine , sleet or snow . sort of like the postman . sometimes it feels like my hobby is my real job , and my job is just a way to support my hobby .
so you 're not just some guy who pushes coins across a counter .	that 's what people see , but that ai n't necessarily what i am .
how 'd you get started ?	taking pictures ? it 's a long story . i 'd need two or three drinks to get through that one .
a photographer ...	well , let 's not exaggerate . i take pictures . you line up what you want in the viewfinder and click the shutter . no need to mess around with all that artisto crap .
i 'd like to see your pictures some day .	it can be arranged . seeing as how i 've read your books . i do n't see why i should n't share my pictures with you . it would be an honor .
they 're all the same .	that 's right . more than four thousand pictures of the same place . the corner of 3rd street and seventh avenue at eight o'clock in the morning . four thousand straight days in all kinds of weather . that 's why i can never take a vacation . i 've got to be in my spot every morning . every morning in the same spot at the same time .
i 've never seen anything like it .	it 's my project . what you 'd call my life 's work .
amazing . i 'm not sure i get it , though . i mean , how did you ever come up with the idea to do this ... this project ?	i do n't know , it just came to me . it 's my corner , after all . it 's just one little part of the world , but things happen there , too , just like everywhere else . it 's a record of my little spot .
it 's kind of overwhelming .	you 'll never get it if you do n't slow down , my friend .
what do you mean ?	i mean , you 're going too fast . you 're hardly even looking at the pictures .
but they 're all the same .	they 're all the same , but each one is different from every other one . you 've got your bright mornings and your dark mornings . you 've got your summer light and your autumn light . you 've got your weekdays and your weekends . you 've got your people in overcoats and galoshes , and you 've got your people in shorts and t-shirts . sometimes the same people , sometimes different ones . and sometimes the different ones become the same , and the same ones disappear . the earth revolves around the sun , and every day the light from the sun hits the earth at a different angle .
slow down , huh ?	yeah , that 's what i 'd recommend . you know how it is . tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow , time creeps on its petty pace .
yeah . there she is . she 's in quite a few from that year . she must have been on her way to work .	it 's ellen . look at her . look at my sweet darling .
hey , man , good to see you .	this is april lee , auggie . april , say hello to auggie wren .
so , what brings you to a dive like this ?	it 's his birthday so we decided to whoop it up a little .
hey , auggie , i 've just been thinking . you would n't need some help around the store , would you ? some summer help while vinnie 's gone ?	help ? hmm . it 's possible . what did you have in mind ?
i 'm thinking about the kid . i 'm sure he 'd do a good job for you .	hey , kid . you interested in a job ? i just got word from your employment agency that you 're looking for a position in retail sales .
the kid 's sorry , auggie .	yeah , well , i 'm sorry too . it took me three years to save up those five thousand bucks , and now i 'm broke . i ca n't hardly pay for this beer . not to speak of having my credibility destroyed . do you understand what i 'm saying ? my credibility . so yeah , i 'm sorry , too . about as sorry as i 've ever been in my whole fucking life .
he 's got something to tell you , auggie .	if he 's got something to tell me , why do n't he tell it to me himself ?
do n't be an ass , auggie . he 's trying to make it up to you , ca n't you see that ?	he 's crazy .
no , he 's not . you are .	you 're right . i just was n't sure you knew .
it 's written all over you like a neon sign . now say something nice to rashid to make him feel better .	fuck you , kid .
it could have been worse . if the cops had n't come , i might not be standing here now .	cops ? you mean they nabbed those cruds ?
no . the ... uh ... the bobbsey twins lit out when they heard the sirens . but at least they stopped playing that marimba duet on my skull . assaultus interruptus .	fuckus my assus . they did some number on you .
you have n't heard from rashid , have you ?	not a peep .
i spoke to his aunt a couple of days ago , but she has n't heard from him either . it 's beginning to get a little scary .	that could be a good sign , though . it could mean that he got away .
so what did he say when he called ?	nothing much . he said his socks and underpants were dirty , and would we mind driving up with his things . fucking kids , huh ? they take you for granted every time .
nice machine , auggie . where 'd you find it ?	it 's tommy 's . the sucker owed me a favor .
it 's not a long drive . an hour , an hour and a half . we 'll be back in time for dinner .	we 'd better be . i have n't spent a night out of brooklyn in fourteen years , and i 'm not about to break my record now . besides , i 've got to be on my corner at eight sharp tomorrow morning .
hey , man , how 's it going ?	hi , auggie .
two , right ?	uh , better make it one .
you usually get two .	yeah , i know , but i 'm trying to cut down . somebody 's worried about my health .
fine . or it was until a couple of days ago . a guy from the new york times called and asked me to write a christmas story . they want to publish it on christmas day .	that 's a feather in your cap , man . the paper of record .
yeah , great . the problem is , i have four days to come up with something , and i do n't have a single idea . you know anything about christmas stories ?	christmas stories ? sure , i know a ton of 'em .
anything good ?	good ? of course . are you kidding ? i 'll tell you what . buy me lunch , my friend , and i 'll tell you the best christmas story you ever heard . how 's that ? and i guarantee every word of it is true .
it does n't have to be true . it just has to be good .	take over the register while i 'm gone , okay , jimmy ?
i have to pee . if the waiter comes , order me a corned beef on rye and a ginger ale , okay ?	you got it .
so . are we ready ?	ready . any time you are .
i 'm all ears .	okay . you remember how you once asked me how i started taking pictures ? well , this is the story of how i got my first camera . as a matter of fact , it 's the only camera i 've ever had . are you following me so far ?
every word .	okay . so this is the story of how it happened . okay . it was the summer of 'seventy-six , back when i first started working for vinnie . the summer of the bicentennial . a kid came in one morning and started stealing things from the store . he 's standing by the rack of paperbacks near the front window stuffing skin magazines under his shirt . it was crowded around the counter just then , so i did n't see him at first ... .
did you ever go back to see her ?	once , about three or four months later . i felt so bad about stealing the camera , i had n't even used it yet . i finally made up my mind to return it , but granny ethel was n't there anymore . someone else had moved into the apartment , and he could n't tell me where she was .
she probably died .	yeah , probably .
which means that she spent her last christmas with you .	i guess so . i never thought of it that way .
it was a good deed , auggie . it was a nice thing you did for her .	i lied to her , and then i stole from her . i do n't see how you can call that a good deed .
you made her happy . and the camera was stolen anyway . it 's not as if the person you took it from really owned it .	anything for art , eh , paul ?
i would n't say that . but at least you 've put the camera to good use .	and now you 've got your christmas story , do n't you ?
what do you mean ?	i mean , it 's a good story .
shit . if you ca n't share your secrets with your friends , what kind of friend are you ?	exactly . life just would n't be worth living , would it ?
christ , ruby , it 's been so long . i figured you were dead .	eighteen and a half years .
is that all ? i thought it was about three hundred .	you 're looking good , auggie .
no i 'm not . i look like shit . and so do you , ruby . you look just awful . what 's with the patch , anyway ? what 'd you do with that old blue marble -- hock it for a bottle of gin ?	i do n't want to talk about it . if you really want to know . i lost it . and i 'm not sorry i did . that eye was cursed , auggie , and it never gave me nothing but grief .
and you think it looks better to go around dressed up like captain hook ?	you always were a son-of-a-bitch , were n't you ? a little weasel with a quick , dirty mouth .
at least i 've stayed true to myself . which is more than i can say about some people .	i 've got something to talk to you about , and the least you can do is listen . you owe me that much . i drove all the way from pittsburgh to see you , and i 'm not going until you 've heard me out .
talk away , lady of my dreams . i 'm all ears .	this is private , auggie . just between you and i .
all right , sugar , what 's on your mind ?	do n't look at me like that . auggie . it gives me the creeps .
like what ?	like what you 're doing . i 'm not going to eat you up . i need your help , and if you keep staring at me like that . i might start screaming .
help , huh ? and i do n't suppose this help has anything to do with money , does it ?	do n't rush me , okay ? you 're jumping to conclusions before i 've even said anything . and besides , it 's not for me . it 's for our daughter .
our daughter ? is that what you said ? our daughter ? i mean , you might have a daughter , but i sure as hell do n't . and even if i did -- which i do n't -- she would n't be our daughter .	her name is felicity , and she just turned eighteen . she ran away from pittsburgh last year , and now she 's living in some shit-hole here in brooklyn with a guy named chico . strung out on crack , four months pregnant . i ca n't bear to think about that baby . our grandchild , auggie . just think of it . our grandchild .
stop it , already . just stop all this crap right now . was that your idea to call her felicity ?	it means `` happiness . ''
i know what it means . that still do n't make it a good name .	i do n't know who else to turn to , auggie .
you 've suckered me before , darling , remember ? why should i believe you now ?	why would i lie to you , auggie ? you think it was easy to come here and walk into this place ? why would i do it if i did n't have to ?
that 's what you told me when i shoplifted that necklace for you . you remember , baby , do n't you ? the judge gave me a choice : either go to the can or enlist . so , instead of going to college , i wind up in the navy for four years , i watch men lose their arms and legs , i nearly get my head blown off , and you , sweet ruby mcnutt , you run off and marry that asshole , bill .	you did n't write to me for more than a year . what was i supposed to think ?
yeah , well , i lost my pen . by the time i got a new one , i was clean out of paper .	it was over with bill before you ever came home . maybe you do n't remember it now , but you were pretty hot to see me back then .
you were n't so lukewarm yourself . at least at first .	it fizzled , baby . that 's the way it goes . but we had our times , did n't we ? it was n't all bad .
a couple of moments , i 'll grant you that . a second or two snatched from the jaws of eternity .	and that 's how felicity came into the picture . during one of those two seconds .
you 're conning me , sweetheart . i ai n't responsible for no baby .	then why do you think i married frank ? i was already pregnant , and i did n't have much time . say what you like , but at least he gave my kid a name .
good old frank . and how is fat mr. grease monkey these days ?	who the hell knows ? he dropped out of sight fifteen years ago .
fifteen years ago ? it wo n't wash , pumpkin . no mother waits fifteen years to tell a man he 's a father . i was n't born yesterday , you know .	i thought i could handle it . i did n't want to bug you . i thought i could handle it on my own , but i could n't . she 's in real bad , auggie .
nice try , old girl . i 'd like to help you out . you know , for old time 's sake . but all my spare cash is tied up in a business venture , and i have n't collected my profits yet . too bad . you caught me at the wrong time .	you 're a cold-hearted bastard , are n't you ? how 'd you ever get so mean , auggie ?
get in , auggie . i 've got something to show you .	you do n't give up , do you ?
just get in and shut up . i 'm not asking you to do anything . i just need you to come with me .	where to ?
i told her she was going to meet her father .	you what ?
it was the only way , auggie . otherwise , she was n't going to let me see her .	i think you 'd better stop the car and let me out .
relax , okay ? you do n't have to do anything . just go in there and pretend . it wo n't kill you to do a little favor like that . besides , you might even learn something .	yeah , like what ?
that i was n't bullshitting you , sweetheart . at least you 'll know i 've been telling the truth .	look , i 'm not saying you do n't have a daughter . it 's just that she 's not my daughter .
wait till you see her , auggie .	and what 's that supposed to mean ?
she looks just like you .	cut it out . just cut it out , okay ? it 's starting to get on my nerves .
jesus christ . this is all i need .	you told me you wanted to meet him . well , here he is .
so you 're just going to give up and go home ?	i do n't have much choice , do i ? it 's pretty clear she does n't want me around .
still , you ca n't just write her off .	yeah ? and what else am i supposed to do ? there 's no baby anymore , and if she wants to throw away her life , that 's her business .
she 's just a kid . there 's time for more babies later . after she grows up .	dream on , auggie . she 'll be lucky to make it to her nineteenth birthday .
not if you got her into one of those rehab programs .	i 'd never be able to talk her into it . and even if i could , those things cost money . and that 's just what i do n't have . i 'm flat out dead broke .
no you 're not .	are you calling me a liar ? i 'm telling you i 'm broke . i do n't even have insurance on my goddamned car .
remember that business venture i was telling you about ? well , my tugboat came in . i 'm flush .	bully for you .
what 's this ?	why do n't you open it and find out ?
jesus god , auggie . there 's money in here .	five thousand bucks .
and you 're giving it to me ?	it 's all yours , baby .
for keeps ?	for keeps .
fuck this angel shit . just take the dough , ruby . but no bawling , okay ? i ca n't stand people who blubber .	i 'm sorry , baby . i ca n't help it .
there 's just one thing i want to know .	anything , auggie . just name it .
okay . i think everything 's set . you 've got the number for cape cod , right ? just in case something goes wrong .	no problem , vinnie . everything 's under control . i could run this store in my sleep .
how long you been working for me , auggie ?	i do n't know . thirteen , fourteen years . something like that .
it 's pretty crazy , do n't you think ? i mean , a smart guy like you . what do you want to hang on to a dead-end job like this for ?	i do n't know . maybe because i love you so much , boss .
shit . you should have been married to someone by now . you know , settled down somewhere with a kid or two , a nice steady job .	i almost got married once .
yeah , i know . to that girl who moved to pittsburgh .	ruby mcnutt . my one true love .
sounds like another one of your stories to me .	she upped and married some other cat after i joined the navy . by the time i got my discharge , though , she was divorced . her husband poked out her eye in a domestic quarrel .
lovely .	she made a play for me after i got back , but her glass eye kept interfering with my concentration . every time we got into a clinch , i 'd start thinking about that hole in her head , that empty socket with the glass eye in it . an eye that could n't see , an eye that could n't shed any tears . the minute i started thinking about it , mr. johnson would get all soft and small . and i ca n't see getting married if mr. johnson is n't going to be in tiptop shape .
you do n't take anything seriously , do you ?	i try not to , anyway . it 's better for your health . i mean , look at you , vincent . you 're the guy with the wife and three kids and the ranch house on long island . you 're the guy with the white shoes and the white caddy and the white shag carpet . but you 've had two heart attacks , and i 'm still waiting for my first .
i should stop smoking these damn things is what i should do . the fuckers are going to kill me one day .	enjoy it while you can , vin . pretty soon , they 're going to legislate us out of business anyway .
they catch you smoking tobacco , they 'll stand you up against a wall and shoot you .	tobacco today , sex tomorrow . in three or four years , it 'll probably be against the law to smile at strangers .
speaking of which , are you still going ahead with that deal on the montecristos ?	it 's all set . my guy in miami said he 'd have them within the next few weeks . are you sure you do n't want to go in with me ? five thousand dollars outlay , a guaranteed ten-thousand-dollar return . a consortium of court street lawyers and judges . they 're just drooling to get their lips around some genuine cuban cigars .
no thanks . i do n't care what you do , but just make sure you do n't get caught , okay ? the last i heard , it was still illegal to sell cuban cigars in this country .	it 's the law that 's buying . that 's what 's so beautiful about it . i mean , when was the last time you heard of a judge sending himself to jail ?
suit yourself . but do n't keep the boxes around here long .	they come in , they go out . i 've got it planned to the last detail .
i 've got to get moving . terry will bust my chops if i 'm late . see you in september , auggie .	okay , my man . love to the wife and kids , et cetera , et cetera . drop me a postcard if you can remember the address .
seventeen .	seventeen ? i remember when i was seventeen . christ , i was one little whacked-out son-of-a-bitch when i was seventeen . is that what you are , son ? one little whacked-out crazy fella ?
definitely . i 'd say you 've hit the nail on the head .	good . keep it up , and maybe one day you 'll grow up and become a great man like me .
a job ? i definitely would n't turn down a job .	come around to the cigar store tomorrow morning at ten o'clock and we 'll talk about it , okay ? we 'll see what we can work out .
i 'll be back in about an hour . watch the register while i 'm gone , okay ?	sure thing . see you later .
a little . not much .	this way , gentlemen . let 's retire to my office , shall we ?
it 's for you .	for me ? and what am i supposed to do with a paper bag ?
open it .	what is this , some kind of joke ?
no , it 's five thousand dollars .	shit . i do n't want your money , you little twerp . it 's probably stolen anyway .
what do you care where it comes from ? it 's yours .	and why the hell would you give me money ?
so i can get my job back .	your job ? you 've got five thousand bucks . what do you want a piece-of-shit job like that for ?
to look at the dirty magazines . i can see all the naked women i want , and it does n't cost me a cent .	you 're a dumb , whacked-out little fuck , do you know that ?
come on , come on , you yellow belly . the whole thing . first name and last name .	what difference does it make ?
how 'd you do out there , jimmy ?	good , auggie . real good . all finished .
it 'll never be finished .	huh ?
that 's how it is with sidewalks . people come , people go , and they all drop shit on the ground . as soon as you clean up one spot and move on to the next , the first spot is dirty again .	i just do what you tell me , auggie . you tell me to sweep , so i sweep .
sure , auggie , i got it . the store 's closed . and when do i tell them it 's open ?	when i tell you it 's open . it 's open when i tell you it 's open !
... if it happens , it happens . if it does n't , it does n't . do you understand what i 'm saying ? you never know what 's going to happen next , and the moment you think you know , that 's the moment you do n't know a goddamn thing . that 's what we call a paradox . are you following me ?	sure , auggie . i follow . when you do n't know nothing , it 's like paradise . i know what that is . it 's after you 're dead and you go up to heaven and sit with the angels .
does it hurt ?	of course it hurts . what does it look like ?
they do n't come cheap , son . these little honeys are works of art . rolled by hand in a tropical climate , most likely by an eighteen year old girl in a thin cotton dress with no underwear on . little beads of sweat forming in her naked cleavage . the smooth , delicate fingers nimbly turning out one masterpiece after another ...	and how much are these ?
seventy-eight dollars . the girl who rolled these was probably wearing panties .	and these ?
fifty-six . that girl had on a corset .	and these ?
forty-four . they 're on special this week from the canary islands . a real bargain .	i think i 'll take them .
a good choice . you would n't want to celebrate the birth of your firstborn with a box of stinkers , would you ? remember to keep them in the refrigerator until you hand them out .	the refrigerator ?
it 'll keep them fresh . if they get too dry , they 'll break . and you do n't want that to happen , do you ? tobacco is a plant , and it needs the same loving care you 'd give an orchid .	thanks for the tip .
any time . and congratulations to you and your wife . just remember , though , in the immortal words of rudyard kipling : `` a woman is just a woman , but a cigar is a smoke .	what does that mean ?
is your name paul benjamin ?	what can i do for you ?
i just want to know what your game is , mister , that 's all .	how the hell did you get into the building ?
what do you mean , how 'd i get in ? i pushed the door and walked in . what do you think ?	the damn lock 's broken again . and so you just barge in on strangers , is that what you do ? is that your game ?
i 'm looking for my nephew , thomas .	thomas ? who 's thomas ?
do n't give me any of that . i know he 's been here . you ca n't fool me , mister .	i 'm telling you . i do n't know anyone named thomas .
thomas cole . thomas jefferson cole . my nephew .	you mean rashid ?
rashid ? rashid ! is that what he told you his name was ?	well , whatever his name is , he 's not here anymore . he left two days ago , and i have n't heard from him since .
and what was he doing here in the first place ? that 's what i want to know . what 's a man like you messing around with a black boy like thomas for ? are you some kind of pervert , or what ?	look , lady , that 's enough . if you do n't calm down . i 'm going to throw you out . do you hear me ? right now !
i just want to know where he is .	as far as i know , he went back to his parents .
his parents ? is that what he told you ? his parents ?	that 's what he said . he told me he lived with his mother and father on east seventy-fourth street .
i always knew that boy had an imagination , but now he 's gone and made up a whole new life for himself . do you mind if i sit down ? he 's been living with me and his uncle henry since he was a baby . and we do n't live in manhattan . we live in boerum hill . in the projects .	he does n't go to the trinity school ?
he goes to john jay high school in brooklyn .	and his parents ?
his mother 's dead , and he has n't seen his father in twelve years .	i should n't have let him go .
which brings me back to my original question . what was he doing here in the first place ?	i was about to get run over by a car , and your nephew pulled me back . he saved my life . i sensed he was in trouble , so i offered to put him up for a few days . maybe i should have pressed him a little more , i do n't know . i feel pretty stupid about it now .
he 's in trouble , all right . but i do n't have any idea what it is .	do you want something to drink ? a beer ? a glass of water ?
no thank you .	has anything happened lately ? anything unusual or unexpected ?
well , one thing i suppose , but i do n't think it has anything to do with this . a friend of mine called about two weeks ago and said she 'd spotted thomas 's father working at some gas station outside of peekskill .	and you told your nephew about it ?
i figured he had a right to know .	and ?
and nothing . thomas looked at me straight in the eye and said , `` i do n't have a father . as far as i 'm concerned , that son-of-a-bitch is dead . ''	those are pretty hostile words .
his father walked out on his mother a couple of months after he was born . louisa was henry 's younger sister , and she and the baby moved in with us . four or five years go by , and then one day cyrus shows up out of the blue , tail between his legs , wanting to patch things up with louisa . i thought henry was going to tear cyrus apart when he saw him walk through the door . they 're both big men , those two , and if they ever started to tangle , you 'd see some teeth jumping on the floor . i guarantee it ... so cyrus persuaded louisa to go out with him to talk things over in quiet . and the poor girl never came back .	you mean she just ran off with him and left her little boy behind ?
do n't put words in my mouth . what i 'm saying is she drove off in cyrus 's car and went to the five-spot lounge with him for a drink . what i 'm saying is that he imbibed too much in the way of alcohol and that when they finished their little talk three hours later and got back in the car , he was in no shape to drive . but he drove the car anyway , and before he could get her back to where she lived , the damn fool ran a red light and went straight into a truck . louisa got thrown through the windshield and was killed . cyrus lived , but he came out of it a cripple . his left arm was so mangled , the doctors had to cut it off . small punishment for what he did , if you ask me .	jesus .
jesus had nothing to do with it . if he 'd been involved . he would have seen to it that things worked out the opposite from what they did .	it ca n't have been easy on him . walking around with that on his conscience all these years .
no , i do n't suppose it has . he was broken up like nobody 's business in that hospital when he found out louisa was dead .	and he 's never tried to get in touch with his son ?
you going to sit here all day ?	i do n't know . i have n't decided yet .
why do n't you pick some other spot ? it gives a man the creeps to be stared at all morning .	it 's a free country , is n't it ? as long as i 'm not trespassing on your property . i can stay here till kingdom come .
let me give you some useful information , son . there 's two dollars and fifty-seven cents in that cash register over there and considering all the time you 've put in casing the joint so far , you wo n't make but about fifty cents an hour for all your pains . however you slice it , that 's a losing proposition .	i 'm not going to rob you , mister . do i look like a thief ?
i do n't know what you look like , boy . as far as i can tell , you sprouted up like a mushroom in this spot last night . you live in this town -- or on your way from here to there ?	just passing through .
just passing through . a lonesome traveler with a knapsack on his back plops himself across from my garage to admire the view . there 's other places to roam , kid , that 's all i 'm saying . you do n't want to make a nuisance of yourself .	i 'm working on a sketch . that old garage of yours is so rundown , it 's kind of interesting .
it 's rundown , all right . but drawing a picture wo n't improve the way it looks . let 's see what you did , rembrandt .	it 'll cost you five bucks .
five bucks ! you mean you 're going to charge me five bucks just to look at it ?	once you look at it , you 're going to want to buy it from me . that 's guaranteed . and that 's the price : five bucks . so if you 're not willing to spring for it , you might as well not bother to look . it 'll just tear you up inside and make you miserable .
son-of-a-bitch . you 're some piece of work , are n't you ?	i just tell it like it is , mister . if i 'm getting on your nerves , though , you might want to think about hiring me .
do you have eyes in your head , or are those brown things bulging out of your sockets just marbles ? you 've been sitting here all day , and how many cars have you seen drive up and ask for gas ?	not a one .
not a one . not one customer all day . i bought this broken-down shit-hole of a place three weeks ago , and if business do n't pick up soon , i 'm going straight down the skids . what do i want to be hiring someone for ? i ca n't even pay my own wages .	it was just a thought .
i 'll tell you what . you want to work . i 'll give you a job . nothing permanent , mind you , but that upstairs room over there -- the one above the office -- is a hell of a mess . it looks like they 've been throwing junk in there for twenty years , and it 's time it got cleaned up .	what 's your offer ?
five bucks an hour . that 's the going rate , is n't it ? it 's a quarter past two now . my wife 's picking me up at five-thirty , so that 'll give you about three hours . if you ca n't finish today , you can do the rest tomorrow .	is there a benefits package , or are you hiring me on a freelance basis ?
benefits ?	you know , health insurance , dental plan , paid vacation . it 's not fun being exploited . workers have to stand up for their rights .
i 'm afraid we 'll be working on a strictly freelance basis .	five dollars an hour ? i 'll take it .
the name is cyrus cole .	paul . paul benjamin .
i do n't mean to be nosy , but i was wondering what happened to your arm .	an ugly piece of hardware , is n't it ? i 'll tell you what happened to my arm . i 'll tell you what happened . twelve years ago , god looked down on me and said , `` cyrus , you 're a bad , stupid , selfish man . first of all , i 'm going to fill your body with spirits , and then i 'm going to put you behind the wheel of a car , and then i 'm going to make you crash that car and kill the woman who loves you . but you , cyrus , i 'm going to let you live , because living is a lot worse than death . and just so you do n't forget what you did to that poor girl , i 'm going to rip off your arm and replace it with a hook . if i wanted to , i could rip off both your arms and both your legs , but i 'm going to be merciful and just take off your left arm . every time you look at your hook , i want you to remember what a bad , stupid , selfish man you are . let that be a lesson to you , cyrus , a warning to mend your ways . ''
and have you mended them ?	i do n't know . i try . every day i keep on trying , but it 's no easy task for a man to change his nature . i 'm off the booze , though . have n't had a drop in six years . and now i 've got me a wife . doreen . best damned woman i 've ever known . and a little boy , too . cyrus junior . so things have definitely improved since i got fitted with this hook . if i can just turn this goddamn garage around , i 'll be in pretty good shape .
you named the kid after yourself , huh ?	that boy 's one in a million . a real tiger .
it 's only temporary . on a freelance basis .	and this one , in case you have n't guessed , is junior .
hi there , little brother .	say hi to paul .
that 's funny . his name is the same as yours .	well , you and junior have the same name , too , do n't you ?
yeah , but he 's my son . nothing strange about that . he 's my own flesh and blood . but here you got the same name as this man here , and you 're not even the same color .	that 's how we met . we 're members of the international same name club . believe it or not , there are 846 paul benjamins in america . but only two in the new york metropolitan area . that 's how paul and i got to be such good friends . we 're the only ones who show up at the meetings .
thomas .	paul . rashid . thomas . which one is it ?
thomas cole . my name is thomas jefferson cole .	are you making fun of me ? i wo n't be mocked . do you hear me ? i wo n't let no punk kid stand there and mock me !
i do n't like this . i do n't like it one bit .	louisa vail . remember her , cyrus ?
yeah ? who is it ?	it 's me , honey . it 's mom .
well ?	well what ?
are n't you going to say anything ?	what do you want me to say ?
i do n't know . hello , mom . hello , dad . something like that .	i do n't got no daddy , you dig ? i got born last week when some dog fucked you up the ass .
be nice , sweetie . we 're just here to help you .	help ? what the fuck do i need your help for ? i 've got a man , do n't i ? that 's more than you can say for yourself , hawkeye .
you can do whatever you want with your own life . we 're thinking of the baby , that 's all . we want you to get yourself cleaned up for the baby . before it 's too late .	baby ? and what baby is that ?
your baby . the baby you 're carrying around inside you .	yeah , well , there ai n't no baby in there now . you dig ? there 's nothing in there now .
what are you talking about ?	an abortion , stupid . i had an abortion the day before yesterday . so you do n't have to bug me about that shit anymore . bye-bye , baby !
i 'll tell you why they 're not going anywhere .	yeah ? and why is that ?
okay , joke about it . i do n't give a shit .	jesus , tommy , it ai n't science , you know . you got your good trades and your bad trades . that 's how it works .
sure . he 's the guy who threw his cloak down over the puddle .	i used to smoke raleigh cigarettes . they came with a free gift coupon in every pack .
of course there 's gon na be a war . you think they 'd send five hundred thousand troops over there just to lie in the sun ? i mean , there 's plenty of beach , but not a hell of a lot of water . half a million soldiers . it ai n't no seaside holiday , you can bet on that .	i do n't know , tommy . you think anyone gives a rat 's ass about kuwait ? i read something about the head sheik over there . he marries a different virgin every friday and then divorces her on monday . you think we want to have our kids dying for a guy like that ?
hey , jimmy . you got the time ?	huh ?
you still have that watch auggie gave you ?	tick-tock , tick-tock .
so what 's the time ?	twelve-eleven . twelve-twelve . twelve-twelve .
watch out , man . you 'll get yourself killed like that .	i ca n't believe i did that ... christ . i 'm walking around in a fog ...
no harm done . everything 's okay now . i 've got to be going .	no , wait . you ca n't just walk off . you saved my life .
i just happened to be there . the right place at the right time .	i owe you something .
it 's okay , mister . no big deal .	yes it is . it 's a law of the universe . if i let you walk away , the moon will spin out of orbit ... pestilence will reign over the city for a hundred years .
well , if you put it that way ...	you have to let me do something for you to put the scales in balance .
that 's all right . if i think of something , i 'll send my butler over to tell you .	come on . at least let me buy you a cup of coffee .
i do n't drink coffee . on the other hand , since you insist , if you offered me a cold lemonade . i would n't say no .	good . lemonade it is . i 'm paul .
are you sure you do n't want some food to go along with it ? it might help to absorb some of that liquid . you do n't want to slosh around too much when you stand up .	that 's okay . i 've already had lunch .
you must eat lunch pretty early . it 's only eleven o'clock .	i mean breakfast .
yeah , sure , and i bet you had lobster last night . along with two bottles of champagne .	just one bottle . i believe in moderation .
look , kid , it 's okay with me . you do n't have to play games . if you want a hamburger or something , go ahead and order it .	well , maybe just one . to be polite .
mostly what .	you do n't have to tell me if you do n't want to , but i might be able to help .
you do n't know me from a hole in the wall .	that 's true . but i also owe you something , and i 'm not sure that buying you a hamburger is going to do the job . what is it ? family problems ? money problems ?
oh no . momsie and popsie have oodles .	and where do momsie and popsie live ?
east seventy-fourth street .	in manhattan ?
of course . where else ?	then what are you doing in park slope ? it 's a little far from home , is n't it ?
that 's where the what comes in .	the what ?
the what . i 've kind of run away from home , you see . it has nothing to do with my parents or money . i saw something i was n't supposed to see , and for the time being it 's best that i keep myself out of sight .	you ca n't be more specific than that ?
here and there . around .	uh-huh . one of those cozy bed and breakfast places , probably .
yeah , that 's right .	except that there 's no bed , is there ? and no breakfast either .
the material world is an illusion . it does n't matter if they 're there or not . the world is in my head .	but your body is in the world , is n't it ? if someone offered you a place to stay , you would n't necessarily refuse , would you ?
people do n't do that kind of thing . not in new york .	i 'm not `` people . '' i 'm just me . and i do whatever i goddamn want to do . got it ?
thanks , but i 'll manage .	in case you 're wondering , i like women , not little boys . and i 'm not offering you a long-term lease -- just a place to crash for a couple of nights .
i can take care of myself . do n't worry .	suit yourself . but if you change your mind , here 's the address .
i did n't expect to see you again .	same here . but i had a long talk with my accountant this afternoon . you know , to see how a move like this would affect my tax picture , and he said it would be okay .
that 's it . just the two rooms .	this is the first house i 've been in without a tv .
i used to have one , but it broke a couple of years ago and i never got around to replacing it . i 'd just as soon not have one anyway . i hate those damn things .	but then you do n't get to watch the ball games . you told me you were a mets fan .
i listen on the radio . i can see the games just fine that way . the world is in your head , remember ?	nice drawing . did you do that ?
my father did . believe it or not , that little baby is me .	yeah , i can believe it .
it 's strange , though , is n't it ? looking at yourself before you knew who you were .	is your father an artist ?
no , he was a schoolteacher . but he liked to dabble .	he 's dead ?
twelve , thirteen years ago . actually , he died with his sketch pad open on his lap . up in the berkshires one weekend , drawing a picture of mount greylock .	drawing 's a good thing .
is that what you do ? draw pictures ?	yeah , sometimes . i like to dabble , too .
time to wake up . hey , kid , time to wake up . rashid ! up and out . i have to work in here . the slumber party is over .	what time is it ?
eight-thirty .	eight-thirty ?
jesus , do you make a lot of noise . ca n't you see i 'm trying to work ?	i 'm sorry . they just ... they just slipped out of my hands .
a little less clumsiness around here would be nice , do n't you think ?	i 'm a teenager . all teenagers are clumsy . it 's because we 're still growing . we do n't know where our bodies end and the world begins .
the world is going to end pretty soon if you do n't learn fast . look , why not make yourself useful ? i 'm just about out of smokes . go around the corner to the brooklyn cigar company and buy me two tins of schimmelpenninck medias .	twenty dollars is a lot of money . are you sure you can trust me with it ? i mean , are n't you afraid i might steal it ?
i 'm sorry . i 'm really sorry ... i was trying to reach for one of the books up there ... and then , i do n't know , the sky fell on top of me .	it just wo n't do , will it ? i go two and a half years without being able to write a word , and then , when i finally get started on something , when it looks as though i might actually be coming to life again , you show up and start breaking everything in my house . it just wo n't do , will it ?
i did n't ask to come here . you invited me , remember ? if you want me to leave , all you have to do is say so .	how long have you been here ?
three nights .	and how long did i tell you you could stay ?
two or three nights .	it sounds like our time is up , does n't it ?
i 'm sorry i messed up . you 've been very kind to me ... but all good things have to come to an end , right ?	no hard feelings , okay ? it 's a small place , and i ca n't get my work done with you around .
you do n't have to apologize . the coast is probably clear now anyway .	are you going to be all right ?
absolutely . the world is my oyster . whatever that means .	do you need some money ? some extra clothes ?
not a penny , not a stitch . i 'm cool , man .	take good care of yourself , okay ?
hey , it 's you .	i wanted to give you this as a token of my appreciation .
appreciation for what ?	i do n't know . for helping me out .
where did you get that thing ?	i bought it . twenty-nine ninety-five on sale at goldbaum 's tv and radio . well , that just about takes care of it , i guess . you 'll be able to watch the ball games . you know , as a little break from your work .
where the hell do you think you 're going ?	business appointment . i 'm seeing my broker at three o'clock .
cut it out , will you ? just cut it out and come back here .	i do n't have much time .
close the door . sit down in that chair . now listen carefully . your aunt em came here a couple of days ago . she was sick with worry , out of her mind . we had an interesting talk about you , thomas . do you understand what i 'm saying ? your aunt thinks you 're in trouble and so do i. tell me about it , kid . i want to hear all about it right now .	you do n't really want to know .
i do n't , huh ? and what makes you such an authority on what i want or do n't want ?	okay , okay . it 's all so stupid . there 's this guy , see . charles clemm . the creeper , that 's what people call him . the kind of guy you do n't want to cross paths with .
and ?	i crossed paths with him . that 's why i 'm trying to stay clear of my neighborhood . to make sure i do n't run into him again .
i just happened to be walking by ... all of a sudden , the creeper and this other guy come running out of this check-cashing place with masks on their faces and guns in their hands ... they just about ran smack into me . the creeper recognized me , and i knew he knew i recognized him ... if the guy from the check-cashing place had n't rushed out then screaming bloody murder , he would have shot me . i 'm telling you , the creeper would have shot me right there on the sidewalk . but the noise distracted him , and when he turned around to see what was happening , i took off ... one more second , and i would have been dead .	why do n't you go to the police ?
you 're joking , right ? i mean , that 's your way of trying to be funny , right ?	if they put this creeper in jail , then you 'd be safe .
the man has friends . and they 're not likely to forgive me if i testify against him .	what makes you think you 'll be any safer around here ? it 's only about a mile away from where you live .
it might not be far , but it 's another galaxy . black is black and white is white , and never the twain shall meet .	it looks like they 've met in this apartment .
that 's because we do n't belong anywhere . you do n't fit into your world , and i do n't fit into mine . we 're the outcasts of the universe .	maybe . or maybe it 's the other people who do n't belong .
let 's not get too idealistic .	fair enough . we would n't want to get carried away , would we ? now call your aunt em and let her know you 're alive .
ah , coffee . smells good .	one sip of this stuff and your eyes will blast open .
thanks .	what time did you get to bed last night ?
i do n't know . two or three . it was pretty late .	you work too hard , you know that ?
once a story gets hold of you , it 's hard to let go . besides , i 'm making up for lost time .	just so you do n't overdo it . you do n't want to die of sleep deprivation before you finish .
if you do n't sleep , you do n't dream . if you do n't dream , you do n't have nightmares .	that 's logical . and if you do n't sleep , you do n't need a bed . saves you money , too . so what 's this story you 're working on , anyway ?
if i tell you , i might not be able to finish it .	come on , just a little hint .
okay , just a little hint . i ca n't tell you the story , but i 'll tell you what gave me the idea for it .	the inspiration .
yeah , right . the inspiration . it 's a true story anyway , so i do n't suppose it can hurt , can it ?	no way .
all right . listen carefully . about twenty-five years ago , a young man went skiing alone in the alps . there was an avalanche , the snow swallowed him up , and his body was never recovered .	the end .
celebrate ? what for ?	it 's my birthday . i 'm seventeen years old as of forty-seven minutes ago , and i think i should celebrate having made it this far .
hey , hey . happy birthday . why did n't you tell me ?	i just did .
here we are . rembrandt 's drawings . edward hopper . van gogh 's letters .	pick two or three . now that the coffers are open , you might as well take advantage of me .
uh , actually , i tend to shy away from that kind of thing .	excuse me for asking , but you are n't married , are you ?
yes , an invitation . i apologize for springing it on you at the last minute , but mr. benjamin and i are attending a celebration tonight , and we would be most pleased if you chose to accompany us . is n't that right , mr. benjamin ?	absolutely . we would be honored .
it 's 1942 , right ? and he 's caught in leningrad during the siege . i 'm talking about one of the worst moments in human history . five hundred thousand people died in that one place , and there 's bakhtin , holed up in an apartment , expecting to be killed any day . he has plenty of tobacco , but no paper to roll it in . so he takes the pages of a manuscript he 's been working on for ten years and tears them up to roll his cigarettes .	his only copy ?
his only copy . i mean , if you think you 're going to die , what 's more important , a good book or a good smoke ? and so he huffed and he puffed , and little by little he smoked his book .	nice try . you had me going for a second , but no ... no writer would ever do a thing like that . would he ?
i do n't know .	is it yours ?
yeah , it might be .	here , catch .
so you 're saying it was n't like that at all .	not exactly . i mean , there was more to it than i told you .
christ . you did n't just see what happened . they dropped the package on the ground and you picked it up .	yeah , i picked it up .
and started to run .	and started to run .
good thinking .	that 's just it . i did n't think . i just did it .
you have one hell of a knack for getting into trouble , do n't you ? so how much does it come to ?	six thousand dollars . five thousand eight hundred and fourteen dollars , to be exact .
so you robbed the robbers , and now the robbers are after you .	that 's it . in a nutshell .
yeah , well , you have to be nuts to do what you did . if you want my opinion , you should give this money back to the creeper . just give it back and tell him you 're sorry .	no way . there 's no way i 'm giving that money back . it 's my money now .
a lot of good it will do you if the creeper finds you .	that money is my whole future .
so you lost the job . is that what you 're telling me ? he just up and fired you ?	it was more complicated than that . there was a reason .
well ?	it was n't my fault .
if you do n't tell me what happened , how do you expect me to know that ? i need facts , not opinions .	the water was dripping , see ... i turned it off , but it was still dripping , and then auggie had to go out , and so i left the back room ... and later on ... well , later on ... when auggie came back ... the whole place was flooded . his cuban cigars got all messed up ... you know , soaked through ... just when he was about to sell them ... to these rich guys in suits ... .
cuban cigars . you mean he had some hanky-panky going with those guys ?	i suppose so . he never told me about it .
no wonder he was angry .	he was out five thousand bucks , he said ... . he kept saying it over and over ... . five thousand bucks down the drain ... . he would n't stop ... . five thousand bucks , five thousand bucks ... . he was like out of his mind with those five thousand bucks ... .
here 's what you 're going to do . you 're going to open up your backpack , take out your bag of money , count out five thousand dollars , and hand it over to auggie .	what are you talking about ? you ca n't be serious .
i 'm serious , all right . you 've got to square it with auggie . since you wo n't give the money back to the creeper , you can use it to make things right with auggie . that 's probably better anyway . better to keep your friends than to worry about your enemies .	i 'm not going to do it .
you 'll do it , all right . you fuck up , you 've got to undo the damage . that 's how it works , buster . if you do n't do it , i 'm going to throw you out of here . do you understand me ? if you do n't pay auggie what you owe him . i 'm finished with you .	i pay auggie , and i 've got nothing . eight hundred bucks and a ticket to shit city .
fuck you , too , you white son-of-a-bitch .	good . i 'm glad that 's settled !
hi , kid .	wow . they sure did a job on you .
we came here to deliver some clean laundry .	it 's all right . i really do know them .
if it does n't make any difference , why not just say it ?	i was going to tell him ... but in my own time . in my own time ... .
like it or not , cyrus , that 's my name . cole . just like yours .	now ask him who his mother was .
yeah , give him another one . and i 'll take a cup of coffee while you 're at it .	hot coffee or iced coffee ?
do you have real iced coffee , or do you just pour hot coffee over some ice cubes ?	everything is real in here , honey . as real as the color of my hair .
i 'll take the iced coffee . you only live once , right ?	if you 're lucky . then again , it depends on what you call living .
how do you want that cooked ?	medium rare , please .
fries ?	yes , please .
lettuce and tomato ?	yes , please .
do n't know how long it 's take to get a charge ...	keep it tonight . we 'll catch fish . i 'll see ya back on the docks ...
seven acres . i 'm wonderin ' what you 'd pay for 'em . just curious , is all .	what are you sellin ' 'em for ? why do n't we start there .
the battery 's in , that 's done with . besides , you 'd do the same for m ...	... < u > might < /u > do the same . i have to warn you 'bout that , chief . i 'm not screwed together like i used to be .
i am a bastard . i 'm a big hun nazi son of a bitch . and i still got your bamboo fishing rod .	oh , yeh ?
$ 1200 an acre , that 's what i paid ole , wo n't take a dime less . you got no choice on that .	did n't say i was buyin ' did i ? what you want down ? just bein ' curious , is all .
so the blood on the gaff was not fish blood at all . it was < u > human < /u > , yes ? type b positive .	carl heine 's type .
but you ca n't say with any certainty that the blood was his .	no , but as i say , the type is rare . ten percent of caucasian males .
and the blood could < u > not < /u > have belonged to defendant . seeing that his type is o negative .	that 's obvious .
bits of blood and wood . what else would there be ?	no bits of bone , no particles of scalp , no strands of hair ?
none .	well , if the blood got < u > onto < /u > the gaff by crushing a man 's skull ...
i do n't know .	you do n't .
with no bone or scalp or hair present . would it be more probable that the blood came from crushing a man 's skull ...	i 'm a hemotologist , not a detective .
him and his folks and two brothers and two sisters worked our land . lived in a picker 's cabin at first .	so the defendant knew the deceased , your son , even then .
but back in '34 , japanese-born could not < u > own < /u > land . so ... ?	carl held it < u > for < /u > 'em . called it a lease . they make payments every june and december ...
why ? if they could never take title .	their kids was born here . so when the oldest , that one there , was twenty ... last payment gets made , and he could own it .
now defendant 's father had also died by that point . where was the defendant ? when you sent his family their equity .	in the war . europe , i believe . they could hardly send him to the pacific , could they ?
and when he came home . did he write you about this ? or phone , perhaps .	just showed up at my door , big as life and twice as mean . wanted to talk to my son .
what do you mean by 'dirty looks ' ?	well . every time i see him in town or somewhere , he 's starin ' at me with these narrow eyes . givin ' me his mean face .
when your son came back from the war , what did he say about all this ?	that he 'd keep an eye on miyamoto . watch out for him .
just three questions . the miyamoto family bought your seven acres for $ 4500 ?	tried to . defaulted on their payments .
second question . what did ole jurgensen pay you per acre ?	a thousand .
so that makes what would have been $ 4500 into $ 7000 , does n't it ? if you sent the equity back , you had a profit of $ 2500 .	is that your third question ?
it is .	you done your math right .
now , mister gi ...	unwritten rule of the sea . we do n't bother each other , stick to ourselves . ask anybody .
now if you wanted to kill a man . think you 'd try boarding against his will , and hitting him with a fishing gaff ?	it 's a joke . maneuver up to carl 's boat ? tie your lines fast ? come aboard ? all against carl 's will ? it 's the stupidest suggestion i ever heard of .
so the fishing gaff method would n't make sense ?	could n't get on the boat . i 'd just < u > shoot < /u > the feller . < u > then < /u > tie up , throw him inta th ' drink . and skip bein ' the first gill-netter in history to make a successful forced boarding .
now the sheriff believed that the d-6 battery in carl 's well was carl 's own spare . even though it was too large f ...	no sense to have < u > any < /u > at all. , even the right size . it 's like having an extra battery in the trunk of your car . nobody does .
boat has two batteries . lose one you run off the other til morning . carl musta lost both , so miyamoto there gave him one a his .	course , if carl lost both batteries , dead in the water , his radio would n't work . so how would he signal for help ?
compressed air horn , most likely . hope to god some man hears you in that fog .	all right , what if the defendant < u > heard < /u > ? so carl < u > let < /u > him aboard , to help . and < u > then < /u > the fishing gaff ?
you mean miyamoto followed him out there , and sucker-punched him ?	well , what if ?
thank you , mr. gillanders . thank you for coming down , in this cold weather .	well , it does seem mighty warm in here . specially for mr. hooks .
i said 'excited ' . not agitated , he was excited in the sense of being overjoyed .	you were ... overjoyed yourself , to hear the news ?
happy for him . and relieved .	so , then , you ... and your husband ... must have called friends , relatives , to tell them the amazing news . yes ?
we hear how carl ... passed away . only a few hours later .	your husband returned at , what , seven o'clock ?
closer to eight .	so , five hours . plenty of time for a call . he was 'excited ' , you say . in the sense of being 'overjoyed ' .
you thought the deceased might ... break his promise ?	of course not . we 're just not quick to run and boast . in case something went wrong .
yes , and then , what was there to call about ? everything was up in the air .	up in the air ? was < u > that < /u > your reaction ?
we discussed that . and decided not to .	why not ?
because the facts could be misconstrued as murder .	but if truth was on your side , whatever were you worried about ?
trials are n't only about truth , mr. hooks . even though they should be . they 're about what people < u > believe < /u > is true .	so you hid the truth . deliberately .
we were afraid . silence seemed better . to come forward seemed like a mistake .	well , it seems to me ...
does n't it seem to < u > you < /u > , mrs. miyamoto , that your mistake was in being deceitful ? concealing information during the course of a sheriff 's investigation .	it seems human . to me .
question withdrawn , you may step down .	you 're implying th ...
he 's still got a good grip . we need to dig more .	at school , she kept mostly to the japanese kids , and sort of ignored me . as if all of our times alone together ... in the hollow cedar , everywhere ... were a secret .
i told myself that was good . that it made our friendship special . and did n't mean she was ashamed of it . necessarily .	easy . slow is best .
the best part was that there was a 'this ' . to debate the wrongness of .	your friends would . your dad would kill me with a machete .
my mom . would be the problem .	why ? we 're only talking .
i can just feel my spirits soar .	well , i do n't do it for just anybody .
there ca n't be any wrong in this , ha ...	i lie to my parents every day . and every night .
my father ca n't get our money from the bank . we have a few dol ...	it 'll be over soon . i can get you money .
it 's just pearl harbor . people are a little crazy , right n ...	look at my face . it 's the face of the people who did that . my father hardly speaks english . we 're in bad trouble , you have to see that .
we all expect the world to be fair . as if we have some right t ...	i do n't mean everyone . just people who can do things because they can arrest people or convict them . or run a newspaper .

i 'm married , ishmael . it is n't right for us to be alone . people will t ...	there 's no one here , and i 've < u > got < /u > to talk to you .
you have to hear this , i can never touch you , ishmael . not once , not ever . there 's no half- way . as much as i know it hurts you , you have to let this go .	look , i < u > want < /u > to forget you , i do . i think if you hold me , just this once , i can walk away and never speak to you again .
did you write that column ?	i did . but the jury wo n't s ...
you do n't believe in god anymore .	agnostics do n't believe or disbelieve , ma . we just do n't pretend we know .
i felt milholland 's report in my pocket . and wondered why i was n't telling her . telling someone . what i 'd found .	you 've been busy with that trial , i suppose . such a travesty ...
they only arrested that poor soul because he 's japanese .	seattle boys think he 's guilty . they say the evidence is rock solid .
they 're not his neighbor , like you are . he is a husband , a father , he risked his < u > life < /u > for < u > their < /u > country . the same as you .	those are n't the facts that matter .
your father fought at belleau wood , it took him years to get over it . nightmares , tears , b ...	... but he found you .
they were japanese-american boys , yes sir .	and you were generally experienced in training men for hand-to-hand combat .
it was my specialty , sir , i trained several thousand over the years .	so . wide cross-section of men to evaluate . and the day that the defendant volunteered for this ... demonstration . did you find him eager ?
well , what then , sergeant ?	what else ? i had the boy teach me kendo . including ... the importance of the bow .
and your evaluation of the defendant ? could he kill a much larger man with a fishing gaff ? so quickly , there would be no sign of struggle ?	oh , in a heartbeat .
and you were n't there , when the coroner examined the wound .	nossir . i 'd gone to tell the wid ... to tell mrs. heine .
so , no ... immediate suspicion , no ... general talk of enmity between the two .	these are fishermen , alvin . they do n't talk at all to each other and less to me . specially gossip .
... comes off third cleat from the stern , port side . and it 's brand new . unlike the rest .	and the next one ... ?
from carl heine 's boat . all his were like this one , three-strand manila , new condition , braided in loops . not bowlined like miyamoto 's .	and the last ... ?
so if defendant had tied up to deceased 's boat . with that last one . would those cleats have lined up ?	you bet . and if miyamoto there had been in a hurry to cast off , he coulda left this line behind on carl 's boat .
and replaced it later with the new one . that 's your inference ?	pretty darn clear .
... so when the sheriff returned , you showed him the injury to the deceased 's head .	he said , 'could it be somebody hit him ? ' and i said , 'you want to play sherlock holmes , here ? '
did you say more ?	i said that if i was playing sherlock holmes ... i 'd maybe look for a ... japanese person . with a bloody gun- butt . a right-handed fella , to be precise .
well , i was a doctor in the jap theater , in the war . i saw those kendo wounds , < u > many < /u > times . looked exactly like this one .	could you tell me what 'kendo ' is ?
as peculiar as a struggle between a 235 pound man , and an assailant strong enough to subdue him ... that leaves only a < u > single < /u > overturned < u > cup < /u > in its wake ?	objection , asking the witness to speculate .
objection . asking witness to speculate about deceased 's state of mind .	all right . what did your son < u > say < /u > to that effect ?
you 're a hard man to trust , sir . you sit before us , with no expression , keeping a poker f ...	objection !
your honor , < u > all < /u > of this is speculation . including mr. hooks ' dramaturgy about the defendant issuing a false distress call .	tht was summation , your h ...
maybe it went . where carl went . over the side .	objection ! speculation .
< u > everything < /u > had to happen < u > just < /u > right . for your little story to fly . i mean , a blond hair could be on that gunnel for a < u > lot < /u > of reasons .	i 'm sorry , was there a question in there ?
well , the freighter . the twine . the blood . the knife . the cup . the watch . the second battery . the phantom lantern . the fishing gaff . the cracked gunnel . the skull wound . the blond hair . that 's < u > eleven < /u > things ...	twelve .
and since you confess this is all pure guesswork . what is your expertise , sir , are you a detective of sorts ?	my expertise . is that i 'm a journalist .
then putting them together . so truth is revealed .	but is n't the < u > truth < /u > that there are < u > several < /u > other ways to explain < u > each < /u > of these twelve pieces .
your line of work . you must meet a lot of men play fast and loose with the truth .	like you could n't believe .
greedy .	he did n't want to lose any more .
i asked you a question , you 're writing a tract , h ...	that 's how journalists . answer questions .
and i would n't blame these good people if they were a mite resent- ful . at a tactic that insults their intelligence .	that 's curious . i was < u > appealing < /u > to their intelligence .
< u > were < /u > you , sir ? can you < u > prove < /u > one word of all your fancy story ?	no , sir , i ca n't . not beyond a reasonable doubt .
robbed . he was angry .	oh , yeh . he said someday he would get his land back .
mr. jurgensen . did he offer to < u > buy < /u > the seven acres from you ?	oh , yeh . but this is nine year ago , i had my healt , i was n't wantin ' to sell .
and then your stroke came this summer . and you put your property on the market , i believe you said september 7. which , remember , is < u > eight < /u > days before carl heine died . and who comes spetember 7 , wanting to buy ?	carl heine came .
but carl was a fisherman . and successful at it .	he said he did n't want that life no more . he 'd been saving to buy a farm . he was sorry i got sick . but pretty excited to get back his father 's place .
as my wife testified , we were considering it .	actually , she said you had decided . decided < u > not < /u > not come forward .
sheriff said right off , i was under suspicion . i did n't have a lawyer ...	but even < u > after < /u > you had an attorney . you still claimed to know < u > nothing < /u > . claimed < u > not < /u > to have seen carl . am i correct ?
yes . initially .	well , 'initially ' is an interesting word , sir . you 'd < u > been < /u > arrested , you < u > had < /u > a lawyer , and you < u > still < /u > claimed ignorance !
i should have told everything right away . i know that now , and i regret it .	should have told 'everything ' . meaning , you should have told the < u > truth < /u > .
my apologies . do you regret not telling the truth ?	i have told the truth .
i see . now what happened the day carl heine was found ? before your arrest .	i slept til one-thirty , when my wife woke me up with the news . we talked for a few hours . i left at six and went straight to my boat .
did n't go anywhere else ? no errands , no purchases ? just straight to the boat . that 's the truth .	yes .
well , the sheriff found < u > two < /u > batteries in your well . if you left one with carl heine , how is that possible ?	i had a spare battery in my shed . i brought it down , and put it in just before the sheriff showed up .
you have the night watch ? on the radio .	since september . last guys got transferred .
and you keep the records , or contribute to 'em .	shorthard the radio transmis- sions , write 'em up , file 'em in a cabinet . nobody ever looks . just take up space .
how long you have this detail ?	me and smoltz came on dogwatch september 16 .
you mean , early morning the 16th ?	no , night of the 16th , morning the 17th . we replaced two guys named miller and milholland .
they got transferred that day . out to cape flattery .	some seaman 's loast report . stuffed in a cabinet , good as lost forever . no one knows .
i did . boy .	three kids . what 's she going to do ?
you said three minutes .	wo n't take two .
never shoulda given you that inventory in the first place .	it 's public record . if the public cares enough to read it .
here now , what are you fixin ' to do ?	have a look . at nothing .
you gon na climb that with one arm ?	you 're right . i better use two .
it 's on the twine , too . but it 's not r ...	do n't prove there was two lanterns . coulda been the one in the cabin .
it 's the way it happened , i know it is .	no , you do n't .
this tastes horrible , hmmn ?	you 're wondering why i held it .
your daddy . was quite a feller .	yes , he was .
he 's looking down . and he 's not thinking 'bout the man you were yesterday . he 's proud of the man you are tonight . that 's what counts .	to my father . everything counts .
tell us why that lantern would be so significant .	well . it shows the prosecutor was wrong . it was < u > carl 's < /u > boat that was dead in the water . or he 'd never have put up the lantern .
now you believe there were < u > two < /u > lanterns when defendant arrived . one in carl 's hand . the second lashed to the mast .	that 's what mr. miyamoto reported , and he 'd have no reason to lie . he could n't know that it would help his case .
well , why does it ?	because the second lantern , the one on the mast . was never found . so we have to ask ...
that 's when he fell .	fell .
miyamoto gave him the battery , and left . carl 's boat was running , he goes back to fishing . but at some point , he thinks of the lantern ...	still lashed to the mast .
he figures a perfectly good lantern could get banged around up there . so he climbs up . to cut it down .	just as the freighter comes through ? is n't that quite a coincidence ?
coincidences happen . you run a yellow light < u > just < /u > as a car comes out of nowhere . split-second tragedy happens every day . or maybe ...	maybe ... ?
maybe carl picks up something about the freighter on his radio , which is now working . same report milholland heard . and < u > that < /u > makes him get the lantern fast . before the freighter 's wake can bang it around .	but you < u > could < /u > be wrong . he < u > could < /u > have climbed up earlier .
then where 's the lantern ? and where 's the knife ?	the knife . what knife ?
still a coincidence . timing and all .	the freighter started through at 1:42. the sea water seeped into carl 's watch and stopped it . at 1:47 .
still and all . carl was a strong swimmer , he m ...	he hit his head . on the way in .
you think so ?	the sheriff and the deputy and i inspected the deck closely . we found a small fracture in the wood of the gunnel . just below the mast .
cigarette ?	i 'll take two . one for later .
if i whistle . those boys 'll see you , and come runnin ' . < u > you 're < /u > the story today .	you ever been strangled by a single hand ?
we do n't let go , you s ...	it 's a rare thing . takes a turning point .
what for , sheriff ?	we have a warrant . to search your boat .
you always run with the well open ?	i was checking the cables .
see you replaced a mooring line , lately . this one 's new .	naw , i had that around for a while .
you gaff with the < u > hook < /u > end . blood 's on the butt . where your hand goes .	sure . blood gets all < u > over < /u > your hand , sheriff , ask any fisherman .
sheriff , i ca n't afford not to fish toni ...	look , no way i 'm lettin ' you out there . in a half hour you could be in canada .
what makes you think i play ?	your daddy played . i asked , down at the japanese community center . you smoke cigars ?
white or black ?	you mean , do i like to take the offensive ? or hang back and wait .
you must think i like losing .	i think you like learning .
bet there 's a few things you could teach me . kendo , for one .	sure . i could take a fishing gaff and split your head open . right above your left ear .
you would n't even see it move .	you 're wonderin ' ... how come i never ask . if you did it .
now this jury is gon na be lookin ' at the evidence with one eye . and at you with the oth ...	mr. gudmundsson , we < u > know < /u > what that jury is looking at .
so every time you think about showing that jury strength . or honor or composure . or dignity .	i should show them an american ?
and what 's that ?	that you came upon carl by accident . like you said . gave him the battery . like you said . asked him about the seven acres . like you said .
i 'm more a hot-blooded killer , huh ? like a soldier . like a samurai .	you wo n't hear that from hooks . because the charge is < u > first < /u > -degree murder , which requires premeditation . he ca n't change the charge .
you want me to say that .	i want you . to tell the truth .
you think that < u > is < /u > the truth .	i told your wife . trials are n't always so much about actual truth . as about what folks < u > believe < /u > is true . that 's sad . and it 's real .
maybe the assailant straightened the cabin . and forgot the cup .	right . in the middle . of the floor .
i think you testified < u > all < /u > the lights were on . cabin , mast , net lights , picking lights ...	yessir , there 'd been real heavy fog .
and yet you started the engine right up . with all those lights drawing all night , the batteries had that much charge . did that strike you odd ?	did n't think about it at the time . so no , it did n't strike me odd .
does it now ?	a little . yes . you have to wonder .
you found three batteries , you say . a d-6 and d-8 in the well . and a spare d-8 on the cabin floor . correct ?	it is .
now i did some measuring down at the chandlery . a d-6 is one inch wider than a d-8 . it would be too large for the deceased 's well .	he 's done some on-the-spot refit- ting . you could see the side flange was banged away to make room for the d-6 .
but he had a spare d-6 , you said . right there . why not use that ?	it was dead . we had it tested . maybe the d-6 was the spare and he had to use it .
sheriff , how many batteries and what size did you find on < u > defendant 's < /u > boat ?	two d-6 's . that 's the kind his well was fitted for .
no spare .	no .
so the defendant went out fishing for the night with < u > no < /u > spare battery , hmmn ?	apparently .
i believe so .	now you 've testified that the deceased was a heavy man , and hard to bring out of the net .
is it possible his head struck the transom , or the stern gunnel , or the net roller , as you were bringing him in ?	i do n't think so .
you do n't . < u > think < /u > so .	he was heavy , but we were real careful . but i do n't remember him hitting anything , anywhere .
operating this winch you 'd rarely operated before , doing this awkward job of bringing in a drowned man of 235 pounds ... is it < u > possible < /u > . possible that he struck his head < u > after < /u > death . possible ?	possible . but not darn likely .
how < u > is < /u > your mother-in-law ?	she 's alright , nels , thanks for asking .
and her farmhouse ... ?	the damage was considerable . but she 's insured . thanks , again .
one d-6 and one d-8 in the well . and a dead d-8 on the deck .	which you inferred was replaced by the d-6 , which must have been a spare .
what else could it be ?	even though a d-6 is too big , and the flange had to be banged out to squeeze it in . which makes it a peculiar choice . for a spare .
so this ... foam you found in the lungs . how does it get there ?	as i testified . it occurs when water , mucus and air are mixed by respiration . i believe i said that .
that 's < u > why < /u > the autopsy report identifies < u > drowning < /u > as the cause of death .	meaning that he was n't murdered first , say on the deck of the boat , and then thrown overboard .
well ...	your report says death by < u > drowning < /u > , which means he went into the water alive and breathing . and the report is accurate ... ?
in your motorcycle example . those injuries are produced by the head being propelled < u > against < /u > an object . rather than the reverse , yes ?	obviously .
can you tell whether an object moved against the head , or the other way around ? or would both look the same .	the same .
so if his head struck something narrow and flat , the gunnel of a boat , a net roller , a fairlead , could that have ...	if the head was moving fast enough , but i do n't see how it could be .
is it possible ?	sure , anything 's poss ...
is it fair to say that you do not know for < u > certain < /u > which it was .	i already said that , b ...
for certain , no .	but you are < u > certain < /u > that he died by drowning .
can i say something , here ?	yes , you can tell me about the minor cut you found on the deceased 's right hand . the report says 'recent origin ' . how recent ? as much as 24 hours before death ?
are you absol ...	< u > yes < /u > , i 'm sure .
so your husband said he 's think it over . encouraged mr. miyamoto to believe he might sell to h ...	i would n't say encouraged .
well , he did n't say 'no ' , did he ? did n't say no hope existed .	not in those words .
i guess you 'd have to guess . not having been there with them . having to guess whether your husband 's report was word for word accurate .	carl never lied .
those 'dirty looks ' . defendant ever aim one of those at you ?	he had no reason to .
carl ever say < u > he < /u > got one ?	i ca n't speak for him .
sorry about that , mrs. heine . shall i repeat the ques ...	carl said he did n't like kabuo much anymore .
the question is more about the < u > defendant 's < /u > attitu ...	that 's all he said .
improved ... how ?	as i said , in every way . physically and psychologically . more endurance , quicker responses , better hand-eye , improved technical training . where the first psychology gave you ninety-eight percent obedience , this bunch gives you 99.4 .
... he used to say , `` if it ai n't broke , do n't fix it . ''	i ... see . i 'm not sure i quite get your ... point ...
well , the soldiers we 've got now , they 've been through all kinds of heavy shit ... and they 've always got the job done . now these new ones , these `` hot shots '' of yours ... what kind of action have they seen ? they < u > are < /u > battle-tested , are n't they ?	that 's up to you field guys . h.q . wants you to break 'em in when you do the annual security sweep in january .
the sweep is just routine , not even police action . i 'd like to see some sort of ... meaningful evidence ...	such as ?
melton , on the double ! up a chain ! melton sir ! melton takes a few easy strides , gracefully catches a chain mid- stride , and smarts up , climbing easily and twice as fast as todd . church , sloan , and rubrick crane their necks as the two men struggle upward toward the rafters . three quarters of the way up , melton comes even with todd , then passes him . mekum , watching , smirks . church is watching too , and he 's still not satisfied . his brow is knit , something 's bothering him . angle high above , among the girders stonefaced , melton is resting an a `` platform '' on the chain , sixty feet up , beneath the girders , swaying gently . his stony gaze is on the next chain where todd is arriving at a `` platform '' on an adjacent chain ... only three feet away . their eyes meet , todd and melton alone together sixty feet up , three feet apart . neither man blinks , neither man flinches , neither man reveals anything at all ... low angle , looking up church considers the men high above , then to mekum . church what about ... spirit ?	spirit ? oh ! you mean `` aq '' ... '' aggressive qualities '' ?
are these your bags ?	yes . and that one , too .
okay , doll .	i suppose you want a tip ?
forget it , doll . after all , you work here - i work here - and believe you me , it 's nice to have you with the organization .	bye .
listen , doll - what time do you get off tonight ?	why ?
because i 'm working the night shift - and i got a bottle of gin stashed away - and as soon as there 's a lull -	are n't you a little too young for that , sonny ?
wan na see my driver 's license ?	get lost , will you ?
which of you dolls is daphne ?	bull fiddle .
it 's from satchel mouth at table seven . this is from me to you , doll .	beat it , buster .
those idiot broads ! here we are all packed to go to miami , and what happens ? the saxophone runs off with a bible salesman , and the bass fiddle gets herself pregnant . i ought to fire you , bienstock .	me ? i 'm the manager of the band - not the night watchman .
hi , mary lou - rosella - okay , dolores , get a move on - how 's your back , olga ?	clarinet - drums - trumpet - trombone -
yes , sue ? what is it ?	i thought i made it clear i do n't want any drinking in this outfit .
i beg your pardon .	all right , girls - from the top again .
you know , bienstock , there 's something funny about those two new girls .	funny ? in what way ?
you 're in berths 7 and 7a .	thank you ever so .
you 're welcome .	it 's entirely mutual .
upsy-daisy .	fresh !
no -- - how does it go ?	now cut that out , girls-none of that rough talk . they went to a conservatory .
pardon me , mr. bienstock - can i have my flask back ?	
you girls have seen a brown bag with a white stripe and my initials ?	a what ?
this a private clambake , or can anybody join ?	it 's private . go away .
okay .	manhattans ? this time of night ?
- so the one-legged jockey said -	what did he say ?
cut it out , girls . stop it . joe - josephine - help !	hey , she 's ticklish !
say , boss - i been talking to some of the other delegates - and the word is that little bonaparte is real sore about what happened to toothpick charlie . him and charlie , they used to be choir boys together .	stop , or i 'll burst out crying .
he even got charlie 's last toothpick - the one from the garage - and had it gold-plated .	like i was telling you - little bonaparte is getting soft . he does n't have it here any more . used to be like a rock . too bad . i think it 's time for him to retire .
same faces - same instruments - - and here 's your valentine 's card .	those two musicians from the garage !
what happened ?	me and tiny , we had them cornered - but we lost 'em in the shuffle .
say , joe - tonight 's the night , is n't it ?	i 'll say .
i mean , we get paid tonight , do n't we ?	yeah . why ?
because i lost a filling in my back tooth . i got ta go to the dentist tomorrow .	dentist ? we been out of work for four months - and you want to blow your first week 's pay on your teeth ?
it 's just a little inlay - it does n't even have to be gold -	how can you be so selfish ? we owe back rent - we 're in four eighty-nine bucks to moe 's delicatessen - we 're being sued by three chinese lawyers because our check bounced at the laundry - we 've borrowed money from every girl in the line -
you 're right , joe .	of course i am .
first thing tomorrow we 're going to pay everybody a little something on account .	no we 're not .
we 're not ?	first thing tomorrow we 're going out to the dog track and put the whole bundle on greased lightning .
you 're going to bet my money on a dog ?	he 's a shoo-in . i got the word from max the waiter - his brother-in-law is the electrician who wires the rabbit -
what are you giving me with the rabbit ?	look at those odds - ten to one . if he wins , we can pay everybody .
but suppose he loses ?	what are you worried about ? this job is going to last a long time .
but suppose it does n't ?	jerry-boy - why do you have to paint everything so black ? suppose you get hit by a truck ? suppose the stock market crashes ?
suppose mary pickford divorces douglas fairbanks ?	hey , joe !
suppose lake michigan overflows ?	do n't look now - but the whole town is under water !
well , that solves one problem . we do n't have to worry about who to pay first .	quiet - i 'm thinking .
of course , the landlady is going to lock us out - moe said no more knackwurst on credit - and we ca n't borrow any more from the girls , because they 're on their way to jail -	shut up , will you ? i wonder how much sam the bookie will give up for our overcoats ?
sam the bookie ? nothing doing ! you 're not putting my overcoat on that dog !	i told you - it 's a sure thing .
but we 'll freeze - it 's below zero - we 'll catch pneumonia .	look , stupid , he 's ten to one . tomorrow , we 'll have twenty overcoats !
greased lightning ! why do i listen to you ? i ought to have my head examined !	i thought you were n't talking to me .
yeah - where were you ?	with you .
with me ?	do n't you remember ? he has this bad tooth - it got impacted - the whole jaw swole up -
it did ? boy , did it ever !	so i had to rush him to the hospital and give him a transfusion ... right ?
right . we have the same blood type ...	- type o .
nellie told us about it .	we 're not too late , are we ?
you mean it 's a girls ' band ?	yeah , that 's what he means . good old nellie ! i ought to wring her neck !
no . and he ai n't been eating so good , either . he 's got an empty stomach and it 's gone to his head .	but , joe - three weeks in florida ! we could borrow some clothes from the girls in the chorus -
you 've flipped your wig !	now you 're talking ! we pick up a couple of second-hand wigs - a little padding here and there - call ourselves josephine and geraldine -
all the way to urbana - for a one night stand ?	it 's twelve bucks . we can get one of the overcoats out of hock .
it 's a hundred miles , joe - it 's snowing - how are we going to get there ?	i 'll think of something . do n't crowd me .
we could 've had three weeks in florida - all expenses paid . lying around in the sun - palm trees - frying fish ...	knock it off , will you ?
we did n't see anything - - did we ?	no - nothing . besides , it 's none of our business if you guys want to knock each other off -
i think they got me .	they got the bull-fiddle .
you do n't see any blood ?	not yet . but if those guys catch us , there 'll be blood all over . type o .
where are we running , joe ?	as far away as possible .
you going to call the police ?	the police ? we 'd never live to testify . not against spats colombo . wabash 1098 .
we got to get out of town . maybe we ought to grow beards .	we are going out of town . but we 're going to shave .
shave ? at a time like this ? those guys got machine guns - they 're going to blast our heads off - and you want to shave ?	shave our legs , stupid .
how can they walk on these things ? how do they keep their balance ?	must be the way their weight is distributed . come on .
and it 's so drafty . they must be catching colds all the time .	quit stalling . we 'll miss the train .
i feel so naked . like everybody 's looking at me .	with those legs ? are you crazy ?
it 's no use . we 'll never get away with it , joe .	the name is josephine . and it was your idea in the first place .
who are we kidding ? look at that - look how she moves - it 's like jello on springs - they must have some sort of a built-in motor . i tell you it 's a whole different sex .	what are you afraid of ? nobody 's asking you to have a baby . this is just to get out of town . the minute we hit florida , we 'll blow this set-up .
my name is josephine .	and i 'm daphne .
daphne ?	i never did like the name geraldine .
hello , everybody . i 'm the bass fiddle . just call me daphne .	i 'm josephine . sax .
how about that talent ? this is like falling into a tub of butter .	watch it , daphne !
when i was a kid , i used to have a dream - i was locked up in this pastry shop overnight - with all kinds of goodies around - jelly rolls and mocha eclairs and sponge cake and boston cream pie and cherry tarts -	listen , stupe - no butter and no pastry . we 're on a diet !
not there - that 's the emergency brake .	now you 've done it !
done what ?	tore off one of my chests .
you 'd better go fix it .	you better come help me .
this way , daphne .	now you tore the other one .
i changed it . it used to be sugar kowalczyk .	polish ?
bye , sugar . we been playing with the wrong bands .	down , daphne !
forget it . one false move , and they 'll toss us off the train - there 'll be the police , and the papers , and the mob in chicago ...	boy , would i like to borrow a cup of that sugar .
look - no butter , no pastry , and no sugar !	you tore it again !
men ?	oh , you do n't have to worry about that .
steady , boy . just keep telling yourself you 're a girl .	i 'm a girl . i 'm a girl . i 'm a girl -
what are you doing ?	i just want to make sure that honey stays in the hive . there 'll be no buzzing around tonight .
but suppose i got to go - like for a drink of water ?	fight it .
but suppose i lose ? suppose it 's an emergency ?	then pull the emergency brake !
good night , daphne .	good night , josephine .
what 's going on here ? daphne - daphne -	it 's not my fault . i did n't invite them .
male and female - the moth and the flame - i ought to slug you !	you would n't hit a girl , would you ?
what happened ?	i got pinched in the elevator .
well , now you know how the other half lives .	and i 'm not even pretty .
they do n't care - just as long as you wear skirts . it 's like waving a red flat in front of a bull .	i 'm tired of being a flag . i want to be a bull again . lets get out of here , joe . let 's blow .
blow where ?	you promised - the minute we hit florida , we were going to beat it .
how can we ? we 're broke .	we can get a job with another band . a male band .
listen , stupid - right now spats colombo and his chums are looking for us in every male band in the country .	but this is so humiliating .
so you got pinched in the elevator . so what ? would you rather be picking lead out of your navel ?	all right , all right ! but how long can we keep this up ?
what 's the beef ? we 're sitting pretty . we get room and board - we get paid every week - there 's the palm trees and the flying fish -	what are you giving me with the flying fish ? i know why you want to stick around - you 're after sugar .
me ? after sugar ?	i watched you two on the bus - lovey-dovey - whispering and giggling and borrowing each other 's lipstick -
what are you talking about ? sugar and me , we 're just like sisters .	yeah ? well , i 'm your fairy godmother - and i 'm keeping an eye on you .
yeah - let her soak . come on .	do n't get burned , daphne .
what is it , young lady ? what are you staring at ?	you - you -
i heard a very sad story about a girl who went to bryn mawr . she squealed on her roommate , and they found her strangled with her own brassiere .	yes - you have to be very careful about picking a roommate .
he 's not only got a yacht , he 's got a bicycle .	daphne - go on - tell me all about him .
you know - the old shell game .	daphne , you 're bothering us .
wise guy , huh ? trying to louse me up -	and what are you trying to do to poor sugar ? putting on that millionaire act - and that phony accent - nobody talks like that ! i 've seen you pull some low tricks on dames - but this is the trickiest and the lowest and the meanest -
i 'm a push-over for whom ? what is it ? who 's on the phone ?	yes , mr. fielding - you 'll pick her up after the show in your motorboat - goodbye - what 's that you said ? oh - zowie ! i 'll give her the message .
what message ? what motorboat ?	you got it made , kid . fielding wants you to have a little cold pheasant with him on his yacht -
oh , he does !	just the three of you on that great big boat - you and him and rudy vallee .
fat chance ! you call him right back and tell him i 'm not going .	of course , you 're not . i 'm going .
you 're going to be on the boat with that dirty old man ?	no . i 'm going to be on that boat with sugar .
and where 's he going to be ?	he 's going to be ashore with you .
with me ?	that 's right .
daphne - your boy friend is waving at you .	you can both go take a flying jump .
come on , you can do better than that . give him teeth - the whole personality .	why do i let you talk me into these things ? why ?
because we 're pals - buddies - the two musketeers .	do n't give me the musketeers ! how 'm i going to keep the guy ashore ?
tell him you get seasick on a yacht . play miniature golf with him .	oh , no . i 'm not getting caught in a miniature sand trap with that guy .
what are you doing with my flowers ?	i 'm just borrowing them . you 'll get them back tomorrow .
hi , jerry . everything under control ?	have i got things to tell you !
what happened ?	i 'm engaged .
congratulations . who 's the lucky girl ?	i am .
what ?	osgood proposed to me . we 're planning a june wedding .
what are you talking about ? you ca n't marry osgood .	you think he 's too old for me ?
jerry ! you ca n't be serious !	why not ? he keeps marrying girls all the time !
but you 're not a girl . you 're a guy ! and why would a guy want to marry a guy ?	security .
jerry , you 'd better lie down . you 're not doing well .	look , stop treating me like a child . i 'm not stupid . i know there 's a problem .
i 'll say there is !	his mother - we need her approval . but i 'm not worried - because i do n't smoke .
jerry - there 's another problem .	like what ?
like what are you going to do on your honeymoon ?	we 've been discussing that . he wants to go to the riviera - but i sort of lean toward niagara falls .
you 're out of your mind ! how can you get away with this ?	oh , i do n't expect it to last . i 'll tell him the truth when the time comes .
like when ?	like right after the ceremony .
oh .	then we 'll get a quick annulment - he 'll make a nice settlement on me - i 'll have those alimony checks coming in every month -
jerry , listen to me - there are laws - conventions - it 's just not being done !	but joe - this may be my last chance to marry a millionaire !
look , jerry - take my advice - forget the whole thing - just keep telling yourself you 're a boy !	i 'm a boy - i 'm a boy - i wish i were dead - i 'm a boy - i 'm a boy - what am i going to do about my engagement present ?
hey - these are real diamonds .	naturally . you think my fiance is a bum ? now i guess i 'll have to give it back .
that 's some nerve !	daphne got a proposal tonight .
i feel like such a tramp - taking jewelry from a man under false pretenses .	get it while you 're young . and you better fix your lips . you want to look nice for osgood , do n't you ?
it 's just going to break his heart when he finds out i ca n't marry him .	so ? it 's going to break sugar 's heart when she finds out i 'm not a millionaire . that 's life . you ca n't make an omelette without breaking an egg .
what are you giving me with the omelette ?	nag , nag , nag . look , we got a yacht , we got a bracelet , you got osgood , i 've got sugar - we 're really cooking .
joe -	what ?
i tell you , joe , they 're on to us . they 're going to line us up against the wall and - eh-eh-eh-eh-eh - and then the police are going to find two dead dames , and they 're going to take us to the ladies ' morgue , and when they undress us - i tell you , joe , i 'm just going to die of shame .	shut up and keep packing .
not that , you idiot .	but they 're from osgood . he wanted me to wear them tonight .
joe , if we get out of this hotel alive , you know what we 're going to do ? we 're going to sell the bracelet , and grab a boat to south america and hide out in one of those banana republics - the way i figure is , if we eat nothing but bananas , we can live there for fifty years - maybe a hundred years - that is , if we get out of the hotel alive . did we forget anything ?	there 's our shaving stuff - and there 's sugar .
sugar ?	get me room 414 .
telephone call ? who 's got time for that ?	we ca n't just walk out on her without saying goodbye .
since when ? usually you leave 'em with nothing but a kick in the teeth .	that 's when i was a saxophone player . now i 'm a millionaire .
drop her a postcard . any minute now those gorillas may be up here -	hello , room 414 ? this is the ship-to-shore operator - i have a call for miss sugar cane .
hello , my dearest darling . so good to hear your voice again .	i may throw up .
i do n't know about the captain - but the navigator is getting his tail out of here .	yeah - lets shove off .
wait a minute - my bracelet . what happened to my bracelet ?	what do you mean , your bracelet ? it 's our bracelet .
all right . what happened to our bracelet ?	do n't worry . we did the right thing with it .
what did we do ? joe , you 're not pulling one of your old tricks .	no tricks , no mirrors , nothing up my sleeve . it 's on the level this time .
you crazy or something ? the place is crawling with mobsters - gangrene is setting in - and you 're making like diamond jim brady ! how are we going to get out of here ? how are we going to eat ?	we 'll walk . and if we have to , we 'll starve .
all right - so what do we do now ?	first thing we got to do is get out of these clothes .
did you hear that ?	yeah , but they 're not watching yachts . come on - you 're going to call osgood .
what 'll i tell him ?	tell him you 're going to elope with him .
elope ? but there are laws - conventions -	there 's a convention , all right . there 's also the ladies ' morgue .
it 's all fixed ! osgood is meeting us on the pier -	we 're not on the pier yet -
oh !	terribly sorry .
that 's us . i 'm daphne - and this is josephine .	i 'm sugar cane .
she sings , too .	i do n't really have much of a voice - but then it 's not much of a band , either . i 'm only with 'em because i 'm running away .
we 'll take a rain check .	i do n't want you to think that i 'm a drinker . i can stop any time i want to - only i do n't want to . especially when i 'm blue .
are my seams straight ?	i 'll say .
good night , sugar .	good night , honey .
oh - sugar !	i wanted to thank you for covering for me . you 're a real pal .
it 's nothing . i just think us girls should stick together .	if it had n't been for you , they would have kicked me off the train . i 'd be out there in the middle of nowhere , sitting on my ukulele .
it must be freezing outside . when i think of you - and your poor ukulele -	if there 's anything i can do for you -
and that 's one of them .	sssh . sweet sue .
i do n't want her to know we 're in cahoots .	we wo n't tell anybody - not even josephine .
i 'd better stay here till she goes back to sleep .	stay as long as you 'd like .
i 'm not crowding you , am i ?	no . it 's nice and cozy .
when i was a little girl , on cold nights like this , i used to crawl into bed with my sister . we 'd cuddle up under the covers , and pretend we were lost in a dark cave , and were trying to find out way out .	interesting .
anything wrong ?	no , no .
why you poor thing - you 're trembling all over .	that 's ridiculous .
and your head is hot .	that 's ridiculous .
and you 've got cold feet .	is n't that ridiculous ?
i 'm a girl , i 'm a girl , i 'm a girl -	what did you say ?
i 'm a very sick girl .	maybe i 'd better go before i catch something .
i 'm not that sick .	i have a very low resistance .
look , sugar , if you feel you 're coming down with something , the best thing is a shot of whiskey .	you got some ?
you all right ?	i 'm fine .
how 's the bottle ?	half-full .
i tell you - this is the only way to travel .	you better put on the lights . i ca n't see what i 'm doing .
no - no lights . we do n't want anyone to know we 're having a party .	i may spill something .
so spill it . spills , thrills , laughs , games - this may even turn out to be a surprise party .	what 's the surprise ?
uh-uh . not yet .	when ?
we better have a drink first .	here . this 'll put hair on your chest .
who needs vermouth ?	we have some bourbon - lets make manhattans .
and bring the cocktail shaker .	oh , sugar . you 're going to spoil my surprise .
not you , sugar .	i 'm just going to get some ice .
i 'll carry the instruments .	thank you , daphne .
here you are , sugar .	a bunch of us girls are going for a swim . want to come along ?
see ? she does n't have one either - you do n't ?	we 'll rent some at the bathhouse . how about you , josephine ?
oh , i have some suntan lotion .	she 'll rub it on me - and i 'll rub it on her - and we 'll rub it on each other - bye .
what do you think you 're doing ?	just a little trick i picked up in the elevator .
you know , daphne - i had no idea you were such a big girl .	you should have seen me before i went on a diet .
i mean , your shoulders - and your arms -	that 's from carrying around the bull fiddle .
but there 's one thing i envy you for .	what 's that ?
