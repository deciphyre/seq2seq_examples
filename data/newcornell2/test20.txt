i 'm a what ?	or was it bryn mawr ?
oh , please do come . do n't disappoint us . it 'll be such fun . and bring your yacht .	come on , daphne .
well , i 'll be - ! how about that guy ?	now look , daphne - hands off - i saw him first .
sugar , dear - let me give you some advice . if i were a girl - and i am - i 'd watch my step .	if i 'd been watching my step , i never would have met him . wait till i tell josephine .
yeah - josephine .	will she be surprised . i just ca n't wait to see her face -
we do n't have to run .	oh yes , we do !
josephine -	i guess she 's not in here .
that 's funny . josie - i ca n't imagine where she can be .	well , i 'll come back later .
no , no , sugar - wait . i have a feeling she 's going to show up any minute .	believe it or not - josephine predicted the whole thing .
yeah . this is one for ripley .	do you suppose she went out shopping ?
oh , come on - you can do better than that .	i met one of them .
what do you mean , maybe ? i saw the way he looked at you . he 'll be there for sure .	i hope so .
no !	yes . he wants me to have supper with him - on his yacht - he 's going to pick me up at the pier .
no !	yes .
i thought i heard voices - and i just had to talk to somebody . i do n't feel like going to sleep .	i know what you need - a slug of bourbon .
did he get fresh ?	of course not . as a matter of fact , it was just the other way around . you see he needs help .
what for ?	and talk about elegant - you should see the yacht - candlelight - mint sauce and cranberries .
how did you get that bracelet ?	you like it ?
i always did .	junior gave it to me . it must have at least thirty stones -
thirty-four .	he 's going to south america to marry some other girl - that 's what they call high finance .
brand new .	this is our manager , mr. bienstock . i 'm sweet sue .
where did you girls play before ?	oh - here and there - and around .
how did those holes get there ?	oh - those . i do n't know . mice ?
did n't you girls say you went to a conservatory ?	yes . for a whole year .
i was it .	what 's the big idea ?
it 's about the florida job .	the florida job ?
what 's wrong with us ?	you 're the wrong shape . goodbye .
we could pass for that .	- you got to be blonde -
we could dye our hair .	- and you got to be girls .
yes , i 'm holding on .	wait a minute , joe . lets talk this over . why could n't we do it ? last year , when we played in that gypsy tearoom , we wore gold earrings . and you remember when you booked us with that hawaiian band ? grass skirts !
hello , mr. morris ? this is poliakoff , in chicago . say , you would n't have a couple of girl musicians available ? a sax player and a base ?	look , if william morris does n't come through -
just a moment , miss - may i ?	help yourself .
i am osgood fielding the third .	i am cinderella the second .
if there is one thing i admire , it 's a girl with a shapely ankle .	me too . bye now .
let me carry one of the instruments .	thank you . are n't you a sweetheart ?
it certainly is delightful to have some young blood around here .	personally , i 'm type o .
you know , i 've always been fascinated by show business .	you do n't say .
yes , indeed . it 's cost my family quite a bit of money .	you invest in shows ?
no - it 's showgirls . i 've been married seven or eight times .	you 're not sure ?
mama is keeping score . frankly , she 's getting rather annoyed with me	i 'm not surprised .
so this year , when george white 's scandals opened , she packed me off to florida . right now she thinks i 'm out there on my yacht - deep-sea fishing .	well , pull in your reel , mr. fielding . you 're barking up the wrong fish .
if i promise not to be a naughty boy - how about dinner tonight ?	sorry . i 'll be on the bandstand .
oh , of course . which of these instruments do you play ?	bull fiddle .
fascinating . do you use a bow or do you just pluck it ?	most of the time i slap it .
you must be quite a girl .	wan na bet ?
my last wife was an acrobatic dancer - you know , sort of a contortionist - she could smoke a cigarette while holding it between her toes - zowie ! - but mama broke it up .	why ?
goodbye , mr. fielding .	goodbye ?
this is where i get off .	oh , you do n't get off that easy .
please . it wo n't happen again .	no , thank you . i 'll walk .
but it 's such a waste - a full moon - an empty yacht -	i 'll throw up !
well , i 'll be - ! he does have a bicycle .	who ?
about that roadhouse -	they got a cuban band that 's the berries . why do n't we go there - blindfold the orchestra - and tango till dawn ?
you know something , mr. fielding ? you 're dynamite !	you 're a pretty hot little firecracker yourself .
daphne ...	yes , osgood ?
you 're leading again .	sorry .
this is my friend josephine - she 's going to be a bridesmaid .	pleased to meet you .
another bridesmaid ?	flower girl .
i called mama - she was so happy she cried - she wants you to have her wedding gown - it 's white lace .	osgood - i ca n't get married in your mother 's dress . she and i - we ' not built the same way .
we can have it altered .	oh , no you do n't ! look , osgood - i 'm going to level with you . we ca n't get married at all .
why not ?	well , to begin with , i 'm not a natural blonde .
it does n't matter .	and i smoke . i smoke all the time .
i do n't care .	and i have a terrible past . for three years now , i 've been living with a saxophone player .
i forgive you .	and i can never have children .
we 'll adopt some .	but you do n't understand ! i 'm a man !
this is her roommate . daphne ca n't talk right now . is it anything urgent ?	well , it is to me . will you give her a message ? i 'd like her to have a little supper with me on my yacht after the show tonight .
the new caledonia . that 's the name of it . the old caledonia went down during a wild party off cape hatteras . but tell her not to worry - this is going to be a quiet little midnight snack - just the two of us .	just the two of you ? what about the crew ?
oh , that 's all taken care of . i 'm giving them shore leave . we 'll have a little cold pheasant - and champagne - and i checked with the coast guard - there 'll be a full moon tonight - oh , and tell her i got a new batch of rudy vallee records -	that 's good thinking . daphne 's a push-over for him .
do n't i know you two from somewhere ?	we 're just a couple of musicians - we come to pick up a car - nellie weinmeyer 's car - there 's a dance tonight - come on , jerry .
wait a minute . where do you think you 're going ?	to urbana . it 's a hundred miles .
i do n't like no witnesses .	we wo n't breathe a word .
i do n't mean to be forward - but ai n't i had the pleasure of meeting you two broads before ?	oh , no !
anything today ?	oh , it 's you ! you got a lot of nerve -
now look , nellie - if it 's about last saturday night - i can explain everything .	what a heel ! i spend four dollars to get my hair marcelled , i buy me a new negligee , i bake him a great big pizza pie ... - and where were you ?
oh ?	nellie baby , i 'll make it up to you .
you 're making it up pretty good so far .	the minute we get a job , i 'm going to take you out to the swellest restaurant -
what 's the job ?	it 's three weeks in florida -
please , jerry - that 's no way to talk . nellie baby - what are you doing tonight ?	why ?
because i got some plans -	i 'm not doing anything . i just thought i 'd go home and have some cold pizza -
and you 'll be in all evening ?	yes , joe .
good ! then you wo n't be needing your car .	my car ? why , you -
hey , sig - can we talk to you ?	nellie , get me long distance . what is it ?
what are you - a couple of comedians ? get out of here ! long distance ? get me the william morris agency in new york .	you need a bass and a sax , do n't you ?
the wrong shape ? you looking for hunchbacks or something ?	it 's not the backs that worry me .
what kind of band is this , anyway ?	you got to be under twenty-five -
no , we could n't !	william morris !
look , if you boys want to pick up a little money tonight - at the university of illinois they are having - you should excuse the expression - a st. valentine 's dance .	we 'll take it !
well , here we are .	you two from the poliakoff agency ?
hey , sheboygan - you two - what was your last job - playing square dances ?	no - funerals .
we got it second-hand .	all right - lets take it from the top . and put a little heat under it , will you ?
we got time off for good behavior .	there are two things i will not put up with during working hours . one is liquor - and the other one is men .
tell what ?	if they catch me once more , they 'll boot me out of the band . you the replacement for the bass and the sax ?
yes . i come from a very musical family . my mother is a piano teacher and my father was a conductor .	where did he conduct ?
on the baltimore and ohio .	oh .
running away ? from what ?	do n't get me started on that . want a drink ? it 's bourbon .
we understand .	all the girls drink - but i 'm the one that gets caught . that 's the story of my life . i always get the fuzzy end of the lollipop .
put it here .	sugar , you 're going to get yourself into a lot of trouble .
if bienstock catches you again - what 's the matter with you , anyway ?	i 'm not very bright , i guess .
i would n't say that . careless , maybe .	no , just dumb . if i had any brains , i would n't be on this crummy train with this crummy girls ' band .
then why did you take this job ?	i used to sing with male bands . but i ca n't afford it any more .
afford it ?	have you ever been with a male band ?
me ?	that 's what i 'm running away from . i worked with six different ones in the last two years . oh , brother !
rough ?	i 'll say .
you ca n't trust those guys .	i ca n't trust myself . the moment i 'd start with a new band - bingo !
bingo ?	you see , i have this thing about saxophone players .
really ?	especially tenor sax . i do n't know what it is , but they just curdle me . all they have to do is play eight bars of `` come to me my melancholy baby '' - and my spine turns to custard , and i get goose-pimply all over - and i come to them .
that so ?	every time !
you know - i play tenor sax .	but you 're a girl , thank goodness .
yeah .	that 's why i joined this band . safety first . anything to get away from those bums .
yeah .	you do n't know what they 're like . you fall for them and you love 'em - you think it 's going to be the biggest thing since the graf zeppelin - and the next thing you know they 're borrowing money from you and spending it on other dames and betting on the horses -
you do n't say ?	then one morning you wake up and the saxophone is gone and the guy is gone , and all that 's left behind is a pair of old socks and a tube of toothpaste , all squeezed out .
men !	so you pull yourself together and you go on to the next job , and the next saxophone player , and it 's the same thing all over again . see what i mean ? - not very bright .
brains are n't everything .	i can tell you one thing - it 's not going to happen to me again . ever . i 'm tired of getting the fuzzy end of the lollipop .
you know i 'm going to be twenty-five in june ?	you are ?
that 's a quarter of a century . makes a girl think .	about what ?
about the future . you know - like a husband ? that 's why i 'm glad we 're going to florida .	what 's in florida ?
millionaires . flocks of them . they all go south for the winter . like birds .	going to catch yourself a rich bird ?
oh , i do n't care how rich he is - as long as he has a yacht and his own private railroad car and his own toothpaste .	you 're entitled .
maybe you 'll meet one too , josephine .	yeah . with money like rockefeller , and shoulders like johnny weismuller -
i want mine to wear glasses .	glasses ?
men who wear glasses are so much more gentle and sweet and helpless . have n't you ever noticed ?	well , now that you 've mentioned it -
happy days .	i hope this time you wind up with the sweet end of the lollipop .
what 's happened ?	search me . i mean - i 'll see .
okay , sugar - all clear . you better go back to bed .	i might as well stay in there . i wo n't be able to sleep anyway .
why not ?	bienstock . he snores to beat the band . we cut cards to see who sleeps over him , and i always lose . would n't you know ?
want to switch berths with me ?	would you mind terribly ?
thanks , honey .	good night , sugar .
well , there they are - more millionaires than you can shake a stick at .	i 'll bet there is n't one of them under seventy-five .
i wish they 'd put us in the same room .	so do i. but do n't worry - we 'll be seeing a lot of each other .
414 - that 's the same room number i had in cincinnati - my last time around with a male band . what a heel he was .	saxophone player ?
what else ? and was i ever crazy about him . two in the morning , he sent me down for knackwurst and potato salad - they were out of potato salad , so i brought coleslaw - so he threw it right in my face .	forget it , sugar , will you ? forget about saxophone players . you 're going to meet a millionaire - a young one .
what makes you so sure ?	just my feminine intuition .
wait a minute , daphne . you have n't got a bathing suit .	she does n't need one . i do n't have one either .
oh , i 'm terribly sorry .	my fault .
you 're not hurt , are you ?	i do n't think so .
i wish you 'd make sure .	why ?
because usually , when people find out who i am , they get themselves a wheel chair and a shyster lawyer , and sue me for a quarter of a million dollars .	well , do n't worry . i wo n't sue you - no matter who you are .
thank you .	who are you ?
have n't i seen you somewhere before ?	not very likely .
are you staying at the hotel ?	not at all .
your face is familiar .	possible you saw it in a newspaper - or magazine - vanity fair -
that must be it .	would you mind moving just a little ? you 're blocking my view .
your view of what ?	they run up a red-and-white flag on the yacht when it 's time for cocktails .
which one is yours - the big one ?	certainly not . with all that unrest in the world , i do n't think anybody should have a yacht that sleeps more than twelve .
i quite agree . tell me , who runs up that flat - your wife ?	no , my flag steward .
and who mixes the cocktails - your wife ?	no , my cocktail steward . look , if you 're interested in whether i 'm married or not -
i 'm not interested at all .	well , i 'm not .
how 's the stock market ?	up , up , up .
i 'll bet just while we were talking , you made like a hundred thousand dollars .	could be . do you play the market ?
no - the ukulele . and i sing .	for your own amusement ?
well - a group of us are appearing at the hotel . sweet sue and her society syncopators .	you 're society girls ?
oh , yes . quite . you know - vassar , bryn mawr - we 're only doing this for a lark .	syncopators - does that mean you play that fast music - jazz ?
yeah . real hot .	oh . well , i guess some like it hot . but personally , i prefer classical music .
so do i. as a matter of fact , i spent three years at the sheboygan conservatory of music .	good school ! and your family does n't object to your career ?
they do indeed . daddy threatened to cut me off without a cent , but i do n't care . it was such a bore - coming-out parties , cotillions -	- inauguration balls -
- opening of the opera -	- riding to hounds -
- and always the same four hundred .	you know , it 's amazing we never ran into each other before . i 'm sure i would have remembered anybody as attractive as you .
you 're very kind . i 'll bet you 're also very gentle - and helpless -	i beg your pardon ?
you see , i have this theory about men with glasses .	what theory ?
maybe i 'll tell you when i know you a little better . what are you doing tonight ?	tonight ?
i thought you might like to come to the hotel and hear us play .	i 'd like to - but it may be rather difficult .
why ?	i only come ashore twice a day - when the tide goes out .
oh ?	it 's on the account of the shells . that 's my hobby .
you collect shells ?	yes . so did my father and my grandfather - we 've all had this passion for shells - that 's why we named the oil company after it .
shell oil ?	please - no names . just call me junior .
would you mind moving along , please ?	yes , you 're in the way . he 's waiting for a signal from his yacht .
well , i guess i 'd better go -	it 's been delightful meeting you both .
and you will come to hear us tonight ?	if it 's at all possible -
josephine .	oh , i did n't hear you come in .
the most wonderful thing happened -	what ?
guess !	they repealed prohibition ?
one of whom ?	shell oil , junior . he 's got millions - he 's got glasses - and he 's got a yacht .
well , he 's young and handsome and a bachelor - and he 's a real gentleman - not one of these grabbers .	maybe you 'd better go after him - if you do n't want to lose him .
oh , i 'm not going to let this one get away . he 's so cute - collects shells .	shells ? whatever for ?
anyway , you 're going to meet him tonight .	i am ?
i guess he 's not going to show up - it 's give minutes to one - you suppose he forgot ?	well , you know how those millionaires are . these came for you .
you heard her - yes .	oh , josephine - just imagine - me , sugar kowalczyk , from sandusky , ohio , on a millionaire 's yacht . if my mother could only see me now -
been waiting long ?	it 's not how long you wait - it 's who you 're waiting for .
thank you . and thank you for the flowers .	i wanted them to fly down some orchids from our greenhouse but all of long island is fogged in .
i seem to be out of gas .	it 's sort of funny - you being out of gas - i mean , shell oil and everything -
i just got this motorboat - it 's an experimental model .	looks like they 're on the wrong track .
do you mind riding backwards ? it may take a little longer -	it 's not how long it takes - it 's who 's taking you .
it looked so small from the beach - but when you 're on it , it 's more like a cruiser - or a destroyer .	just regulation size . we have three like this .
three ?	mother keeps hers in southampton - and dad took his to venezuela - the company is laying a new pipe line .
my dad is more interested in railroads . baltimore and ohio . which is the port and which is the starboard ?	well , that depends - on whether you 're coming or going - i mean , normally the aft is on the other side of the stern - and that 's the bridge - so you can get from one side of the boat to the other - how about a glass of champagne ?
love it . which way ?	yes - now let 's see - where do you suppose the steward set it up ?
oh , you have an upstairs and a downstairs .	yes - that 's our hurricane cellar .
oh - in here .	of course . on thursdays , they always serve me in the small salon .
it 's exquisite - like a floating mansion .	it 's all right for a bachelor .
what a beautiful fish .	caught him off cape hatteras .
what is it ?	oh - a member of the herring family .
a herring ? is n't it amazing how they get those big fish into those little glass jars ?	they shrink when they 're marinated .
champagne ?	i do n't mind if i do .
down the hatch - as we say at sea .	bon voyage .
look at all that silverware .	trophies . you know - skeet-shooing , dog-breeding , water polo ...
water polo - is n't that terribly dangerous ?	i 'll say . i had two ponies drowned under me .
where 's your shell collection ?	yea , of course . now where could they have put it ? on thursdays , i 'm sort of lost around here .
what 's on thursdays ?	it 's the crews ' night off .
you mean we 're alone on the boat ?	completely .
you know , i 've never been completely alone with a man before - in the middle of the night - in the middle of the ocean .	oh , it 's perfectly safe . we 're well anchored - the ship is in shipshape - and the coast guard promised to call me if there are any icebergs around .
it 's not the icebergs . but there are certain men who would try to take advantage of a situation like this .	you 're flattering me .
well , of course , i 'm sure you 're a gentleman .	oh , it 's not that . it 's just that i 'm - harmless .
harmless - how ?	well , i do n't know how to put it - but i have this thing about girls .
what thing ?	they just sort of leave me cold .
you mean - like frigid ?	it 's more like a mental block . when i 'm with girls , it does nothing to me .
have you tried ?	have i ? i 'm trying all the time .
see ? nothing .	nothing at all ?
complete washout .	that makes me feel just awful .
oh , it 's not your fault . it 's just that every now and then mother nature throws somebody a dirty curve . something goes wrong inside .	you mean you ca n't fall in love ?
not anymore . i was in love once - but i 'd rather not talk about it . how about a little cold pheasant ?	what happened ?
i do n't want to bore you .	oh , you could n't possibly .
well , it was my freshman year at princeton - there was this girl - her name was nellie - her father was vice-president of hupmobile - she wore glasses , too . that summer we spent our vacation at the grand canyon - we were standing on the highest ledge , watching the sunset - suddenly we had an impulse to kiss - i took off my glasses - i took a step toward her - she took a step toward me -	oh , no !
yes . eight hours later they brought her up by mule - i gave her three transfusions - we had the same blood type - type o - it was too late .	talk about sad .
ever since then - numb - no feelings . like my heart was shot full of novocaine .	you poor , poor boy .
yes - all the money in the world - but what good is it ? mint sauce or cranberries ?	how can you think about food at a time like this ?
what else is there for me ?	is it that hopeless ?
my family did everything they could - hired the most beautiful french upstairs maids - got a special tutor to read me all the books that were banned in boston - imported a whole troupe of balinese dancers with bells on their ankles and those long fingernails - what a waste of money !	have you ever tried american girls ?
is that anything ?	thanks just the same .
maybe if you saw a good doctor ...	i have . spent six months in vienna with professor freud - flat on my back - - then there were the mayo brothers - and injections and hypnosis and mineral baths - if i were n't such a coward , i 'd kill myself .
do n't talk like that . i 'm sure there must be some girl some place that could -	if i ever found a girl that could - i 'd marry her like that .
would you do me a favor ?	what is it ?
i may not be dr. freud or a mayo brother or one of those french upstairs girls - but could i take another crack at it ?	all right - if you insist .
anything this time ?	i 'm afraid not . terribly sorry .
would you like a little more champagne ? and maybe if we had some music - - how do you dim these lights ?	look , it 's terribly sweet of you to want to help out - but it 's no use . i think the light switch is over there - - and that 's the radio . it 's like taking somebody to a concert when he 's tone deaf .
you 're not giving yourself a chance . do n't fight it . relax .	it 's like smoking without inhaling .
well - ?	i 'm not quite sure . try it again .
i got a funny sensation in my toes - like somebody was barbecuing them over a slow flame .	lets throw another log on the fire .
i think you 're on the right track .	i must be - because your glasses are beginning to steam up .
i never knew it could be like this .	thank you .
they told me i was caputt - finished - washed up - and now you 're making a chump out of all those experts .	mineral baths - now really !
where did you learn to kiss like that ?	oh , you know - junior league - charity bazaars - i used to sell kisses for the milk fund .
good night .	good morning .
how much do i owe the milk fund so far ?	eight hundred and fifty thousand dollars .
oh , no . i 'm off that stuff - for good .	did you have a nice time ?
gee , i wish i 'd been there .	i 'm going to see him again tonight - and every night - i think he 's going to propose to me - as soon as he gets up his nerve .
really ?	from a rich millionaire .
that 's wonderful . poor josephine .	me ?
that 's funny - i never slept better . and i had the most wonderful dream . i was still on the yacht , and the anchor broke loose - and we drifted for days and days - you were the captain and i was the crew - i kept a lookout for icebergs , and i sorted your shells , and mixed your cocktails , and wiped the steam off your glasses - and when i woke up , i felt like swimming right back to you .	yes . now about our date for tonight ...
i 'll meet you on the pier again - right after the show .	i 'm afraid not . i ca n't make it tonight .
tomorrow night ?	not tomorrow , either . you see , i have to leave - something unexpected came up - i 'm sailing right away .
where to ? south america ? oh . that is unexpected .	you see , we have those oil interests in venezuela - and i just got a cable from dad - the board of directors decided on a merger .
a merger ? how long will you be gone ?	quite a while . as a matter of fact , i 'm not coming back at all .
you 're not ?	it 's all rather complicated - what we call high finance - but it so happens that the president of the venezuelan syndicate has a daughter , and -
oh - that kind of a merger . is she young ? pretty ?	according to our tax advisers , she 's only so-so . but - that 's the way the oil gushes . a man in my position has a certain responsibility to the stockholders - all those little people who invest their life savings -
oh , of course . i understand . at least , i think i do .	i knew you would .
i only wish there were something i could do for you .	but you have . you 've given me all that inside information - first thing tomorrow i 'm going to call my broker and have him buy fifty thousand shares of venezuelan oil .
yes , they 're here . oh - white orchids . would you believe it - i have n't had white orchids since i was a debutante . what 's this ?	what 's what ? oh , that . just a little going away present .
real diamonds . they must be worth their weight in gold . are you always this generous ?	not always . but i want you to know i 'm very grateful for what you did for me .
oh . the navigator just came in - we 're ready to cast off .	well , anchors aweigh , you have a bon voyage . and if you need an orchestra to play at your wedding , we 'll be through here in a couple of weeks .
what 's the matter , sugar ?	i do n't know . all of a sudden , i 'm thirsty .
daphne -	he was the first nice guy i ever met in my life - and the only one who ever gave me anything .
you 'll forget him , sugar .	how can i ? no matter where i go , there 'll always be a shell station on the corner . i 'll bring this back when it 's empty .
sugar ! what do you think you 're doing ?	i told you - i 'm not very bright .
you do n't want me , sugar - i 'm a liar and a phony - a saxophone player - one of those no-goodnicks you 've been running away from -	i know . every time !
do yourself a favor - go back where the millionaires are - the sweet end of the lollipop - not the cole slaw in the face and the old socks and the squeezed-out tube of toothpaste -	that 's right - pour it on . talk me out of it .
good evening , sir .	i come to the old lady 's funeral .
i do n't believe i 've seen you at any of our services before .	that 's because i 've been on the wagon .
please !	where are they holding the wake ? i 'm supposed to be one of the pallbearers .
what 'll it be , sir ?	booze .
sorry , sir , we only serve coffee .	coffee ?
scotch coffee , canadian coffee , sour-mash coffee ...	make is scotch . a demitasse . with a little soda on the side .
have n't you got another pew - not so close to the band ? how about that one ?	sorry , sir . that 's reserved for members of the immediate family .
better bring the check now - in case the joint gets raided .	who 's going to raid a funeral ?
okay , spats - the services are over . lets go .	go where ?
a little country club we run for retired bootleggers . i 'm gon na put your name up for membership .	i never join nothin ' .
you 'll like it there . i 'll have the prison tailor fit you with a pair of special spats - striped !	big joke . who 's the rap this time ?
embalming people with coffee - eighty-six proof .	me ? i 'm just a customer here .
come on , spats - we know you own this joint . mozarella is just fronting for you .	mozarella ? never heard of him .
we got different information .	from who ? toothpick charlie , maybe ?
you 're wasting the taxpayers ' money .	if you want to , you can call your lawyer .

i should get going .	are you sure youre okay ?
we were eating and puking together in harmony until one day , tony walked me home from school . he was my first boyfriend . i was fourteen .	so tony pee-pants starts ignoring kat . he wanted to play with me .
hey .	hey .
you know what ? im not having this conversation right now .	sure , disappear . weve been walking away our whole lives .
wow . you look beautiful .	yeah . most important day of my life . whatever . listen , i chose you to be my maid of honor for a lot of reasons : i love you , youre my favorite , and only , half-sister , blah blah blah . but the main reason i picked you is because youve been so miserable for the past few years , i knew you wouldnt outshine me . but here it is , my big day . my big day . and something doesnt feel right . maybe it was that pep talk you gave me last night , i dont know , but your misery just isnt working for me anymore .
fred astaire and whats her face !	its not me . i swear . its her . shes magic .
sorry to interrupt . your dad sent me .	what for ?
you know all that if these walls could talk stuff ? do you believe it ? that a place has a memory ?	actually , i do .
it was such a long time ago .	still --
if ed ever found out ... .	or kat ... .
youd better get going . my parents will be round to cart you off to the country .	whatever you do , dont mention italy . or politics . or baby buggies . or edith piaf .
say something . please .	i knew you were still seeing someone else when we finally got together . i never in a million years would have dreamt it was jeffrey .
does kat know ?	jeffrey told her last night .
wheres nick sleeping ?	why , with you .
huh ?	im not as square as my daughter thinks .
moms refining her strategy for dday .	im sure general eisenhower never had to master the finer points of the seating chart and centerpieces . oh , and tomorrow afternoon you are carpooling to the country with the fletcher-wootens .
id be happy to . youre welcome .	oh , dont be that way .
i blame tony pee-pants !	oh , no . she tells this story at every major holiday .
she blames tony pee-pants pinterello for everything . the fall of the british empire , the cold war , the internet .	it was just after we moved here . my little girls got in a fight over tony pee-pants and they havent made up since .
im an american and in america , people sue . so to prevent a lawsuit , i baked a tart . and i dont bake .	so dad rang the bell and when tony pee-pants opened the door , i threw the tart at him and popped his stitches .
whats going on with you two ?	i was pretty hard on her last night . and now shes getting married .
theres a reason i always tell that tony pee-pants story , you know .	trust me . this is bigger than tony pee-pants .
before tony , you and your sister were best friends . i couldnt split you up . if your sister ate the spinach , you ate the spinach . if you threw up -- .	mom , please .
anyway , when that boy came over , it was the first time you ever did anything without her . and amy wasnt just jealous ... she was sad and lonely . she missed you .	she did ?
whos ever heard of dance lessons for a wedding , honestly ?	um , just about everyone .
just because some slags been paid for , doesnt mean youve got to ... you know .	its been my experience that the people who hire a prostitute , need a prostitute . you did the right thing .
i think i love you , mate . how do you know so much about so much ?	im a hooker .
i thought you said you were crap .	i had to say something to get you here .
ill just check into a hotel .	dont be ridiculous . its late and the place is empty . just take my car .
i look like a total wanker , dont i ?	yeah , kind of .
you heading to the train station ?	i figured you could pick up your car tomorrow .
whats his problem ?	what ?
theres something about him thats just a bit odd .	other than , hes shagging your exgirlfriend ?
remember when we went hiking in the lake district and amy was wearing that little bikini thing .	no .
it was before you started going out . we had lunch at that inn on the lake .	oh , yes . right . the rat and parrot .
and kat was fully clothed .	but , somehow , it was kats arse that was stung by nettles . and you rubbed it with a dandelion leaf .
thats when i realized i wanted to be a doctor .	oh , shut up . youre an optician .
i didnt deserve her back then .	and you do now ?
nothing .	doesnt look like nothing .
hey .	oh , hello .
ah , a philosopher .	shrink , actually .
crikey .	what ?
nothing , nothing .	no , tell me .
hey , man .	sorry , can you give us a moment ?
why , jeffrey . hello .	hello , katmandu .
seeing you again ... .	yeah ?
hey , kat .	hey , yourself . i see youve met my ex .
hey , you !	let me guess . amy presumed id forget the rings . i think im her least favorite person . you know , i am sorry .
so , tell me , hows unmarried life ?	i have regrets .
whoa , jeffrey . slow down . you and me , were the past . im not sure if you noticed , but im here with someone else .	kat , we must talk . this guy , theres something not quite right .
its called character . god , youre predictable .	is that why you brought him ? because of me .
kat , wait . i dont want you hating me . weve never had this talk . you know how crap i am at this .	um , news flash : i dont give a shit .
that was a long time ago .	it was . and it took your sister getting married to get you back here .
so , whats your point ?	i should have told you why i broke up with you . i was a coward . you deserve to know .
you were so good to me . i swear i never meant to hurt you . we were together what , five years ?	seven if you count the on-and-off years . which i do .
right . seven . christ , thats a long time , isnt it ?	not for a dog .
is this supposed to be an apology ?	its not supposed to be anything , kat . its just my rather feeble attempt to ... . oh , i dont know . you see , i thought i could deny my feelings --
youre not even listening .	when we were together i was too here , now im not here enough .
bollocks , im sorry . i had no idea this would be so difficult .	relax . take a breath and just say it . its no big deal . i promise .
brilliant .	well , it was a big deal . as late as ... yesterday . or this morning . but not anymore .
its the past . its nothing but ghosts . so just get it off your chest , then lets go back upstairs and eat some tiramisu .	i slept with your sister .
im sorry ?	i shagged amy . two years ago . thats why i ended it . and then , after you left , sod it , we kept at it like rabbits until we both realized it was absolutely mad . and , you know , morally wrong . then there was that one other time . and that was it .
hi . hey .	kat .
you think we look like were trying too hard .	exactly . i want us to look like we fit , but not like were trying too hard to look like we fit . its welcome cocktails , not prom . with this level of matchy-matchy , we should be drinking peach schnapps under a bleacher somewhere .
what color are my shoes ?	you have feet ?
dont patronize me . theyve clearly been at this a while .	youre funny .
mission accomplished .	really ? dont get too attached .
mmm .	mmm , nice dress ? or mmm -- gorgeous , i was insane to let you go !
you know , they say you can tell everything you need to know about a person from the way they act when theyre naked .	i dont do naked . my sister ? she does naked .
the knicks game ? we both wanted the last hot dog ?	oh , yeah . so we split it . you know , as in share . people do that .
well , he looks miserable . what were you talking about ?	love .
jeffrey knows love like he knows macram .	he was pretty drunk , but i think hes still crazy about you .
what did he say exactly ? i mean , you dont think he wants me back ?	i dont know .
what does your gut say ?	youre too good for him .
no , count it , anyway .	why ?
six thousand , right ?	on the nose . i tell you what , because youre so cute , ill take care of our incidentals .
how does it feel to get that much money just for being you ?	great , with the occasional stabs of shame . now , listen , this covers the weekend , but as we discussed , if you want to be intimate , we talk money before anything happens .
that wont be an issue , believe me . i find the idea of sex for money morally repugnant . no offense .	its okay . hell , ive never paid for it . but please dont feel like you have to explain yourself to me .
you quitting ?	im desperate to start but i dont have an addictive personality . except for approval . that , i cant get enough of .
who are they ?	graham russell and russell hitchcock .
what ?	its cute .
what is ?	you stand on your tiptoes .
have you ever done anything like this before ?	a weekend ?
not the way youre thinking . the women wanted me there for support . you can understand that .	i think thats disgusting .
not you . youre not disgusting . youre lovely . just the idea that theyd bring an escort . i mean , a stranger who , um , didnt ... who never ... . i mean , someones dead .	thats right . imagine facing it alone .
sorry . im a little nervous . i never thought something like this would happen to me .	this happened to you ?
how did you know that was me ?	i have a friend at the magazine .
your friend guaranteed my anonymity .	if it makes you feel any better , to get your number , i had to cough up two round-trip tickets to amsterdam and a case of mini-baileys .
would you grab my shampoo ?	shampoo , got it !
the real story is that my mother was a hippie . and a stripper . she was insanely inappropriate with me . she used to wash her lingerie in my bathwater . while i was still in the bath .	oh , no .
you shit !	i have a different story for every woman who asks . i look at her and figure out what she needs to hear to feel okay about being with me .
and you thought id respond to the hippie stripper with no boundaries ?	admit it . you were disturbed , but ultimately moved .
so ... what was i ... oh , yeah . do you honestly think that i want to be single and miserable ? that i want to be obsessed with some asshole who led me on for years then -- out of the blue -- shattered my heart .	first of all , its never out of the blue . and second of all --
yes .	what ? !
are you asking me if im gay for pay ?	i guess so .
theres a guy on 81st and madison . you get your results in 24 hours . do you make your lovers get tested before you sleep with them ?	my sixth-grade science project was entitled , love hurts : the heartbreak of human papillomavirus . trust me , im careful .
i love that youre asking questions , but do you really want to get into all of this ?	this is awkward for me . talking about it makes me feel better .
dont stop asking questions , okay ?	okay .
i swear . i dont have a signature move .	oh , come on . youre like the yoda of escorts .
subtle ?	i disappear . its not about me .
its hard to explain .	show me .
come on .	ive got this bad taste in my mouth . what is it ? i think its the words : morally repugnant .
are you sure ?	we kissed . made out a little . then you passed out .
is this for last night ?	of course not . how ... how could it be ? nothing happened .
dont they have a limit at those machines ?	not if you take an advance on your credit card .
so youre telling me . if something had happened last night ... it would have cost me fourteen hundred dollars ? thats a down payment on a ford focus !	not dollars . pounds .
and what if i didnt want you to ... to do that to me ?	no , no . the three hundred is for you doing it to me .
what ?	believe me , if anything had happened , that would have been one of the highlights . for you .
but nothing did .	yup . thats why you get to keep your money .
hello , goodbye , i want you , i hate you . its all just words . none of it means anything . what matters is what you do . you either stay put or you walk away . if you look back , youre not walking away !	oh , cut the crap !
i just hate seeing you so stuck .	he was about to un-stick me ! i paid you to help me get closure .
im sorry i was such a bitch . i really appreciate your doing this .	its my job .
you have had girlfriends ?	sure , but its never easy . they say theyre okay with it , and they are ... for a while . then one day , theyre not .
when i said id never done a wedding before , i didnt say that no one ever asked . i just never said yes .	so , whyd you say yes to me ?
there was something in your voice on the phone that day .	desperation ?
what would you do if you were n't an escort ?	make out with you for free .
what would you do if you stopped worrying about what other people think ?	spontaneously combust ?
yeah . you ?	yeah .
fourteen and hes hoodwinked by a an erector set ?	i didnt say he was worth it .
and thats when he peed in his pants ? after the tart ?	he bled a bunch , but no , there was no peeing .
besides , you hired me for my discretion .	youve always got that to hide behind , dont you ? its just business !
you let me make a fool of myself ! you lied to me ! i dont know why that surprises me because lying is what you do . its your job . its who you are . how would you even know if something were real ?	youre judging me ? ! oh , thats a good one . youre lying to me , youre lying to your family , and youre lying to yourself . but youre going to stand there and point a finger at me ? the man you hired to pretend to be your boyfriend ?
youre right . i was so desperate to make everyone believe i was happy that i spent six grand on a lie . and after all that ? the only one who ended up falling for it was me .	go ahead , kat . hate me . you were running out of steam on the whole jeffrey thing . maybe now youll be able to hold onto this just long enough to ruin your next relationship .
hi .	hi .
i should go .	what ? ! no , no . you cant --
nice speech . i thought it was touching ... and funny .	thank you .
kat ellis ! we live two hundred miles away from each other but i have to fly all the way to london to see you . you havent visited me once in d.c. where the hell have you been ? i have gynecologists that call more often .	you have more than one gynecologist ?
you didnt have to do that .	i wasnt saving you from him . i was saving you from yourself .
whats he do anyway ?	therapist .
like fifteen .	dad made me go over and apologize the next day .
oh , no . he told you .	you knew ?
hey , sal .	i heard you were back in town , kitty cat . youre here for the highland flings , i bet .
the one i made for you is the cherries . you hang onto it or give it back ?	give it back ? are you nuts ?
you pawned it .	not exactly . i wear it . on my right hand . and only rarely .
you want i nut him in the boat ?	yes ? no . what ? save the patter for the tourists .
you want me to let him in ?	of course , dont be silly .
dad !	hi , kiddo .
thats not true . we checked for leaks a few years back . good morning .	ahoy !
so whyd you let him go ?	its complicated , dad .
yeah .	then for once in your life , do something for yourself .
im worried . amys not good at drinking . she gets sooo drunk sooo fast . does free alcohol get you less drunk or more drunker ? is it drunker or drunker-er ?	just drunk enough .
not yet ...	... but its getting there .
i thought you were living in san francisco . or was it nepal ?	close . sydney . turns out , i missed the rain .
i always wondered what happened with us .	i havent thought about that in years .
shes drunk . -er than me . but i didnt really dump you , did i ?	hard .
im guessing maccallum , 18 years . neat , with a water-back .	is there any other way to take it ?
i am now , sir .	at least somebodys using the damn thing . i was gon na fix her up but we took one trip and the kids fought so much , we never launched her again .
what is it you do again ?	what would you say if i told you i was a member of an elite task force employed to safeguard our nations most precious resource : your daughter .
what do you say to that ?	i say that feeling compelled to do the opposite of your parents is as enslaving as emulating them .
best thing about being a dad is when your kid starts kicking your ass --	-- and the ass of the man who adores her .
hey , sigmund , you think you could rustle up the bride and tell her to join the party ?	will do .
i just wanta wash my hand . it 's got blood where i hurt it .	you do n't live around here , do you ?
no , mam ... i come from way back there . me and my dog was tryin ' to find my daddy and we got lost .	is he here in borderdale ?
i do n't know , he 's in a prison camp .	here , you put your hand under the water and i 'll pump for you .
my name is camille -- camille johnson and i 'm the supervisor of this school . what 's your name ?	david lee morgan . my dog 's name is sounder . that feels better .
you keep looking around , david . do n't you go to school ?	sometime , but not like this .
it 's a good thing your hand did not become infected -- how did you cut it like this ?	me and sounder went to this prison camp to see my daddy and the police guard runs us away and i fell on some glass .
did your mother know you were going to see your father ?	uh huh ...
that does it ...	thank you , miss johnson .
you got a pretty house , miss johnson !	i try ...
and you say all them people is dead now ?	that 's right --
they lived a long time ago -- before you and i were born .	where is africa , miss johnson ?
here it is , right here .	that 's where we come from first ?
and the other people you told me 'bout , they is all colored folk ?	colored .
do n't you teach in your school 'bout folk who ai n't dead ?	sure --
here 's one by a man that 's very much alive .	what 's his name ?
dr. william e. b. dubois .	what he talk 'bout ?
you 're a friendly lady , miss johnson .	and you 're a tired little boy . i 'll make up the cot and you must get some sleep .
what about sounder ?	he 'll get his place too -- now off with your clothes and into bed .
now do n't you think it 's time you told me all about yourself ?	i have a mother and her name is rebecca -- my father 's name is nathan lee morgan , and ...
well , how did you like the class , david ?	it was the best thing i ever been to , miss johnson !
... so me and sounder , ran right by the men that was the prisoners , and crawled under the fence ! that 's when i cut my hand on the glass . it hurt like mad ! but i kept runnin ' , and then i did n't feel no more hurtin ' till i stopped runnin ' ! why was that , miss johnson ?	because all you could think of was getting away from the guard .
oh ... . you right , that 's all that was worryin ' me right then ...	you know , that was a good thing you did for clarence , in class today . i believed his story , but i was afraid the other children would n't ...
he was real scared nobody would believe him -- i could tell , even when he first stood up .	you could ? how ?
i been like that myself , when i thought nobody was gon na believe me ... you wan na hear another story ? !	not now , david , it 's time for bed . you have a long trip ahead of you in the morning ...
what are you looking at , out there ? there 's nothing to see .	my daddy likes to look into the dark , even when there ai n't nothin to see -- it 's what you hear he say .
you think about your father a lot , do n't you ?	yes mam ...
well , you should n't worry about him too much , david .	what do i tell my mama when i get home ? i did n't find him and that 's what i wanted to do .
but you did all you could , david . not many little boys could 've gone on such a journey as you did .	but where is my daddy ! ?
i ca n't answer that for you -- but it 's no fault of your own that you do n't know where your father is now . you tell me what you did that kept you from finding your father . come on , tell me ...	nothin ' ...
and so you did your job , right ?	yes , mam ...
whewwww ! you sure keep my mind jumping , boy !	what do that mean ?
you know that the class is going to challenge your story , do n't you , clarence ?	yes , miss johnson ...
go on ...	me and my little sister , went down to the water hole , last saturday --
how was your sister after you pulled her out of the water ?	she was dirty and wet ...
clarence , would you tell us a story that was not true , after telling us it was ?	no , miss johnson ...
can you swim ?	yes mam ...

but , charlie --	no ! n-o , no !
i see you found what you was lookin ' for .	i did look , charlie , but i --
no buts , rita !	charlie , you have no legal right not to let this boy know where his father is ! you hear that , you and this whole damn court house ; what you are doing is wrong !
do n't tell me about what 's wrong . you come into my office as a friend and steal city files ! i could have you arrested for that -- and if you give out that information to anybody , that 's exactly what i 'm going to do -- and i 'll tell everybody in this town how you got the information and who you got it for ! you wo n't have a friend left in this county to bring you a piece of candy !	you would do that , would n't you ?
there ai n't no possums in this woods tonight , daddy .	looks that way , son . guess the cold done drove most of 'em down to the big water country -- but if there 's one left out here -- we got ta find him .
it 's cold , daddy !	here , put my jacket over you .

when the fall comes in these parts , the night moon runs away like a rabbit -- you could stay out here lookin ' all night , and not see a thing out yonder .	we goin ' huntin ' again tomorrow ?
yep . i guess you must wonder why though , what with the luck we havin ' , but like i always say --	`` you lose some of the time , what you always go afta , but you lose all the time what you do n't go afta ! ''
well , looka here ...	hi , daddy ...

it 's a shame they wo n't let 'em come in here . if i had the strength i 'd knock down these damn walls -- if i could just git my arms 'round your mama right now -- is they on this side of us , son ?	i think so ...
can you say what camp they gon ' send you to , daddy ?	i do n't know , son -- they wo n't tell us things like that -- but i do n't want y'all to come here no more .

what 's wrong with your leg , daddy ?	got it hurt in a dynamite blast , son . the dirty dogs had no more use for me , so they let me have time off my sentence , and let me come home .
son , that was some trip you went on ...	where was you , daddy ?
that musta been afta they sent me to this place call clayburn . that was the hardest workin ' camp they sent me to . the work was so hard , you had to look for somethin ' to laugh about to keep from feelin ' the whole pain in your body . like one time , it was in the middle of the day , and there were n't no sun -- you hear that ?	where did the sun go to , daddy ?
into the clouds and behind the mountains .	what happened afta that ?

miss boatwright --	yes , david ...

what 's in there , david ! ?	sausage and hambones !
he eats all right -- his throat ai n't scarred .	then why do n't he holler like he usta ?
he will ... come on , git down and act like a possum .	i do n't look like no possum !
i guess i 'll havta work harder to git him back like he usta be .	why do n't you try and git you a new dog ?
naw , i 'm carryin ' it !	thank you , josie mae .
david lee , it 's time for you to get to bed !	goodnight .
mama , there 's hot meat on the stove !	that 's right !
where did it come from , mama ?	where all meat come from -- now git yourself washed up and be snappy about it -- you got six miles ahead of you to that school .
ready to go , mama !	tuck that shirt in , david lee .
you got two shirts on ?	yes mam ...
who 's winning , mama ?	nobody yet -- it 's all tied up .
what do they do in the white churches , mama ?	same as we -- they pray .
who is they ?	children , come here ...
do n't take my daddy ! please do n't take my daddy !	david , come back here !
'bye , mama ...	'bye , son -- i wo n't be gone long .
did you see daddy ?	no , son . we havta wait 'til the holiday comes -- anyway , they wo n't let womenfolk see their men no time .
can i go when the holiday comes ?	you sure can , son ...
any sign of sounder ?	no mam -- i looked all over .
what is it , david lee ?	listen , mama ...
poor creature ...	he 'll be all right , mama . i 'll make him all right .
mama ! mama ! miss boatwright , say she gon ' help me find where daddy is !	good ! but you do n't have to tell the whole valley 'bout it ! you 'll get that woman in trouble !
ca n't sleep ?	no , ma'am ... mama , i wanted mrs. boatwright to find out where daddy is , so me and sounder can go see him .
so did i. i figured when the time got right , we could all take a day or two and walk up there , but it 's not the kind of long trip for a child to take alone .	i can do it , mama -- you know that . in the bible stories you read to us , everybody 's always goin ' on a long journey . jacob goes into a strange land where his uncle is and he do n't even know where he lives , but he finds him . everybody finds what they supposed to find .
but you 'll be away from home for days -- what will you do when the dark comes , where will you sleep ? i ca n't send you away from here like that !	mama , do n't i always do what you say -- every time i go to the fields to plant the corn , to miss boatwright 's and the woods -- you tell me what to do and i do it , and you do n't worry .
can i go day after tomorrow ?	yes , son . you better get back to bed .
good night , mama ...	good night ...
i wish you would n't take the dog with you , david -- he 's likely to be a burden to you .	i got to , mama . i know daddy wants to see him .
here 's your food -- now you go straight to that place -- if you need to rest , go into a church or railroad station -- but do n't go into nobody 's house , you hear me ?	yes , mam ...
i cut it on some glass and we got lost , mama .	did you find your father ?
did n't see 'im , mama . the other men there say they did n't know daddy .	i guess they musta sent 'im to another camp .
what 's that you carryin ' ?	some books miss johnson gave me .
who 's miss johnson ?	miss johnson is a teacher , and ...
so when i left , she gave me these books .	miss johnson must be a real kindly lady .
she is , mama ... when the fall comes , she wants me to come to her school .	how can you do that ? you do n't live anywhere near that school .
she says i can come live with her while school goin ' on , and come back home every time there ai n't no school .	but who 's gon na help me here with the house and in the field ?
what 's wrong with him , david ?	it 's the heat .
it 's when the heat is so bad , dogs go crazy .	he wo n't go mad -- he 's just lookin ' for a cooler spot .
what 's wrong , nathan ?	he ca n't get up , mama !
be good and be smart , little boy .	yes , ma 'm ...
we brought your laundry , miss boatwright .	come in , children .
this is for your mama 's work , and here 's something for the three of you .	thank you , miss boatwright .
it 's about the three musketeers .	thank you , miss boatwright .
when you read it we 'll talk about it ...	yes mam ... we got ta go , miss boatwright.. .
would you like to have a cool drink , david ?	no , thank you -- i got ta go do some work in the field today .
i 'll find out where your daddy is for you .	thank you , miss boatwright !
you know where my father is , do n't you , miss boatwright ?	no , he was wrong , david , i did n't find out .
but i saw you -- you looked in there , and you found out , miss boatwright .	if i tell you i did n't , david , that 's what i mean .
but , miss boatwright , you --	i do n't know a damn thing , now stop bothering me about it !
come , i 'll take you home .	i 'll walk ...
do n't pout now , david , it 's a long trip .	i 'm used to it .
hello , david ...	hi , mrs. boatwright ... i 'm sorry 'bout the way i acted the other day , miss boatwright .
if they heard me sing like this up north i 'd be richer than the man i sharecrop for .	and if they saw me pitch the way i did today -- they 'd hire me just to strike out babe ruth !
you know , one time by mistake i went into a white church down in row county and to this day i do n't know how'n the devil i got outta that church alive .	they probly thought you was crazy .
i guess so -- but i went home and did me some praying to the lord . i said , lord , i went into this white church down in row and all i want you to tell me is how i ever got outta there in one piece .	what did the lord tell you , ike ?

hi ya , rebecca ...	tired .
somebody told me nathan was back . how is he ?	why do n't you pay him a visit , mr. howard ? he 'll tell you all about it .

dude , do you know what you 're doing ?	no , dude , all you have to do is hit the keys really fast and say a bunch of stupid shit and it works .
wow , a lot of people showed up .	yeah , so what do we say ?
i thought you had something planned .	me ? !
oh , brother .	did you shut the alarm off , cartman ?
stan !	dude , i found the clitoris ! i think i can get wendy to like me now !
what ?	are you sure , kenny ?
thank you , kenny .	yeah , thanks for going back to hell for us . you 're a real pal .
whew , i 'm sure glad that 's over .	yeah , but you know , i learned something today . i learned that getting all worked up over fuck and shit and cockmaster is just stupid ... you all focused so hard on erasing profanity that you forgot the most important thing ... to love each other .
mom , i 'm a man . just a man . and i 'm going to have fun with profanity just like you and dad did when you were little .	yeah , so what if you say uncle raper or dicksucker or , or-
oh dear god ...	what is 'fisting ' ?
i knew this would happen ! those bastard canadians have now killed a child ! ca n't people see the damage that film is doing ? !	he was killed doing something he saw in the movie . it was terrance and phillip ... they killed kenny .
sheila , you 're going to far ! those are your children !	yes ! and i will not allow my children to be ruined by smut ! ! i am sorry young man , but i have had it up to here ! strap them in !
oh lord , what have we done ... ?	wake up , people ! we all have to do things that are n't pretty sometimes ! it 's the not pretty things that make life worth fighting the not pretty things for ! why do you think children have to be born in hospitals ?
where are you going ? ! we need to stop the not pretty things from letting our children be born in hospitals !	we 're going to find our boys ! for god 's sake sheila , you almost had them killed ! !
shiteater-	-or monkey fucker-
my fellow americans . i have led this fight in the war against profanity . i have founded mothers against canada . our neighbor to the north has abused us for the last time .	as commander in chief , i have ordered our army to set up defensive positions along the us-canada border in anticipation of an attack .
what about air strikes ?	huh ?
we have to have air strikes on their military and entertainment centers . it 's the only way to ensure that their smut ca n't reach american soil !	oh , uh ... i do n't know if air strikes are necessary .
ma'am , we 're tracking a resistance ... it 's probably canadian spies ! !	well find out where that signal is coming from ! then hunt them down like dogs ! any and all canadian influence must be stopped at all cost !
and bill ?	yes ?
i 'm needing lunch .	right away , ma'am !
you 're all part of satan 's army now !	what the hell is going on ? !
i am the dark master !	oh no you do n't ! this is my fight ! ! i do n't need your help , alan dershwitz !
silence ! i am satan !	oh .
yes ... and in doing so , you brought enough anger and intolerance to the world to allow my coming .	and i thought my mother was the master of guilt . geez louise .
silence ! ! ! now ! ! ! everyone bow down to me ! ! !	oh god ... what have i done ...
what did my son say , principal victoria ? did he say the s word ?	no , it was worse than that ...
the f word ? !	no , worse . here 's a short list of the things they 've been saying .
terrance and phillip movie ? ! oy gevalt ! not again !	what is terrance and phillip ?
terrance and phillip are two very untalented , unfunny actors from canada . their tv show is filled with toilet humor and bad language and is just complete garbage . now it appears they have a movie and i 'm positive it 's not suitable for children !	well , it looks like i 'll have to send a warning letter out to parents . i have to put a stop to this before more children see 'terrance and phillip ' .
we must take action on this immediately .	ooh yes . i think we 'll have to give detention to those boys .
article 42 ! you do n't mean- ? !	yes principal victoria . the pta is impeaching you .
but i-	you are officially relieved of your duties as principal of this school !
uh , we 're just , starting our program ...	this is not a place for fun and games ! this is rehabilitation ! now get to it ! ! we at mac have a trial to go to !
how is the children 's progress ?	very encouraging . most of the children have been weened from their naughty mouths .
what do you mean most , why not all ?	well , some of the children just do n't respond to 12 step programs .
mrs. brovlofski , the v-chip has n't been fully tested yet , it could be dangerous .	i do n't care if it 's dangerous ! desperate times call for desperate measures , mr. mackey . perhaps i need to remind you of your situation .
what ? ! why would you call me a pigfucker ? !	well , let 's see ... first of all , you fuck pigs .
well , fuck my ass and call me a bitch , i just got a letter !	a letter from who , you shit sucking cock master ?
it 's from your mother .	my mother sent you a letter ? what 's it say ?
you 'd fuck your uncle !	you 'd fuck your uncle !
< b > shut your fucking face , unclefucka ! ! you 're an asslicking , ball sucking unclefucka ! ! you 're an unclefucka , yes it 's true nobody fucks uncles quite like you- < /b >	< b > shut your fucking face ! ! unclefucka ! ! ! you 're the one that fucked your uncle , unclefucka ! ! ! you do n't eat , or sleep or mow the lawn you just fuck your uncle all day long ! < /b >
well , terrance i hope you learned something from this whole experience .	i did , terrance , i learned that you are a boner biting dick fart fuck face !
say phillip , want to see the northern lights ?	you bet , terrance !
ha ha ha ! you burned yourself to death by lighting the fart ! ha ha ha ! !	i sure did , phillip ! !
hello , conan !	hello , brooke shields !
good one , phillip ! cheers .	cheers , terrance !
phillip , we 've been tricked and ambushed by the conan o'brian show ! !	this little scrotum sucker willfully deceived us ! you are a bad man !
fight the power !	the young boy that died lit himself on fire . it was unfortunate , but how can they blame us ?
the problem is you do n't allow your children to think for themselves . you try to raise them in a protective bubble , and then when they finally get old enough , they realize they 've been lied to , and they resent you for it .	yeah , god , no wonder your country is so fucked up .
oh , you are such a maroon !	you would know , dummy .
oh , phillip . this can not be good .	i know , terrance . this is quite the shitstorm we 've found ourselves in this time .
phillip , this is worse than that trip to quebec city when i fell asleep in that disco .	i know , terrance . i know .
what 's going on terrance ?	canada is saving us ! !
did you hear that , terrance ? i farted !	you did ? just now ?
agh !	terrance ! no !
you 're quite a purveyor of filth , little boy !	indeedy , that was a delicious choice of words !
oh , a new recruit , huh ? welcome to hell , kid ! relax ! take a load off ! !	you remember ... saddam hussein , do n't you ? !
saddam , would you let me do my job please !	hey relax , guy . let 's see what the kid wants .
well of course he wants out of hell ! the whole point of hell is that you do n't want to be here !	okay , kid , i have a deal for you ! if you want out of hell , all you have to do is collect 10 proofs of purchases from 'snacky smores . ' they 're rich , chocolatey and really hit the spot . bring me ten proofs of purchases and we 'll grant you any wish you want .
i do n't see why you have to belittle me in front of people like that .	hey , relax guy . it 's just a cruel joke . rich , chocolatey snacky smores are only available up on earth . he 'll never get 'em , see ?
sometimes i just think you do n't have any respect for me .	hey , come here , guy .

< b > thank my lucky stars here before me now is everything i 'd ever hoped for- < /b >	< b > knew it in a word saw it in a glance the only thing i think i 'd die for < /b >

getting drunk is no solution .	yeah , well ... i forgot my morphine back in the room .
i think we 're moving .	well is n't that great . something to write home about .
i never though i 'd be stuck in a wine closet with warren wayne .	well get used to it , 'cause here we are , on the cruise of a lifetime .
oh warren ... oh warren ... take me , god take me ...	oh yeah ...
oh yeah ...	oh sara ...
anna ...	anna ...
jesus , come on !	they 're not going to make it !
evening .	it ca n't be .
excuse me ?	you 're warren wayne .
uh , yes i am . and you are ?	anna koros . she sensually extends her hand , warren shakes it -
koros , as in ... koros ? dimitri koros ?	my grandfather . my god , i ca n't tell you what a fan i am of yours ! you were magnificent in deadly gamble .
oh , thank you .	magnificent , magnificent .
well i appreciate that .	so , what brings you out here ? pleasure cruise ?
well a little business too . in my upcoming project star trackers i play a ship 's captain , and i really wanted to get a feel for the outer space experience . i feel it will add more credibility to my performance .	of course , of course ...
so ...	well i guess we 're neighbors for this trip .
well , so we are . sure is beautiful , huh ?	it certainly is .
well , it was nice meeting you . enjoy the rest of the trip .	i 'm sure i will .
no , i think hygiene is important . it helps you get into the part .	very professional of you .
where the hell did you come from ?	hello second mate barnes . i was instructed to come to the bridge .
were n't you down in the dining room ?	i was there . officer taylor accessed my cpu directly to open the airlock doors . they are not functioning properly .
yes he did . yes he did . barnes looks at the monitor - taylor and the others are still in the dining room -	you did n't do anything to the monitors , did you mac ?
and what are they doing now , mac ?	they are awaiting further information .
were you going to give it to them ?	i am here to provide service to ... to all our guests . there is a high level of passenger dissatisfaction . it is my duty ... to report this .
on channel 10 ?	the device has stopped responding .
mac , you really earned your wings this flight .	my ... wings ...
i am here to provide service to ... to all our guests . there is a high level of passenger dissatisfaction . it is my duty ... to report this .	i hear you mac and i appreciate it . frankly i do n't know what i 'd have done without you on this one .
there is a high level ... of passenger dissatisfaction .	and i intend to correct that at once . i 'll tell you something mac ...
why should she , it 's her fault . all guests are told not to eat in zero gravity , but she just wanted to have fun i guess , did n't realize what a grain of salt can do to sophisticated machinery .	well , i guess she figures she 's paying for it .
what did you say to me ?	it 's a little late for you to be up .
all too well , captain .	well shut it off at once !
well i guess there 's no time like the present . i 'll go run a check on that room , just to show we go that extra mile for our guests .	sounds like you 've been talking to mac too much .
no , i just ran it ! why are you running it again ?	well it 's a good thing that i did .
it 's telling me fail mode confirmed . did you see this ?	there must be some mistake . you sure you hit the right commands ?
yes i 'm sure i hit the right commands .	why do n't you reset and run it again . the pods check out ok .
you 're certain of that ?	trust me . even checked 'em with my own eyes .
well , everything 's running smoother than a baby 's ass .	ai n't it the truth . the two say nothing for a beat -
so , are you on for the next one ?	i do n't know . everything 's up in the air at this point , no pun intended .
why , did n't they say ?	well that hotel begins construction in january , there 's going to be a lot of shuttle work .
you want to go back to shuttle work ?	it 's steady , good benefits .
you got ta think of your old age .	that 's very pragmatic of you , barnes .
man , i 'm hungry . i 'm going to call the steward , you want anything ? .	nah , i already ate . why do n't you just go down there ?
what , and leave you here all by your lonesome ?	uh ...
i think i can handle it .	well , maybe i will . you sure you do n't want anything ?
no . i 'm all set . thanks .	well , maybe i 'll surprise you .
bridge ! can anyone hear me ? !	yeah yeah yeah , give me a minute here .
if anyone can hear me please respond !	that 's very professional sounding of you , taylor .
barnes , can you hear me , are you all right ?	why yes ryan , i am , and thanks for asking . you do n't have to talk to the intercom , i can hear you fine .
the bridge is fine , taylor , how are things down there ?	transmit the code 3 emergency and take us offline . override the airlock sensors and hurry ! we 're running out of time , we have to get to the pods !
much as i 'd like to help you and our valued guests , i 'm afraid i ca n't .	what are you talking about ! can you transmit the code 3 -
now do you want the good news first or the bad news ?	you better start making sense !
ok , i will . the bad news is the ship is history . life support will last another 36 hours , maybe .	then we 've got to get to the lifepods !
it 's still not going to work ! they 'll detect you upon re-entry in an emergency vessel !	who said i 'll re-enter in the pod ? i got friends out in space , ryan , friends willing to get me back unnoticed . thank god for deregulation huh ?
uh , that 's an affirmative , roger wilco . please proceed .	we have the codes here . how do you want to receive them ?
that was a joke taylor , lighten up ! why do n't you just hold them up to the lens . i 'll write them down , and once i 'm through verifying them , i 'll get back to you .	will you transmit the distress signal ?
mac , can you hear me ? come in ?	taylor , you surprise me .
i do n't know what you 're talking about !	sure you do . sending mac out on a little recon work . how pathetic . problem is it seems mac blew a few fuses . or maybe he 's just a little drunk . were you partying with a robot taylor ?
look we gave you what you asked for . it checks out did n't it ? ! what more do you want from us !	i told you not to try anything smart ! i guess you 're too much of a maverick to follow a simple order ! and that 's just too bad for all of you now , is n't it ?
idiot ...	good help is hard to find ...
barnes ?	that 's me .
break it down to me , what 's going on ?	seems like they 're cooperating . hopefully i 'll be out of here and on my way very soon .
well do n't drag your ass . there wo n't be much of a window for us to link up . we 'll be in your orbit trajectory in less than two hours .	yeah , i know bill , i came up with the plan remember ? just have those hangar doors open and ready , i can take it from there .
will do . what about the distress signal ?	i do n't know . i really have n't made up my mind yet . we 'll see how nicely they behave .
well that 's your call . does n't make a damn bit of difference to me . just as long as i get my cut .	oh you 'll get it , believe me . so i 'll see you in a few .
it 's time we lock coordinates .	i know , i know .
so , what are we waiting for ?	cool your jets ... i 'm doing a little damage control .
you 're not helping my heart condition any , barnes ! now just what the hell are you dragging your ass for ?	the others decided to get cute with me , so i 'm teaching them a lesson !
this ship is going down in a blaze of glory !	well blaze your ass out of there ! you 've completely altered your trajectory , are we linking up or not ? !
well if you knew it then why did set your thrusters on before making the calculation ?	i told you , i had to teach a few people a lesson !
goddamn it barnes this really steams my onions !	let 's get something straight , chappy !
now i got enough air and supplies to make another complete orbit in the pod ! you 're just gon na have to pick me up later .	this is a major screw up on your part , goddamn it !
is that clear ?	that 's clear .
good . now you 'll hear from me when i have the new coordinates . in the meantime do n't bug me .	sheesh ! aye aye cap'n !
look at this ... jesus .	yeah , i guess money do n't buy class .
no . but it buys a lot of other things .	like that piece of ass he was with .
well ... i do n't mind . i can put up with it . i 'm taking six months off after this , and i wo n't have to deal with people snapping their fingers at me .	not me . i 'm in for the long haul . in nine months i 'll have enough to take a few years off .
well , more power to you . me , i start to bug out after too much time out here .	i do n't have a problem with it . besides , you get to meet a lot of interesting people .
what 's the use ... we 're gon na die ...	do n't say that ! it ai n't over till it 's over !
we 're going to die .	will you shut up already ?
it 's getting hard to breathe ...	just do n't move around too much .
oh right , right you 're on that research grant .	that 's right .
ryan taylor , first mate . welcome aboard . first time in space ?	yes . theoretical discoveries aside , there 's nothing like the real thing . how about you ?
so you were looking for a new challenge .	well , plus the money ai n't that bad . dawn so , tell me , do you think everyone gets their million dollars ' worth on this trip of a lifetime ?
well , let me put it this way . most of the cost is due to safety reasons . most people are not familiar with space travel , so we have to take extra precautions in the event they do something careless .	like open an airlock by mistake ?
well i do n't think there 's a chance of that happening . it 's usually the moon walks . sometimes you feel like a kindergarten teacher .	well i hope i do n't do anything careless .
i 'm sure you 'll be all right .	actually i 've logged about 200 hours of simulated space walking at the institute , mostly related to starship construction .
really ?	still , i hope i behave on the moon . i 'll stick close to you .
what are we going to do ?	i do n't know .
we do n't .	well maybe there 's a way out of here .
given a malfunction , how would a rescue team get you out if the doors wo n't open ?	probably come through the wall i suppose .
i do n't think you know what you 're talking about . besides , what could we use for tools ? a steak knife ? a corkscrew ?	just considering our options ... sir .
supposing we could get out of this room ? is there anything we could do to reach the bridge ?	it depends on the condition of the ship . if i could get to one of the suit compartments i could check the exterior air locks for a possible entry .
ca n't we access the mainframe to check the ship 's condition ?	with what ? how am i going to interface with it ? i need to be able to talk to the system and to have the system talk to me .
ok ... it 's open .	seen one like it before ?
sure . it complies with all standard construction codes .	great .
damn it . if only we could get to those suits ... dawn then thinks of something -	why ca n't we ?
and suppose you could n't hold out ?	suppose you did n't have to hold your breath ?
we could send mac . if he can retrieve one suit , we could go back for the other .	you 're right .
he certainly is polite .	close every door behind you !
it must be oxygenated if we can hear him .	yeah , let 's hope he can find a way through .
if i could get to the bridge i could send the distress signal .	even if we do , it might be too late .
everyone just stay put .	wait .
i ca n't let you do that .	look i know what i 'm doing . i have experience and training in space walking .
i do n't know what we 're facing .	i understand .
are you ready ?	ready as i 'll ever be .
yeah . we did it .	so we did .
you 're ready for the real thing ?	at this point i 'm ready for anything .
be careful , you do n't want to puncture the suit .	do n't worry about me . where are we going ?
explosive ?	one of barnes ' duds , luckily for us . take this out of the equation right now ...
taylor ?	yeah ?
well , dawn , i 'm an optimist by nature .	yeah , but you did n't answer my question .
do you want some advice ?	sure .
do n't worry about what will happen , just concentrate on what is happening . you 'll live longer .	words to live by .
dawn ! dawn !	helllp !
i guess i owe you a debt of gratitude . you saved my life .	it was no time to lose my partner . we 're going to have to hurry , he 's on to us .
oh my god . what happened ?	the room is filled with poison gas . the hydraulic system must have blown .
what 's that ?	a schematic of the ship . looking for a lifeline to the pods .
we do n't have enough suits to get the others out .	that 's why we need a safe passage . remember what you said earlier , about getting through the wall ? that might just be our ticket .
take this flare .	a flare ? a flare wo n't do it .
a little dab 'll do ya . now you know how to get there , right ?	why ? where are you going ?
i 'm not going with you .	what ? what are you talking about ?
and what are you going to do ? !	i 'm going to try and buy you some time . i can get to the bridge from here .
but how are you going to escape ?	do n't worry about me . there 's still a chance i can issue a distress signal .
but you ca n't be sure ! it 's suicide . you have to come with us !	i ca n't !
i will once i get past the bulkhead . good luck .	you too .
dawn . come in .	taylor ! where are you ?
i 'm in the bridge .	barnes ?
he 's out of the equation . talk to me .	i 'm about to blow the wall .
hurry . you have to get them out of there !	how does the distress signal look ?
uh , it 's ok , everything 's going to be ok ... now i 'm counting on you , and whatever you do keep calm , we do n't want them to panic .	i 'll do my best .
so what 's going to happen to you ?	i 'm staying with the ship . i 'll be all right . now hurry .
thanks for everything , taylor . will i see you again ?	hopefully sooner than later .
sooner than later .	over and out .
what the hell are you doing ?	we have room ! let 's go !
what do you mean ? what happened !	we do n't have time . i 'll explain later , hurry !
so close ...	and so far .
i never thought this would happen . no premonitions , nothing .	it did . it is . there 's nothing we can do about that .
will you marry me ?	marry you ?
i would , but no one can perform the ceremony . i guess it does n't matter .	it would matter to us .
in that case , i accept .	good . in that case , i pronounce us man and wife .
right now it 's about 8 o'clock at home . people are going to work , kids are going to school ...	try not to think about it .
what is it ? !	i do n't know . wave to them !
i 'm fine .	congratulations on your ... recent award .
thank you .	is there anything i can help you with ?
no , just enjoying the view .	well , there 's no better to way to see the world , than with us .
so i 've been told .	well if you need anything , please feel free to ask me . just a reminder we have fabulous cuisine available 24 hours in the earthrise room , and a large selection of vintage wines here in our ship bar .
yes mac , but the guests are requesting it . it will reduce the level of negative feedback .	that is one of my priorities .
what is happening around here ! ! !	there 's no time to explain . get everyone together ! we found a way to the pods !
where 's taylor ?	he 's up on the bridge ! he 's going to be ok. now who 's missing ?
carlo !	he 's in the bathroom .
i 'm going back for taylor !	are you nuts ! it 's too risky !
i 'm homesick .	homesick ? it 's only been two days !
we should have gone to nassau . at least we could go swimming , lie on the beach .	ah hell we can always do that . listen believe me , once we get to the moon , your tone is going to change .
how is it going to be different from this ? go see some boring footprint under glass ?	look you were the one who wanted to do something different , something to tell all your friends . any chump can go to nassau .
look around you baby , we 're rubbing elbows with royalty , oil sheiks , this is class . you 'll be envied by everyone .	i guess so .
oh no ... i think there 's carrots in here ...	send it back if you do n't want it .
well now what are we gon na do !	how am i supposed to know ?
you 're delbert miles ! you have more clout than some whacked out pilot ! talk to him !	talk to him ... jesus ...
it 's getting too cold in here . i ca n't stand this anymore !	baby , take it easy .
look . we 're talking about life and death here . i do n't know why we 're even having this conversation .	well what would you know about it ? you do n't have anything to lose .
you 're gon na give him those bank codes , you know why ? because i 'm telling you to , that 's why . i 'm not losing my life over some greedy pig .	who are you calling a pig , rummy ?
i have n't quite made up my mind yet .	i 'll tell you what you 're gon na do . you 're gon na stay put like taylor said .
again with the orders from you ! you got a napoleon complex chief , and i 'm getting sick of it !	what are you going to do about it ?
i tell you , something 's not right here . how do we know they 're not going to use the pod for themselves ?	because , taylor would n't do that , that 's why .
what the hell is that ?	the engines !
officer taylor , how are you this evening ?	mac . what 's shaking ?
mac , i have a favor to ask you . mac looks at taylor -	certainly . if you need anything , please feel free to ask me . just a reminder we have fabulous cuisine available --
yes i know all that . mac , i need you to help us out with a little technical problem .	certainly . i have a full working knowledge of the ships operations .
i need you to actually do something for me . i need to access your cpu , directly .	that will not be necessary . you can simply speak to me . i understand most languages fluently .
yeah but the ship 's mainframe does n't . i need you to tell it something .	alteration of my central processing unit should be done only by an authorized service dealer .
now mac , can you tell me the status of this deck ?	one moment please ... one moment please ...
but the corridor outside this door is open , correct ?	yes . you can enjoy some wonderful views from there .
mac , what about the suit compartments on this level ? can they be accessed ?	i 'm sorry . the suit compartments are in a non-oxygenated , zero gravity atmosphere . i 'm afraid that 's off limits to all passengers .
ok mac ... i 'll talk to you on this . i want to find a way to get to the bridge , then i want you to come back .	certainly . anything i can do to be of service .
how is it looking , mac ?	i would recommend a maintenance crew in this sector .
is it safe for human transport ?	that 's affirmative .
i 'm an addict . i ca n't go through a day without the stuff . theo reaches over and pours for him with a steady hand .	you 're not from around here , are you ?
i 'm looking for a man .	what kind of man ?
99 years , 241 days , 15 hours , and 20 minutes of no bowling . alfie shuffles up to the self-serve island and begins wiping it down .	find your bowler ?
yeah , but it did n't go so good . he was n't the man i thought he 'd be . theo is trying to affix the lid on his cup , but his hands are trembling , spilling some of the coffee .	my father used to say to me `` never ... '' no , hmmm . `` always ... '' no , no ... ah ! love and hate are blood relations .
did you hear about that bowler who got smeared ? i saw them pull a body bag out of the alley . i heard he was kacked but good . they had to take apart the pin machine to get him out .	the pin machine ?
you a mini-golfer ?	nope .
paradise , huh ? might be one of the new putt-putts off route 99. theo turns to leave .	can i get you something for the road ?
you have orange whips ?	orange who ? not from 'round here , are ya ?
where can i find buzz fazeli ?	whoa , cool your maples . over the bridge , past the peter pan , last house on the dead end . theo releases sid 's hand . sid drops to his knees and cradles his damaged hand .
have n't seen a ball like that since '69 .	it belonged to my dad .
i do n't know no buzz fazeli .	look sid , a buzz burger . the faz 's favorite lunch . sid reaches for the plate . buzz walks over to the booth and pulls his burger away from sid .
hey , cut it out sid , that tickles . i 'm serious ! you guys are related , right ?	he 's my dad .
heh , heh , heh .	you said it would be unethical to help me . you call dwarf bowling ethical !
sorry about your loss .	i should 've pegged you guys for bowling dicks from day one .
after we id , we bury the body . case and casket closed .	you tried to make it look like junior trashed his place . junior 's underground in that coffin you dicks put him in .
hey , ai n't i seen you on the tour ?	no , pinhead , he ai n't here to bowl .
fazeli ... i do n't know no buzz fazeli .	what do you want with old man faz ?
yeah , basement bingo .	lem me see your ball .
ah , come on , lem me see your ball .	you afraid we 're gon na steal it ?
three whips . to go .	when you get a chance .
hey , you still here ?	we 're looking for buzz fazeli , seen him ?
buzz , mr. kastle wants to talk to you .	are you guys bruddas ?
look , faz , mr. kastle was not his usual charismatic self today when he told us to tell you ... what was that he said ... ?	i remember , sid ! mr. kastle says he do n't like no sticky fingers in the till .
your pop said to put these on his tab . sid gets up and jerks his thumb towards the door .	so buzz , let 's skedaddle . mr. kastle is waiting . as buzz gets up , theo rises and steps between his father and the two sleazeballs .
bowling used to be so pure , so ... all- american . breeze sings along with caruso and pretends to conduct .	la da da dalala ...
i hate fuckin ' opera .	how could you hate opera , sid ? opera has all the drama and excitement of real life - to music !
how do you know , you do n't even speak latin ?	you listen to the feelings , not the words .
you got an 8-track tape player on purpose , just 'cause you knew the only thing they had on 8-track was fuckin ' opera .	it was a clearance .
you know , elvis bowled .	no kiddin ' .
bowling was the most incorruptible sport . no megalomillionaires , no	gambling . and it was a safe place for kids , a place where the whole community could meet for some wholesome , clean fun .
sure , sid .	but not no more . now people take advantage . bowling ai n't what it used to be . there 's something evil spreading in this sport - like a big , gigantic , puss- ridden -
- canker sore .	right , eating at the core , eating it 's way out . it makes me sick !
how do you turn this thing off ?	wait ! that 's an aria !
hello mr. kastle . junior , long time . i thought they locked you up and threw away the warden !	is it true they blacked out the whole county giving you electro-shock ? junior looks from one man to the other , breathing heavily , his nostrils flaring .
bowling police , step back , give him room .	nothing going on here , everybody stand back . let him through , ladies . ladies , please . as they start to move through the female throng , a little girl pops out in front of them , holding her ball .
did you know you were parked in the handicap space ?	kastle 's daughter 's been lookin ' for you .
she told us you went after junior to save your old man 's hide . you got some balls goin ' after that psycho .	only problem is , you did n't put his lights out , you just got him mad . then he took it out on poor faz , god rest his soul . theo patches out .
think he bought it ?	i 'd buy it !
the faz sure took care a her . breeze makes a nasal grunt as he tries to suppress a snigger . sid - trying to keep a straight face - elbows him . sid and breeze approach the coffin . breeze pulls an orange whip out of a paper bag and carefully places it on the coffin lid .	nectar of the bowling gods , faz .
yeah , and make it extra muddy , i did n't sleep a zee last night . sheila fills a cup . buzz lifts it to his mouth , his hands trembling .	you do n't need coffee , mr. fazeli ; you need a vacation . sheila catches sight of theo pulling into the parking lot . she puts a ken head earring in her right ear . buzz follows sheila 's gaze .
buzz burger , side of 'cues . you have n't introduced me to your fan .	sheila , meet ... uh ... i forget the name .
you look like you 're something on the lanes .	theo 's bowled on the tour .
what 's on your mind , miles ?	we 've been partners a long time now , have n't we buzz ?
this scam we got going here was your	brainstorm , buzz . i admit , i thought it was a rotten idea , but i put up the scratch . and now we got a beautiful thing .
it 's a beautiful thing .	a beautiful thing . and you know why buzz ? you know what we got ? buzz raises an eyebrow as he buttons his shirt .
and look at that ; both partners go down together . kastle shoves the sculpture onto the floor , stands up , and crushes it under his heel . he goes over and puts his arm around buzz .	simple math , buzz . two plus two does not equal three .
miles , i 've always been on the square with you .	i 'm sure you have buzz .
buzz fazeli .	theo .
i know your face , you 're an up-and-comer . you bowl on the tour .	i 'm not on the tour this year .
need some advice , huh .	well , mr. fazeli , the bowling congress says i 'm a thorn in their side .
i got suspended when i was young , too . i was pretty cocky in my day .	they suspended me for 100 years .
100 years !	i can appeal in five . i was hoping you could help me mr. fazeli .
what do you think i can do ?	i need a sponsor to get my sanction card back . where i come from , you 're the king .
sure , around here , any fat old bald guy could be king . i 'm nothing . it would n't do any good for me to talk to the congress . hey , you thirsty ? you like orange whips ?	i 've never had orange whips , i 'm from akron .
remember the finals in akron in '59 ? you had a seven-ten split in the final frame .	yeah , against that prick vandemark .
ten thousand to one , but you pegged it . the toughest shot on the last frame .	that game was before you was born .
orange whip , nectar of the bowling gods . thanks sweetie . millie turns the tray so that buzz takes the untainted whip . theo takes the other glass .	thanks .
where 'd you get this ball ?	it 's mine .
who gave it to you ?	grace skinner .
grace skinner . who 's grace skinner to you ?	she 's my mom .
who are you ? who sent you here ?	i 'm your son . you 're a hard father to find .
i do n't know no grace skinner .	you knew her . you married her in 1963 .
you 're a bullshit artist , that 's what you are . you got no right to be here ! theo yanks the trophy away from buzz .	i got a right . you 're my father .
millie left to stay with her sister in ronkonkoma .	you know what a mixer ball is ? it 's like you , you come out of nowhere and upset things , scattering everything all over . buzz grumpily waves at him to sit .
what are you doing over at the lanes that 's so dangerous , buzz ?	you should n't listen to her , she 's a nervous old nellie .
she thinks someone 's trying to kill you .	i could n't pay someone enough to try to kill me . sheila comes over to take their orders .
theo .	theo ! this is sheila kastle , my partner 's daughter .
watch out for that one . she 's got a great average , but she 's looking for a prince . and , believe me , she 's	kissed a lotta tadpoles . listen , i been thinking about your problem . i 'm not the guy to sponsor you . it would be unethical . but , there is something i could do for you . putt-putt golf .
it 's the next level , the next dimension ... ... the small ball .	the small ball .
it 's gon na be bigger than big . think europe . think asia . they do n't have room for real golf courses in japan .	not for me . miniature golf 's for pansies .
if the japanese are pansies , then pansies are my kind of people . sheila steps over to the booth with their food . the buzz burger has three holes cut in the middle to make it look like a bowling ball . buzz sees the two sleazeballs park their car and walk towards the diner .	maybe i could bowl in japan .
what the fuck is this ?	what 's it look like to you ?
i do what i got ta do to survive .	you have no right to call yourself a bowler . buzz slaps theo in the face .
i 'm more of a bowler than you 'll ever be . i deal with my own shit . i ai n't asking anyone to bail me out .	i 'm your blood .
what makes you so sure it was me ? she coulda had lotsa bowlers ! theo rushes buzz and grabs his arm . the two men struggle for the pin .	do n't say that about my mom !
i had a career . she wanted a little bowler of her own . sid and breeze leap into the fray , prying the two men apart . they wrestle theo against a wall , pressing his face into the tiles .	fuck you and fuck bowling .
that 's a laugh . you 're all strung out . you 're a bowling junkie .	i do n't need the stinking pro-tour .
theo , i want you to get out of this town .	i 'm getting to like it here .
did that porcupine say he 'd get you back on the tour ?	i got ta survive .
he 'll be a barnacle on your ass the rest of your life .	you got a better offer ?
no ...	i did n't think so .
not for somebody who hit a man with his ball on national television .	that 's right , buzz , and you know when i did it ? last match , last frame . all i needed was one spare for the crown - and i get stuck with the seven-ten , the fazeli split .
you never even took the shot . you could n't do it . theo moves towards buzz in a threatening manner .	i was beaten on a shot named after my own dad . the moment passes . theo turns and climbs into his car . he looks up at buzz .
look , kid , gim me a break . i 'm an old man . i 'm runnin ' on a delrin aorta . i 'm finished - dead from my ankles up .	i could n't care less .
we ai n't married no more .	he says that to all his wives .
the whole world thinks you 're underground .	i am underground .
it could just as easily have been me in that box .	i told you to get lost . you forced yourself into this mess , so the mess accommodated you . buzz straightens out and carefully remolds the bent out of shape halo .
what about bowling ?	bowling died for me years ago . besides , i 'm a living dead legend . i 'm a hero .
so , eh , you never saw me . right ?	i never saw you .
thanks , kid . where are you goin ' now ?	i 'm goin ' straight . no more short cuts . theo gets into the car . buzz leans in the open window .
listen , if straight does n't work out , you come work for me . just make sure nobody 's following you . buzz 's face is eerily lit by the glow of the sunset , his halo bouncing in the breeze .	i did n't mean that stuff i said . i was trying to keep you out of this muddle . i 'm glad i did n't have my tubes tied . oh , and by the way , i made a call for you before i - uh - retired . buzz takes his card and scrawl on the back with a gold pen .
you give ed klein of the american bowling congress a call . tell him your maynard 's boy . he 's expecting you , and he owes me . he 'll getcha back in like flynn . do n't say i never gave you nothing .	see ya 'round maynard .
oh sure . let everyone in . from now on i leave the door wide open . let the parade begin !	clam it !
he 's the guy buzz .	he 's not the guy , millie . just whip the whips .
i looked in his car . he 's got pictures of you , clippings , maps .	bowlers do n't go around killing other bowlers . he 's only a fan , millie . i 'll give him some tips and an autograph and he 's outta here .
you 're in trouble , are n't you buzz ? you 're doing something dangerous in that alley .	millie , i know what i 'm doing .
son ?	millie , please . i do n't have a son . i think you better leave now young man . buzz gestures towards the front door .
my poor baby !	you see what you did ? take your ball and get out .
hello ?	hello , mom ?
theodore ? where are you ? are you alright ?	i found dad .
he 's dead , is n't he . buzz fazeli might just as well have died before you were born .	mom , you know i had to do it . i just did it a little too late .
you sure you 're ok teddy ? you 're not bowling are you ?	i got ta go . love ya mom .
do n't tell me , john .	cool !
theo . howzitgoin .	hey man , welcome to our parking lot . lem me give you some advice , if she asks you to dance , make sure her brother 's not around . somebody blew out junior 's pilot light , if you get my meaning .
how 's that ?	i was doing the lambada with her and the guy freaks , he breaks my arm , tries to kill me . i swear man , the guy thought i was a piata . if nobody else had n't a been there , he would n't have stopped . he woulda killed me . fuckin ' guy man , just snapped . how do you like your burger ?
uh ... over easy .	i 'll tell you one thing , you wo n't see me around that alley with that freak on the loose . stay away from his ass - and do n't play any of his fuckin ' knock-knock jokes .
i do n't like to talk about it .	you 're prone to violent outbursts , are n't you ?
it depends .	it feels good to let it out , does n't it ? sheila leans over and whispers furiously to her father .
knock-knock .	who 's there ?
who 's there !	buzz fazeli .
no . i say knock-knock ! you say who 's there . i say who 's there and then you say who who . you 're not playing right . knock-knock .	who 's there ?
junior ! you 're supposed to say junior who ! i 'm going to have to hurt you . theo and junior circle one another .	you should n't touch her .
no , junior , you should n't touch her .	nobody touches her . except me . i touch her . sheila told me you played bouncy- bouncy with her .
what did your dad tell you to do to buzz ? theo scrambles up the lane on hands and knees . junior catches him , grabbing his ankles .	he told me to play blue-face with buzz . i like games .
what did you do to buzz ?	you played bouncy-bouncy with sheila , so i 'm gon na play blue-face with you .
it 's not so bad . when i 'm alone , it feels like someone else . sheila grabs the bottle from junior , opens it and pours some on her shish kebab . she leans over and whispers furiously to her father .	do you have to get your hooks into every guy i 'm interested in ?
come on sheila , knock-knock .	who 's there ?
junior .	junior who ?
junior 's a problem child . he has a thing about -	sheila !
come on , junior . everyone 's waiting for you , son . the beam of light catches junior 's face . he is crouched inside the machine at lane six . jr. his face is cut and bleeding and his straitjacket torn and filthy .	needs lubrication . lubrication .
we 're having a party for you , boy . cake and shish-k-bob , just like you love . junior cringes away from the light .	you made me hurt him !
i have someone for you to play with junior .	someone wants to play with me ?
i have someone for you to play blueface with junior .	blueface ! blueface is my favorite .
weird , comes into alleys and does n't bowl .	it 's not an `` alley '' . i hate when people call it a `` bowling alley '' , it 's so common ! i prefer `` bowling center '' .
someone gon na get kacked , boss ?	if i find out buzz is comin ' up short on dwarf bowling , it 's lights out for him and pink slips for you . sid and breeze look sideways at each other .
hey , enough fun and games . we have work to do . come on junior . kastle heads for his car . junior gets up and follows . the two sleazeballs tarry as theo stands .	if junior thinks you 're doing the bouncy- bouncy with his sister , he 's gon na tap dance on your spleen .
buzz has been moving the cash out in hollow bowling pins . sid and breeze throw sideways glances at each other .	no !
so you 're buzz 's boy . i 've been expecting you . you hurt my feelings when you did n't come and see me sooner .	you know who i am ?
nobody sticks a finger into a bowling ball in this town without miles kastle knowing about it . you do n't mind if i have a word with theo , do you bunny ? kastle takes theo by the elbow and pulls him away .	i heard you 've been having a little trouble with the congress . theo pulls his eyes off sheila . kastle walks theo past pairs of bowlers .
you might say i 'm at the top of their shit list .	maybe i can help you . try a lighter ball , penelope - you 'll get hurt with that big ball , honey . i 've seen tapes of you bowling on the circuit . you got fazeli blood running through you . your pop was a genuine talent in his day .
what 's with the bad air between you two , mr. kastle ?	it 's nothing , just a slight business imbalance . how 's gloria 's thumb ?
that 's some pinfall . almost a 133 average . her ball 's flat , she needs to work on her spin control .	that 's right , did n't you have a slight control problem in a recent tournament , champ ? now go take out your `` big four '' , darling . come on , we 're making her nervous .
think of this business like a big aquarium . you got ta have some sharks to eat the dirt at the bottom so the guppies can swim free at the top .	profits down there , philanthropy up here . besides , it beats the pants off bingo .
nice set-up .	if it springs a leak , it 'll be because buzz is making waves .
what if he wants to get out ?	he 's earned an early retirement . but enough about losers ; buzz fazeli is history . lets talk about your future . i wan na show you something .
rac . r-a-c. renovate , automate , computerize . that , my boy , is the future . one of the monitors shows a little girl bowling . her ball moves so slowly it barely tips over the first pin . kastle hits a key and the pins explode in an emphatic strike . the little girl jumps with joy .	what ever happened to just bowling ?
there 's a lot of competition for amusement out there . you got ta adapt to survive .	i like the sport the way it is .
a guy like you could breathe some fire into bowling . you got ambition like a ... like a ... blowtorch . you go for what you want and anything that gets in your way - pssshht ! - shish kebabs . maybe lady fate washed you up on my doorstep for your own good . i think i could help you , theo .	how mr. kastle ?
you need a sponsor ; i have influence . i could sponsor you .	why would you help me ?
you already have a partner mr. kastle . sheila walks over as the sleazeballs ' car pulls out of the driveway .	i think buzz is retiring soon . in fact , i think he 's retiring tonight . kastle pulls out a shiny gold credit card and holds it in front of sheila .
where 's junior ?	he killed your stoolie embezzler father , and he 's gon na kill you next ! sid and breeze push him towards the van as the crowd 's murmur increases . kastle turns and yells over his shoulder .
dad , this is ridiculous . just open it .	ssssh ! now real quiet . on three . one ... two ... three !
i bet you did n't know that you and junior have something in common , theo : junior ca n't bowl anymore either . is n't that right junior ? kastle slams the ketchup bottle down on junior 's right hand . the table settings jump from the shock . junior sits impassively , his face a blank .	see ! no feeling . tell theo what happened to your hand , junior .
after we eat , dad .	he stuck it in the ball return machine when he was a kid . crushed all the nerve endings . junior starts stroking the ketchup bottle with his dead hand .
you 're just like you mother ! always jealous !	that 's why mom ran away , because you had to control everything !
you 're using theo for your own deviant purposes !	look who 's talking !
leave him alone !	just because your mother signed part ownership of the lanes over to you , does n't mean you have a right to tell me how to run my business ! i can have my lawyers take that deed away from you like that . sheila and kastle sit up .
fantastic ! what talent .	you still got the touch junior .
do n't go near the bowling alley .	bowling `` center '' !
hello , mr.kastle .	hello , violet . how 's my favorite 'bowlerina ' doing ?
132 , 154 .	you keep that up carmelita and one day you 'll be a champion just like mr. skinner here . what do you think , theo ? think carmelita 's got the stuff ?
i get them while they 're young . builds loyalty .	she hit it , mr. kastle !
i just hold it loosely with both hands ?	that 's right , sugar , find the grip that 's right for you . then grasp firmly . the camera weaves past a five foot pink whale with a gaping green mouth leading onto a mini-green .
grasp firmly . then what ?	line up where you want it .
yeah .	now swing it out a little to the right ...
like this ?	no , no , that 's too far . try a more gentle stroke . it 's all in the stroke . go ahead , now , honey - stroke . as the camera comes around the side of the whale , we see an elderly man in a fire hydrant red sports coat and white slacks hunched over a diminutive fiftyish woman . his back is to the camera and he is wearing a baseball cap with a plastic halo attached to it .
hole in one ! you 're the queen of stroke !	yippy !
is mr. fazeli in please ?	who wants to know ? zeus !
i 'm a bowler .	i 'm sick of you people . why do n't you leave him be ?
get that outta your mouth !	they suspended me .
he 's not here .	i 'm sorry about zeus , millie .
this is a sign ! someone 's coming to take buzz away from me . i do n't know if you 're the guy or what , but i 'm not letting it happen . i 'm leaving him first .	i could n't kill buzz . i need his help . theo helps millie load suitcases into the trunk of her car .
buzz fazeli never helps anybody but himself .	he 's my father , millie .
careful with that one . he wo n't tell me anything , but i know there 's something strange going on over at the lanes . if you ask me , i 'd say the old fart wants to die .	where can i find him ?
what 's your specialty ?	whips ... orange whips .
then i 'll have the number four with one of your finest whips .	how do you want it ? the eggs .
uh ... over easy .	coming right up .
do those two work for your dad or mine ?	mine , and they never tip .
do you know where they 're taking him ?	yeah , babylon . buzz runs the lanes there for my dad . everybody who has anything to do with bowling in this town answers to my dad . theo splits .
here theo , it 's the fazeli specialty ; a seven-ten split . theo looks down the lane and sees the two pins standing .	i 'm not here to - i ca n't ...
i came here to have a word with your dad .	what do you want with my dad ?
business .	wo n't your father help you with that ?
having a legend for a dad is n't all it 's cracked up to be .	your dad 's one of the only nice people in this fucking town . my dad is slime . kastle walks over . theo stands up and shakes kastle 's proffered hand .
this is a vicious cycle .	i think that a motorbike is one of the last really free things that people can do .
is n't this technically a scooter ?	when i 'm on my bike i feel like a wild person . better than any sex i 've ever had .
kinda tough on the butt .	everything has it 's drawbacks .
where did your brother escape from ?	the mental hospital .
what does he do ?	he follows me , he tries to have sex with me , and then they send him to the nut-hut for a while and then he gets out and then he follows me , he tries to have sex with me , they send him to the nut-hut for a while ...
whoa .	it 's a vicious cycle .
mind if i cut in ?	no , not at all .
you and your sideburns are the talk of the party , theo .	the ladies in akron call them thigh- ticklers .
can i ask you something personal ?	i 'd rather you did n't .
do you have a girlfriend ?	not while i 'm in training .
do you have a boyfriend ?	no . do you ?
so this brother of yours is hazardous to the health of your dates ?	nobody in this town really understands junior . when i went to family sessions for him i realized he was the sanest one in the family . actually , he 's the only one in this whole fucking town who knows exactly who he is and what he wants .
unfortunately what he wants is you .	so , what about you ?
do i want you ?	we 'll get into that later .
theo , what would you do if you could n't bowl ?	i do n't know . it 's all i ever wanted to do .
i wanted to be a motocross champion . my folks did n't really care what i did . then junior blew a fuse and i became their last hope . most girls get ballet stuffed down their throats , i got bowling . i never understood how anyone could take it so seriously . i hope i 'm not insulting you .	no , i 'm fascinated .
why were you suspended ?	i used to be kind of wild . they used to call me the bad boy of bowling .
so you 're hoping buzz can get you re- instated ?	well , that was plan a .
what 's plan b ?	plan b is your dad .
what do you think my dad 's gon na do for you ?	he said he 'd sponsor me .
ha ! and what do you have to do for him ?	nothing .
oh really ? nothing ? my dad does n't do anything unless there 's something in it for him .	he asked me to keep an eye on you for a couple of days .
what ? be my body guard ? here 's my body , theo . guard it . for my dad 's sake . for your career . sheila starts to unbutton her bowling shirt .	sheila , please .
come on theo , what about plan c ?	what 's plan c ?
i do n't think your new outfit suits you , theo .	really ? i kinda like it .
do you talk with your mom ?	it 's been awhile . she did n't want me looking for my dad .
my mom told me not to stay in this town .	so why do you stay ?
i 'm a credit card junkie . i went on a binge and my dad bailed me out . now i 'm trapped in his easy payment plan .	i bet you get to meet a lot of eligible bowlers .
yeah , but they 're all little wannabes . i 'm looking for a professional man .	i may not be a pro bowler , but i 'm no amateur man . sheila moves closer to theo .
how much would you charge me for the lips ?	more than you could afford .
come on , bargain with me .	i could let them go for ten .
you professional men drive a hard bargain . i 'm afraid i only have five on me . sheila pulls out a 5 dollar bill .	if you want a professional man , you have to be willing to pay for him .
what are you going to do about your brother ?	you 're here .
then it 's true , is n't it ? about ...	... lane six . yes .
it would n't bother you if buzz was in danger , would it ?	nope , i could n't care less .
i 'm sure you would n't care if he needed your help , right ?	why should i help that old fuck .
yeah , what did buzz fazeli ever do for you ?	zip .
and besides , it 's probably too late , anyhow .	way too late . buzz fazeli is history . too late for what ?
nothing .	too late for what , sheila ?
you know how people with broken bones know when there 's a storm coming ?	you got any broken bones ?
no , but something 's gon na blow in this town . i can feel it .	are you fucking with me sheila ? is something gon na happen to buzz ? sheila seems to be trying to tell theo , but is unable .
i ca n't tell you , theo .	why not ?
i saw your eyes when you hit that guy with your ball on tv . thunder rumbles . theo takes sheila by the shoulders .	tell me , sheila . what are you afraid of ? sheila shakes her head .
i 'm afraid you 'll hurt him .	it 's junior , is n't it .
i ca n't - i ca n't do it . he 's my brother .	he 's my father .
these open the back door . do n't let him catch you behind the machines ; if he does , you 're trapped . i 'll meet you at the bridge . theo takes the keys . sheila grabs his arm .	you do n't have to do this . we could just cut out of here , go to akron , or anywhere else .
you told junior that we did it .	it ?
it . bouncy-bouncy . fucked . he tried to squeeze my fucking head off . what did you say to him ? when they reach each other , they stop . sheila seems to weigh her answer .	i told him you were my boyfriend .
what the hell did you go doing that for sheila ? we have n't even gotten naked yet !	we would have sooner or later .
oh great ! he tried to kill me ! you knew he would go off if he thought i fooled around with you .	did you - kill him ?
how do you get this thing down ?	tell me what happened theo .
you wanted me to kill him , did n't you ?	if he 's not dead , he 'll keep coming back .
he 's dead sheila .	i feel sick .
you should .	are you sure he 's dead ?
where are you going ?	i think your brother may have already gotten to buzz . he gets into his car .
can i come with you ?	i did your dirty work for you sheila , now fuck off . theo drives away leaving sheila standing alone . she watches his car recede with a thoughtful expression , then turns on her heel .
why did you come back ?	when i 'm with you sheila , i do n't even think about bowling . theo takes sheila in his arms and kisses her passionately . she stops him and looks around nervously .
if junior finds us , he 'll kill us both .	i killed him once , i 'll just have to kill him again .
you do n't get two chances with junior .	at least i 'll die smiling .
say something , theo . give me something . a doll 's legs catch fire . theo stares into sheila 's eyes .	plan c. from now on it 's gon na be plan c. both bodies throb and grind , their sandy hands sliding over each others ' sweaty skin .
theo , buzz is dead .	i did n't come this far to bury a guy that 's not my dad . he owes me .
back to plan a. the vicious cycle all over again . theo lets go of sheila .	i 've been trapped by miles kastle my whole life . she walks over to her scooter , and mounts it .
now he 's the one who 's locked up and i 'm the one who 's free . if i got ta do this alone , i might as well start now . she revs up and peals out .	sshheeiillaaa !
what makes you think you know me so well that you can give me an ultimatum ? huh ?	who said anything about an ultimatum ? you want to find your father ? get a shovel and start digging . hurry up , he 's probably in purgatory by now . sheila makes a pathetic attempt to speed away from theo . he moves up beside her again .
you 're really pissing me off .	i 'm pissing you off ? i 'm doing what i said i 'd do . what the hell are you doing ? what about your word ?
my word is good , and it 'll always be good . when did i ever give my word to you ?	what about plan c ?
fuck plan c !	your word is so good , you 're never gon na give it to anyone .
you think i 'm dumping you to get back into bowling . well who 's dumping who ?	i 'm not dumping you , i 'm suspending you .
sez you !	suck my dick !
very professional .	i am a professional man .
lips still for sale ?	you bet . for five bucks , i 'll even throw in the tongue .
lane 's closed big fellah , league night .	i 'm not here to bowl .
you drag that coconut around for your health , or do you know how to use it ?	i 'm looking for somebody .
some unfinished business .	if you wan na do business in this town , there 's other people around here got more weight than old faz .
you guys got something going on downstairs ?	we provide some extracurricular activities for the senior citizens in the community .
aagh ! stop ! those are my bowling fingers !	tell your little pal to let go .
very good , busyboy .	dwarf bowling 's illegal .
you should probably hit the road . go home . this place could get hazardous for your health .	so , buzz was stooling for you guys .
why is junior 's watch in that coffin ? something stinks around here .	your time is up , busyboy .
who identified the body ?	the body was identified along proper bowling congress guidelines for processing a bowling related fatality .
you faked my dad 's murder . you used him ! where is he ! theo chases sid and breeze around their car . he catches sid and grabs the middle fingers on his right hand . sid howls .	ow ! ooh ! no , please ! doc said i 'd be back on the planks in a week ! show him breeze ! breeze pulls a copy of `` new york bowler '' from his pocket . the headline reads `` rub out ! : bowling legend kacked by dwarfscam kingpin '' with a photo of buzz fazeli .
captain , open the hatch door , please ... the hatch door , captain . open it , please .	calm down , dr. levine .
let me out , captain . open the door !	please , dr. levine .
... your civil rights have been overridden !	open it , captain !
fletcher ? what are you doing out there ?	they 're like pink snow , sir . sticky .
they 're warm . i can feel the heat on my legs .	fletcher , i want you back here .
fletcher , get away from there ...	it 's burning ...
get out of there !	i ca n't see ...
fletcher ! now !	i ca n't ...
how big is this spacecraft ?	of what we 're able to measure , roughly twenty-six hundred feet .
in basic english , what does all this mean ?	basic english ? there 's no way this spacecraft was constructed on our planet .
there 's heat coming the door .	back away then .
wait a minute --	i said back away .
hold on --	what is it ?
alright , beth , do that thing you did before .	how about i just press the button ?
not everything . even on earth . take ... yeasts .	yeasts ? thank you , beth , but i do n't think we 're gon na open it up and find a loaf of bread .
i am not leaving without him . do you hear me ? we come down as a team , we leave as a team .	what are you -- his mother ? get norman , i want everyone ready to go . edmunds , the subs ?
norman !	edmunds , do you have a 20 on norman ?
the surface ships will be back . after the storm clears .	how long will that be ?
they told me about sixty hours .	two and a half days ?
back at the door -- i asked you to back away .	yeah . i heard you .
there are procedures , beth , that i want followed . my procedures . and considering what 's going on , i want you to follow them very closely .	forgive me . i 've never read the navy manual . i wonder what it says about bathroom and shower procedures .
nobody move .	but she 's --
i 'm not sure . i 've never seen anything like it .	you 're a fucking biochemist , are n't you ? ca n't you tell us something .
nice work , captain sir .	shut up , beth . i do n't want to hear it .
direction 's east coming !	what was that ?
a squid ? the size of a whale ? i do n't think so . target acquired . sixty yards .	what if it attacks ?
fifty yards and closing .	what do we use for defense ?
we 're a habitat . not a castle . the only defense we have is high voltage .	high voltage ?
it sends 200 volts throughout the cylinder surface . but we 've never used it underwater before .	forty yards .
but you 've tested it ?	sure . each time it started fires inside the habitat .
thirty yards .	what are you saying -- we ca n't stop what 's out there ?
where is it ?	why ca n't i -- ? what the hell is going on here ?
what was that ?	he 's right beneath us .
increase positive pressure !	that 's our reserve air .
do n't do it , norman !	do you see it ?
do n't pull it , norman . it 'll start a < u > fire < /u > we ca n't stop . norman ?	do it , norman , it 's the only choice we have . this thing is gon na crush us .
do n't do it !	now !
norman , please ! do n't !	pull it , damn it !
thank you , colonel .	captain .
well , thanks for the opportuninty here -- my wife appreciates it .	do n't thank me , dr. johnson . you were n't my choice . the pentagon made me take you .
come with me . the team 's already waiting .	what team ?
what have you been told so far ?	the usual . plane crash . survivers unknown . routine stuff really .
anything else ?	nothing else .
you talk to any reporters ? any press ?	press ? no , i have n't .
good . security 's been our biggest worry . now that you 're here we can shut this thing down tight .	from what ? what 's with all the security ?
we 're moving fast considering the storm .	storm ? what storm ?
a cyclone 's on it 's way in . i thought they would have told you on the phone .	they did n't tell me anything .
how deep is he ?	a thousand feet .
a thousand ? an airplane crashes into a thousand feet of water -- i do n't want to sound pessimistic here , but i assume there are no survivors .	survivors ? no , i would n't think so .
then why am i here ?	what ?
what is it ? a military spacecraft ? like a shuttle or satellite ?	something like that . that does n't surprise you ?
not really , no . something of the military crashes in the ocean -- it explains why there was nothing on the news , why you 've kept everything a secret ... when did it crash ?	as best we can estimate , it crashed four hundred years ago .
see this ? coral . geologists measured the coral growth on top of the craft to be over five meters thick .	geologists ?
coral grows at a rate of two and a half centimeters a year --	-- wait a second --
-- dating the crash at least that old .	hold on --
maybe older --	-- there 's got to be some mistake here -- a four hundred year old military spacecraft ? there 's no such thing ... our space program is n't even forty years old .
extraordinary , is n't it ?	it 's impossible .
off the record , i do n't mind telling you , this thing scares the shit out of me .	it does n't make any sense .
we think it might . that 's why we brought you here . we 've assembled your team -- they 're waiting for us now .	what team ?
the one you recommended . in the ulf report you wrote for the bush administration .	ulf report ? nobody 's mentioned that in years . you mean someone actually read it ?
your report 's become our bible down here , dr. johnson . we 've been carrying out each of your recommendations -- one by one -- to the smallest detail .	but sir , i do n't understand . this report -- these recommendations ... they 're for an encounter with extra- terrestrial life .
they pressurize us with helium .	what 's wrong with oxygen ?
what is it , norman ?	take a look .
picked up something ? what is it ?	i do n't know . but it 's something alien .
maybe we should n't .	what ?
like `` thou shall not kill '' ?	or maybe , it ca n't < u > be < /u > killed .
you mean , what 's in that thing is immortal ?	i do n't know . that 's the point .
do n't get hysterical , norman .	i 'm telling you , harry 's lost it . he 's saying there 's a deathwish out for each of us .
look , the ships are clearing out . they 're taking us topside in a matter of minutes . someone can check him out there , if it 's that imprtant .	all i 'm saying is , someone should keep an eye on him .
harry 's missing .	what do you mean , he 's missing ?
he 's missing . he 's gone . he left .	he 's here somewhere . find him . the sub 's on it 's way . go ! c'mon !
you ca n't just leave harry down here , sir .	i told you people , nobody goes anywhere unless i say .
but sir --	no `` buts '' . if he wants to be left , we 'll leave him . hello ? yes , the subs -- i want a report ... hello ... yes , a report . gim me ... shit .
i 'm not paranoid . i know beth . she can be drastic .	how drastic ?
you do n't want to know .	i think i do .
a while back , beth and i -- we worked at the same university . she was assisting a chemist there -- i forget his name -- doing research , experiments . she was also living with him . yeah , i know . and when she finished her work , he kicked her out , broke off the relationship , and published five papers -- all her work -- without any thank you or acknowledgement .	she should 've known better .
she put a razor to her wrists a day later .	when was this ?
'81 , i think . she tried again five years ago . i thought you should know .	so you knew this when you wrote your report ?
at the time , i do n't know , i thought putting her on the list -- it might help her career -- catch her a break .	you knowingly recommended a woman with suicidal tendencies for a government operation --
wait a second --	-- and then brought her down here --
-- i did n't know it would come to this --	-- without a cautionary word to anyone . you know , ted said something to me earlier . i think he 's right . he said , `` when you got a guy who -- if he was n't here -- he 'd be standing in the unemployment line , you got ta question if you got the right guy . ''
he translated it wrong . `` my name is jerry '' ? it 's like `` see spot run . ''	the message does n't show a lack of intelligence . it 's smart . it 's approaching us in a simple way . like you would a dog . holding out your hand , letting it sniff , get used to you .
great , okay . ask him about his weapons .	that 's smart . let 's talk about guns and violence .
you do n't think weapons are important ?	i think we should be careful . consider his emotional response .
edmunds ?	because if jerry is powerful and also emotional ...
damn it , edmunds ?	... it raises a very serious question : < u > what happens if jerry < /u > < u > gets mad < /u > ?
what for ?	if something should happen to us , the navy will at least have partial records of what happened .
i do n't want you talking to jerry .	but sir , i think it 's imperative . i think the messages , the animals we 've seen , what killed edmunds , the reading you got earlier -- i think they 're all related .
you think he killed edmunds ?	yes , i do . whatever 's out there , i think is his response to us refusing to talk to him earlier .
bullshit . what 's out there is n't alien . it 's an animal .	maybe so . but i think we need to ask jerry about it .
going active .	jerry ?
what the hell ? it shut us down .	jerry ? please . stop this .
yes , sir . i 'm here .	you see the lever on the green box ? upper right hand corner ?
i see it .	pull it .
can you open that panel ?	working on it now , sir .
it 's not sucking , sir .	thank you , i can see that . try something else .
we do n't have anything else to try , sir .	well , shit -- find something , do something ... make something up --
what caused it ?	nothing . i do n't know . everything was normal . no changes at all .
get him out of there . i thought i told you people --	harry ? can you copy ?
subs are still at surface , sir .	send them , damn it ! i know , but i 'm not gon na be held responsible --
i 'm getting no sub reading , sir .	they 're coming .
any sign of harry ?	nothing , sir .
nothing , sir .	what the hell is going on here ?
yes , sir .	well , where the fuck is he ?
sir , if the subs have n't left by now ...	they 've left , keep watching !
norman , get out of there now ! norman ?	if the subs are n't here yet , sir --
edmunds , get in here . i need you for this .	in a minute , sir .
how much damage ?	to the craft ? none . not a scratch .
right . so you 're saying it survived a high speed impact with water without a scratch ?	i 'm not saying anything , harry , i 'm just stating the facts . the outer metal is made of a titanium alloy , built into an epoxy- resin honeycomb . the necessary technology to bond this type of metal has never been invented .
it 's chipped .	chipped ? the door ? how can it be chipped ?
i do n't know how it can be chipped , but it 's chipped .	i thought you said there was n't any damage done in the crash ?
i did .	then how can it be chipped ?
ted ? captain ?	yes , harry .
we know how this craft got here . where it 's been .	so do we . and it seems to have picked up something on it 's travels .
no . they do n't represent a message . they are n't decorative at all . they have another purpose entirely .	what ?
to conceal a small break in the surface of the sphere .	a break for what ?
so how do we get it open ?	ted seems to have some ideas .
man is man , all he knows is man , and all he can think of is what he knows . the anthropomorphic problem . good , norman .	the what ?
so ? what 's the problem ?	it 's nonsense . there 's enough difference between our own species to prove that .
or it could contain some great benefit to us , some astonishing new idea or technology to help mankind .	it could . but the odds of it being any use to us are against it .
you do n't know that .	let 's say whoever made this thing is a thousand years ahead of us , just like we are to , say , medieval europe . suppose you went back to medieval europe with a tv set . there would n't be any place to plug it in .
gim me a report , i want --	ladies and gentlemen ...
who is that ? where 's that coming from ?	please watch your closest monitor ...
it 's a single sequence repeated over and over .	we 're all very proud of you , harry , but what the hell is it ?
... spiralling out of the center , you see : `` g '' is one , `` b '' is two , `` h '' is three , and so on ... when i got the message .	what 's the message ?
i have to tell you . it 's strange .	how do you mean , strange ?
ignorant . the thing 's ignorant .	it 's not ignorant .
are you enjoying yourself , harry , because i do n't know what the hell you 're doing .	he understands me fine .
not now , beth . please . i want to know who we 're talking to before we start talking . where 's edmunds ?	she 's not gon na know , sir .
what ?	he 's saying , `` take me to your leader . '' he wants to know who 's in charge .
with an `` o '' . harold with an `` o '' .	what -- you want me to retype it ?
edmunds ? get in here . i want to know exactly how this is being transmitted .	she 's not gon na know .
she wired this system .	if the technology of that sphere is advanced enough -- the way it functions is gon na appear to us like magic .
a half a mile long ?	the wing dimension alone is larger that any aircraft we 've seen .
captain , you know , i really appreciate you hauling us a thousand feet below sea level so we can watch this historical event on television .	nobody goes inside , until we know < u > what 's < /u > inside .
i 'd also like it noted --	duly noted , ted . edmunds , try using suction .
what < u > about < /u > a crowbar ?	what if we go out there , you know -- wedge a crowbar in the door and pry the thing open .
ted , get her away from the door .	what are you going to do -- shoot her ?
look at this .	what is it ?
some sort of lead or something .	radiation shield , you think ?
what 's wrong ?	what do you make of this ?
we had considered it .	considered what ? that it 's american ? how would you think it 's american ?
time travel . i always thought it was one of those myths ... like santa 's reindeer .	what would we be working on in the future that would make us want to come back ?
but what does it do ? this ... sphere .	maybe it 's a message of some sort , you know ? see this red here .
can i stay , sir ? i 'm willing to risk it . i am . after what we just witnessed .	what ? no , i know they 're civilians ...
did you hear me , sir , because --	ted , shut up . are you packed ? ready to go ? i want everyone packed . now !
how can he be missing ?	sir , about leaving --
they switched us over .	to what ?
she says jellyfish are a delicacy . you know , i never knew that .	get out of there . i do n't want anyone going anywhere outside , understood ?
from the sphere ?	what 's inside the sphere .
i want a name . a real name . this thing 's full name , rank and serial number .	captain , i personally feel we should ask much more substantive questions --
it 's not talking , it 's mimicking .	give him a chance . he 's speaking our language , not the other way around .
edmunds ?	do n't make stuff up , these emotional theories , just so you can feel important here .
what is that ?	the sensors are picking up something outside .
it wo n't register . it 's too big to image .	too big ?
well , until we know exactly what it is , nobody goes outside , understood ?	what was edmunds doing outside ?
resetting the sub .	what sub ?
beth , look , can i trust you with a little secret ?	i love secrets .
that ulf report everybody 's patting me on the back about ?	i 've read it twice , norman . it 's brilliant .
it 's bullshit . the report 's a joke .	that 's quite a secret .
do yourself a favor , norman . are you listening ? do n't tell anyone what you just told me .	c'mon , beth -- that report 's like the blind leading the blind .
because when we get down there --	wait -- down where ?
to the spacecraft . to investigate .	underwater ?
what do you expect ? for them to bring it up here ?	we ca n't go down there . we 're not prepared . that deep ? that takes years of training , beth . we 're just scientists . lab scietists . we wear ties and lab coats to work -- not oxygen tanks .
well , you must have realized the chances an encounter like this would happen here . in the ocean . 70 percent of the earth 's surface is water , norman . that 's first grade geography .	it never occurred to me .
well , let 's pray that 's the only mistake you made . have you said anything to barnes about this ?	the timing has never seemed quite right .
just keep your mouth shut , alright ? this could mean everything to our careers , you know that ? do n't jeopardize this .	what -- are you threatening me ?
is n't there a psychological term for that , dr. johnson ?	yeah . drowning .
you 're next , norman .	no . go ahead . really . ladies first .
400 years ago ? i 'm sure christopher columbus would 've loved these accomodations .	good theory , ted .
norman !	get this thing off me .
it could breathe in air and exhale cyanide gas .	disrupt our brain waves , interfere with our ability to think .
where 'd this come from ?	the library .
we have a library ?	a bad one . it was the only book in there . norman , come here , look at this .
... when i was six , my younger brother and i -- we went swimming in the pacific . at my mother 's beach house . we both felt stinging , and when we came out of the water , he was wearing jellyfish head to toe . killed him .	my gosh , norman .
yeah , it was awful .	what about you ? what happened to you ?
me ? well , i was wrapped in seaweed . it itched for a while , but i survived . beth , do you find it ... curious that we 're seeing all this life down here . nothing , and then these enormous flocks of squid . then jellyfish ?	normally , i 'd say no . everything 's quiet now -- no ships , no divers , no electricity . makes sense . but what 's curious is -- these are n't normal jellyfish .
what do you mean -- not normal ?	they have six tentacles . a new species . and the squid too . they had no stomach .
wait a minute .	what ?
you knew about the squid not being normal . before fletcher went out there ?	yeah , why ?
what ? why ...	beth --
i mean , i 'm not ... i was n't absolutely sure if ... they --	they are or they are n't . which is it ?
what ? ... wait . do n't ... why are you --	beth .
nobody said ... norman ... what ? why are you looking at me like that ?	beth --
i did n't do anything wrong . i did n't mean ...	beth .
i ca n't feel her bones . she 's like a sponge .	she was crushed . feel her skin -- it 's like sandpaper .
norman .	what are they ?
... he lied to us . he left us down here .	c'mon , beth . do n't make this personal . he told me himself they were taking us back .
yeah , he < u > told < /u > you . think . what was barnes doing before they cut that cable loose ? he was on the phone . except that cable is a thousand feet long , norman . they would 've broken off communication with us four , five minutes before they cleared out .	so what ?
so who was barnes talking to at the last minute ? nobody .	you 're jumping to conclusions , beth . do n't get worked up --
`` although advised of risks , all personnel elect to remain down for duration of storm to continue investigation of alien sphere and associated spacecraft . signed , barnes , usn . ''	where did you get this ?
in edmunds ' things .	you went through edmunds ' things ?
he 's not just a navy captain -- he works for the fucking pentagon .	calm down , beth . alright ?
do n't tell me to calm down !	it 's done , alright ? it 's over ! and there 's not a damn thing we can do about it now , okay ?
you said something to him , did n't you ?	what ?
beth --	you did , did n't you ?
do n't do this .	you bastard .
yeah , okay . sure , norman .	beth --
where are you going in such a hurry ?	i have to reset the sub .
forget the sub .	do n't bother me , norman .
it 's not worth the risk .	it 's also our only way out of here ! it holds three people . and there 's only three of us left now .
you , me and harry ?	you , me and harry . he 's asleep .
wake him , then . let 's go . get outta --	we ca n't . the storm . the waves would toss us around worse than we got down here . and we have four days of decompression when we get up top .
four days ?	get the helium out of our bloodstream . we go to the surface now , we 'd pop like a soda bottle .
maybe you should go . to the sub .	why should i go ?
you should know how it works . just in case .	in case you die , too ?
i do n't trust harry to do it .	i would . but my suit --
you fixed my suit ?	you do n't trust me ?
but i do n't know how --	you press a button , norman . it 's not brain surgery . here , go ahead . you only have 15 minutes to reset it . go on , norman ...
the sub 's a 100 feet in front of you . you see it ?	i ca n't see anything . how does it look ? still clear ?
what 's the matter ?	you fixed this suit ? beth ?
yes , norman . i did . you 're just nervous .	my air is n't ... i 'm coming back .
still clear ?	still clear .
... what do you mean ? i 'm in the ship .	what are you doing in the ship ? beth ?
getting food . we were out of food . what 's wrong ? you sound mad .	yeah , well , i get that way when i 'm facing death and someone deserts me .
deserts you ? harry said he 'd take over for me .	he what ?
you get it straightened out ?	i think so , beth . yes .
what 's harry doing with your suit in there ?	fixing it .
fixing it ? but i fixed -- where 'd you get all that ?	the refridgerator .
the refridgerator .	it 's a pretty common place to look for food when you do n't think you have any .
that was n't in there before .	we must 've had it delivered then .
wait a second --	1-800-deepsea delivery . i hear they 're good .
none of this was here before .	did you look ? it was on the top shelf .
no , it was n't . i swear none of this was here . none of it . you think he hid it ? earlier . he must 've hid it .	you think ?
you do n't believe me .	all i know is i opened that refridgerator --
damn it , norman . i swear . i had a whole conversation with the man when he woke up .	this being after you so carefully fixed my suit .
you think it 's me ? you think i 'm saying there was a conversation when there was n't ?	i do n't know , beth . i was n't there .
page 87 .	what ?
`` our fisherman frequently see some that are more than four feet long . some skeletons of squids ...	squids ?
after the attack , a navy guy woke me up -- i do n't know -- i thought he was an illusion . but i checked the tape , and jerry said he manifested him .	manifested ?
he translated it wrong .	what ?
remember when we first spoke to jerry , barnes kept asking for jerry 's real name ? but harry never would ? he did n't because he was afraid the screen would say `` harry '' , instead of jerry . we were n't talking to an alien intelligence when we talked to jerry , we were talking to harry ... or a part of harry .	what do you mean , a part of harry ?
when did the messages start ? the animals outside start showing up ? after harry came out of the sphere .	you think , in the sphere --
he acquired some sort of power . a power to manifest things .	but how ?
i do n't know .	how can the sphere do that ?
i do n't know , beth . i 'm not the fucking alien that built the thing . but it can . when harry came out of the sphere , he mumbled something about page 87. how he would never read that far -- he was too scared to . then you found the book , remember in your lab . then in the cafeteria -- and page 87 talks about a giant squid ...	which i told barnes was attacking --
it 's his fear . the squid . he 's manifesting his fears . making them real .	but why is he doing it ?
he must not realize he is . like the navy crewman -- harry was sleeping then . he must 've manifested his dream .	his dream ? you ca n't control your dreams . and you ca n't control your fears , can you ?
and that 's the part of harry that 's being manifested .	must be . and if it is -- it 's a part of him not even he can control .
looks like some sort of code .	why would harry go back to using a code ?
diphenyl parlene .	something for burns .
it 's for motion sickness .	valdomet .
ulcers .	sintag .
a synthetic opium analogue .	does it cause drowsiness ? that 's all we need . to get him unconscious -- put him under .
nothing about drowsiness .	tarazine ?
tranquilizer . causes drowsiness .	bingo .
riordan ?	antihistamine . for bites .
damn it ! chloramphenicol ?	antibiotic .
parasolutrine ?	how do you spell it ?
p-a-r-a-s-o ...	it 's a soporific .
what 's that ?	causes sleep .
it 's like a sleeping pill ?	`` ... used as an anesthetic if given in combination with paracin trichloride ... ``
`` 20 cc 's of parasolutrine in combination with 6 cc 's of paracin given iv produces deep sleep suitable for emergency surgical procedures ... no cardiac side effects ... rem activity is surpressed ... ``	how long does it last ?
three to six hours .	i 'll just boost the doses .
what ? wait -- is n't that dangerous ?	how fast does it take effect ?
does n't say .	what if it takes 20 minutes , norman ? what if it takes an hour ? and he can fight it off ? we ca n't afford that .
it 's an idea .	beth --
to be on the safe side . i mean --	you want to kill him ?
you ever given an injection before .	thirty years ago . in residency . i passed out . you ?
i 'm sorry .	for what ?
not believing you .	you 're not sorry . you 're scared . you 're a psychologist , norman . you pride yourself on knowing when someone 's lying to you , not telling you the truth . and now you 're scared ... because you 're not sure you can tell anymore .
what is it , norman ?	where are you ?
the sphere looks different .	what do you mean , different ?
the grooves around the door -- they 've shifted . and the pattern -- the fluids -- they look darker now .	how 's harry ?
what was that ? i could n't hear you .	your watch .
what 's wrong , norman ?	i 'm feeling better .
it 's getting cold .	you think i 'd really drink that ?
you do n't think i put something in it , do you ?	you put explosives around the habitat , i ca n't imagine what you 'd put in a drink .
how do you feel about snakes ?	snakes ? what do you mean , exactly ?
you know what i mean .	am i afraid of them ? not during the day . sea snakes are diurnal . when the sun 's out , they do n't bite . fortunately for you , i had on my watch . this is quite good .
what are they doing down here ? in the bathroom ? suddenly appearing .	you tell me .
do you fear them ?	do n't you ?
are you manifesting them ?	if i was , then i would 've had to have gone in the sphere , would n't i ?
did you ?	what 's the phrase -- `` keeping up with the joneses '' ?
why did you go in the sphere , beth ?	same reason i put explosives around the habitat . for defense . for the power . to protect myself .
against what ? harry 's unconscious . he 's not a threat .	no , he is n't .
he ca n't manifest .	no , he ca n't .
then why , beth ? why go in ? why put out explosives ? why manifest the snakes ?	you think i manifested the snakes ?
someone did .	yes , someone did . but it was n't me , norman . it was you . you manifested the snakes .
beth you 're losing it . c'mon .	c'mon -- what ?
you 're lying --	am i lying ? are you sure ? are you absolutely sure i 'm lying ? then explain to me about the jellyfish . earlier . why did we see jellyfish ? harry does n't fear jellyfish . you do . they 're your fear , are n't they ?
but --	and the snakes ? you want to know about the snakes ? you saw one outside earlier , did n't you ? when you thought i had deserted you -- you were terrified .
that 's when you went in the sphere .	one lonely , terrifying sea snake .
you manifested that , beth .	did i ? or was that you ? when you were hiding in the bathroom -- all conspiratorially like you were -- you became frightened , did n't you ? terrified . like you were with the snake earlier -- and suddenly you have snakes slithering all over the floor . you did that , norman .
you 're insane .	am i ? or am i making so much sense that you 're going insane ?
i never went in that sphere .	you do n't remember you did . but i 'm sure you remember running like some fucking hero to get harry , do n't you ? you remember that .
yes .	you remember before you picked him up -- when you looked up at the sphere , you remember that -- when the sphere opened ? that 's right . but you ca n't remember going inside , can you ? no , of course not . harry could n't either , could he ? `` like everything 's on the tip of my tongue '' , he said .
that 's bullshit .	is it ?
beth , the message said harry . `` my name is harry '' . my name is n't harry .	no , it is n't . your name is norman . but your younger brother -- what was his name ? the one who was stung when you were younger . the one that died . the one you could n't save . what was his name ? `` mommy , we 're going out to the ocean -- to go swimming . '' `` but i do n't want to go swimming , norman . i 'm scared . '' `` c'mon , < u > harry < /u > , it 'll be fine , it 'll be fun . '' you heartless fuck . that 's why you 're so scared of the water , is n't it ?
shut up , beth --	when you were in that sub -- and that squid was attacking you -- are you sure it was the squid that was attacking ? do you know ? `` i ca n't get beth on the radio . i 'm in this tiny sub on the bottom of the fucking ocean . all alone . surrounded by all this water . '' was it really the squid that was attacking you , norman -- or was it something else -- one of your fears ? you never really saw what it was , did you ?
i 'm not scaring you , am i norman ? i hope i 'm not frightening you . the last thing i want to do is frighten you . you feel okay , do n't you ?	it 's not me , beth . i swear . it ca n't be .
do n't , beth .	but i have to , norman .
i promise --	promise what , norman ? tell me !
beth --	you think i 'd belive you ? believe anything you might say now ? after you lied to me about telling barnes about my past . about my problems . my problems . not yours . not his . mine .
do n't , beth . please .	it 's either this ... or i kill you .
it 's your choice . because it 's not safe for you to be awake . to be walking around . to be thinking about things .	it 's not safe for you to be either .
this is what i 'm talking about , norman . do n't you see ? it 's in you . this vindictiveness . this rage .	get away from the door , beth .
of course you 're going to deny it . you want to blame someone else . you want to blame beth . because you hate beth .	do n't fuck with me , beth .
beth !	you 're frightened , are n't you , norman ?
where is it coming from , beth ?	do n't you know ?
beth , stop it !	stop what ? do n't blame me . it 's not me .
then where 's it coming from ?	from you , norman . from your mind . you 're doing it .
stop it !	it 's you , norman . your fear of drowning . you have to face it .
beth ?	leave me alone , norman .
you ca n't stop it , norman . you ca n't fight me .	i know . you 're too strong , beth .
oh please , do n't shrink me , norman . not now .	i --
do n't tell me about me . i already know too much .	beth -- gim me the gun .
oh , sure . here . anything else , beth can get you ? some more chicken , perhaps . let beth check the fridge .	c'mon --
top shelf , is it ?	let 's get out of here , beth . let 's go home .
what is that ? what are you doing ?	what ?
you hear that ?	hear what ?
get away from me !	beth --
would it work ?	yes . and i think we already know it will .
how 's that ?	down below , harry said we would all have to die . since there was no evidence on that spacecraft that anybody knew time travel through a black hole was possible -- and we all knew -- then we would all have to die before we could tell anyone . death was the only logical explanation . but sitting here , we still know . so how is that possible ? unless we make ourselves forget .
pussy .	what 's that -- mistake number two , norman ?
no . i do n't think so .	well , think . because there 's footprints here that are n't mine .
i do n't get it .	it does n't make any sense .
well , what 's your theory ?	i 'm a woman . i do n't theorize . i only deal with facts .
norman ? where 's norman ?	by the bunks .
he does n't wait for an answer .	who says it 's a he ?
pry the thing open ? what are we -- neanderthals ?	all that banging and pounding . i do n't know . we should think about making a good first impression .
for who ? the fish ?	for whoever 's in that thing .
it 's empty . why would someone build a ship like this ?	you 'd have to ask them .
then what is it ?	it 's an american spacecraft .
what are you looking for ?	a light switch . a button opened that door -- the craft runs on some sort of power .
take politics , our views on abortion , the death penalty ...	cannibalism , to be extreme . and now we 're talking about a new life form . their values and ethics may be incomprehensible .
when he woke up , he said we were out of food . he told me to get some from the ship .	i never said that .
yes you did . norman , i would n't leave you out there . you know that .	we never even had a conversation , norman .
jerry . right . i said jerry , did n't i ?	that 's a hell of a mistake to make , beth .
i 'm sorry . slip of the tongue .	yeah , i do n't know how you could make that confusion .
just in time , too .	in time for what ?
what ?	just in time for what ?
our habitat , i mean . this place ca n't handle another attack .	another attack ?
why are you looking at me like that ?	like what ? i 'm not --
you 're staring at me .	no i 'm not . i 'm not star --
they 're going to want answers and they 're going to keep asking until they get them .	we can refuse to talk .
when did it come across ?	minutes ago . harry 's trying to decode it in his room now .
where 's it coming from ?	no idea . we have no surface support . it transmitted too fast to be coming from underwater .
is it coming from our own computer ?	harry thinks it 's some sort of discharge from our own system , but i 've seen it discharge before -- and it did n't look anything like this .
how are you feeling , norman ?	what ?
you holding up alright ?	fine . i 'm fine .
do n't be defensive .	i 'm not being defensive .
you sound defensive .	i 'm fine .
go ahead . ladies first .	no , why do n't --
c'mon .	wait a second , i --
c'mon , norman .	look , would you --
nice work , norman .	whatever i can do to help .
our answer .	to what ?
this answers one of our questions .	which one ? let me get the list out .
this spacecraft was designed to pick things up . they see things they want -- these claws go out and bring it in . they come across this . this ... < u > sphere < /u > . find it interesting , curious . they draw it inside to take back home .	but on the way home , they miss their turn , go too far , into the past .
i mentioned it in my report . did n't you read the report ?	everything ever written about extra- terrestial life imagines that life is essentially human . if it does n't look human , it 's a reptile or a big insect or something , having human values , human understanding .
and we 're just talking about three- dimensional creatures . what if it 's five or six or seven-dimensional ? so dimensional that we could n't even see it to kill it .	good point . i do n't know what you 're talking about , but good point .
do n't be so optomistic , harry .	i 'm completely serious . there is something very important missing from that spacecraft . you know what that is ?
not a clue .	a sign that the builders knew time travel through a black hole was possible .
i do n't follow you .	on that flight recorder , they called the black hole an `` unknown entry event . '' they did n't know what a black hole was . fifty years from now , men are going to build that ship in a very tentative , experimental way , with no knowledge that time travel through a black hole is possible .
so , < u > we know < /u > . we know it went through a black hole . we saw it . norman -- when we 'd get to the surface , we 'd tell someone about the black hole , would n't we ? it 'd go in some report like some big discovery . so in fifty years when they build that ship , they 'd make precautions for a black hole . < u > but they did n't < /u > . the called it an unknown entry event .	meaning we 're never gon na get the chance to tell anyone .
i ca n't believe that , harry .	gim me another explanation .
i ca n't . if i had a minute to think , maybe , but i know you 're wrong .	am i ?
look -- we 're under a lot of pressure , we 're tired , you 're not thinking straight .	you mean , you think i 'm cracking ?
no . i did n't say that .	then what , norman ?
it 's what 's in that sphere , is n't it , harry ? whatever you think is in that thing -- you think it 's going to kill you .	curious , is n't it ? what 's inside ? before i die , i 'd sure like to open it and see .
what is that ? that noise ?	what noise ?
harry , can you tell me about the sphere ?	what are you still doing here ?
you remember opening the door ?	you were all supposed to leave . you were n't supposed to stay down here .
tell me about the door . do you remember how you opened the door to the sphere ? ... harry ?	you do n't understand about the sphere .
norman ?	what is it , harry ?
what happens on page 87 ? have you ever read page 87 ?	page 87 of what , harry ?
i could never read that far . i never wanted to .	that far in what , harry ?
these are n't half bad , fletcher . you might have a second career coming .	what are they ?
getting anywhere with those ?	there 's some sort of pattern here . it 'll take a minute .
have you looked outside ? jellyfish . everywhere . i hate jellyfish . harry , what happened in the cafeteria ?	do n't do this . do n't psychoanalyze me . i hate squid . period . just like you hate jellyfish .
you said something to me , before -- about how we were all going to die .	did i ?
you do n't remember that ?	i do n't remember much . it 's like my memory is on the tip of my tongue -- but i ca n't taste any of it . funny , my senses are much keener though . purer . hearing , seeing , smelling . like , i can smell your sheets , norman . you tried to wash it out earlier , but i can still smell the urine . do n't worry , i 'm not going to tell the others . it 's normal , really , is n't it ? in a crisis . the stress . the panic .
... you there ? norman ?	harry ?
norman , where are you ?	i ca n't breathe ... am i ... clear ?
thank you . my suit -- beth said she fixed it --	what happened to her ?
what do you mean ? she 's not here ?	when i woke up , nobody was here .
she was supposed to be watching the sensor for me .	her suit 's gone .
beth left ?	i thought she was with you .
she 's cracking , norman .	you did n't say that about the food ?
i was just in the cafeteria , there 's plenty of food in there . take a look for yourself .	but why would she -- ?
wisconsin 's your answer .	wisconsin ?
navy transmission . they 're sent from wisconsin .	how do we decode it ?
we just figured , you know , the three of us -- we need to ... work together through this .	the three of us .
that 's right .	is that why the two of you went through my dufflebag ?
what is it ?	you know what it is , harry .
it 's the squid ! stop it !	stop what ? what are you -- ?
did i kill her ?	i do n't think so .
fine .	help me lift her .
we 're never gon na make it .	shut up and open the door .
how much time you figure to get to the surface ?	two and a half minutes . once we 're in the sub .
i ca n't reach her .	hold on .
push her , c'mon .	i 'm trying . shit . here -- catch her .
missed .	are you trying , damn it ? just --
hold on .	hurry , norman . four minutes .
three fifty-six , three fifty-five , three --	shut up and catch .
c'mon , norman !	i 'm trying to keep balance with --
gim me a second --	just pull her -- down like inside -- harry , work with me here !
her legs are in the way .	you got her ?
get her out of the seat , i need room to sit . harry ?	i 'm trying . there .
you know how to work this thing ?	no idea .
well , press something !	wait !
less than a minute , we 're never gon na make it .	nine hundred feet to surface .
how 's that working out , by the way ?	good . thank you . now that i have it on . why are you laughing ? you do n't even know what that means .
there is one possibility .	we all kill ourselves ? bad joke . sorry , beth .
the power allows us to manifest our fears , right ? what if we feared the power to go away ?	you mean forget ?
what 'd you say to him ?	to who ? arthur ? nothing . nothing that norman does n't already know .
what does norman already know ?	norman thinks we should n't be going down . thinks it 's a mistake .
she told me what you said , norman .	what is it , harry ?
it 's just like swimming , norman ... you know how to swim , do n't you ?	you 're not afraid of the water , are you , norman ?
easy ted , we 're not mining gold .	gim me some room here , will you ? back off . gim me some space .
alot like . you know , i noticed it before , but i did n't ...	shutup , ted . you did n't notice shit . keep hammering .
english ?	that 's right .
you do n't think it does ? i think it 's rather obvious .	is it some sort of joke ? like one of those hoaxes ?
a spacecraft half a mile long -- with 500 tonnes of coral on top of it ? someone went to a lot of trouble . try again .	but it 's impossible .
why would this ship carry instructions in english ?	think about it .
all the facts you need are right in front of you .	gim me a minute here ... i think i 've got it .
do you ?	if it is an alien spacecraft --
an american spacecraft ? half a mile long ? and buried 400 years ? yeah , good theory , harry .	it 's been obvious from the start , has n't it , captain ? that 's why all the secrecy , why no one was told about it ?
we take a weeny little wedge , bang on it a couple of times , and bust off a chunk of the metal . yet any spacecraft -- even at a low velocity , say 200 miles an hour -- crashes into the water -- it 's gon na be like hitting concrete , it would crumple like paper . but there is n't a dent to be seen anywhere . not even a scratch .	meaning ?
meaning it did n't land in the water .	please . it must have flown here --
it did n't fly here . it < u > arrived < /u > here .	arrived ? from where ?
looks like a design , some writing , maybe . maybe it was sent to meet the spacecraft with a message .	look closely . that is n't writing . those are grooves .
hey , go easy on the salt , will ya ? we 're not a bunch of icy streets here .	salt 's good for you , ted . helps you from getting impotent .
well , if it 's a discharge --	it 's not a discharge . right , edmunds ? you said before , right ? so it 's got ta be a message .
if it is a message , it 's probably a substitution code . i 'll work on it .	yeah , i 'll work on it , too .
... i asked myself , why would the sphere be using a code ? if you 're trying to communicate , why use a code ?	see ? no code . what 'd i say ?
what 'd you say ?	`` we are friends '' .
good idea , ted .	thank you .
do n't gim me that psychology bullshit , norman . psychology is n't a science , it 's superstition . it 's a bunch of soft , subjective theories without any hard data to back it up . with an intellect like this , emotions do n't mean shit .	it 's like showing leonardo da vinci a laptop computer . he 'd run screaming `` witchcraft '' . and you could n't explain it to him , either . modems , microchips , particle physics .
norman johnson .	does this mean what i think it means ?
it 's over , sir , the storm has cleared .	the ships ?
how are the others ?	the others , sir ?
beth and harry ?	they 're in the sub , sir . waiting .
that whole time -- i could n't stop thinking of what harry was saying earlier ...	what was that , sir ?
any other bags , dr. johnson ?	just that . careful , it 's heavy .
no other equipment ? scientific instruments ?	no , they did n't say --
captain barnes wants to see you right away , sir .	captain who ?
barnes . he 's very eager to meet you . been calling us every half hour to see if you 're arrived .	really ?
by the way sir , i 've read your report . i think it 's brilliant .	what report ?
you mean they have n't told you yet ?	told me what ?
i 'm in psychology . was . still am really , just been a while . i treat aircrash survivors .	oh , so you 're that dr. johnson .
you 've heard of me ?	well , everybody 's been talking about that report you wrote .
what report ?	huh ?
what report ?	you mean you do n't know ?
must be another johnson then . been flying so many scientists out here -- ca n't keep everyone straight .	who 's everyone ?
physicists , mathematicians , geologists , you name it .	geologists ? at a plane crash ?
strange , is n't it ? in the middle of the ocean no less .	what the hell would a geologist be doing at a plane crash ?
he was n't feeling well .	he 's a pussy .
you want me to try ?	you 're a 53 year old shrink , what are you gon na do ?
strange , is n't it ? you know -- how it would have a button .	earth does n't have a patent on buttons , ted .
he 's manic , norman . you know that ? this reliance on harry is misplaced . you hear me ? totally misplaced . he 's overlooking things . obvious things .	like what ?
it 's not some fucking substitution code , it 's a direct visual representation .	you mean a picture ?
take a look . i rearranged the numbers . put 'em up to the light . go ahead . squint at it .	i do n't see anything .
squint harder .	please , ted .
try this one .	this is like nursery school .
do n't you see it ? it 's a picture of the creature .	the creature ?
well , how about we wait and see what harry comes up with ?	sure , why not . give him the trophy . that pretentious son of a bitch . you heard him , norman . all that `` someone went to a lot of trouble , try again '' bullshit . and `` impotent '' . where does he get off saying i 'm impotent ? he 's a fucking self-righteous , little prick .
well , he 's polite .	unless it 's an act .
you want to put him on your couch , norman . grill him about his childhood ?	when he uses a phrase like `` i am happy '' , i think we should think twice about what we ask him .
frankly , ted , i 'd be much happier if jerry was just a cold , emotionless intellect .	why 's that ?
what was it ?	barnes did n't know . could n't get a reading .
has harry spoken with jerry ?	not that i know of . why ?
you think jerry has something to do with what killed edmunds ? with what 's out there ?	i 'm not sure .
jerry is n't hostile , norman . he said earlier -- we were his friends --	of course he did . he 's been isloated for 400 years . he wants someone to talk to . look , you put a human being in isolation for four days , they can become neurotic , sometimes psychotic . we 're talking about 400 years here . an alien that shows emotional responses . i think we need to address him , before he reacts further .
what kind of a crash was it ?	you seen my suitcase ?
there 's nothing on the news about a crash . did he say what airline ?	he did n't say much at all . honey --
in the closet . i do n't understand , norman -- why would they call you ?	do n't be so supportive , honey .
well , i ca n't imagine five years of unemployment --	four . four years --
four years of unemployment would look too good on a resume .	keep watching the news . are you watching the news ?
there 's a u.s. navy car outside , norman .	what ?
was it a military crash ?	i do n't know .
i 'm han solo , captain of this vessel . who 's in charge then ?	i 'm ben kenobi . luke starkiller here is leading our expedition .
well , we 'll see ...	you might get your stuff together . we 'll be coming up on organa major soon .
the empire must have gotten here first .	the planet has been totally blown away ! it would have taken a thousand ships with a lot more fire power than i 've ever seen ... if the empire had a new weapon that could do this ... i would have heard something ... i 'd know about it .
well , now you know ... the enemy is on the move . we have n't much time .	well , i 've brought you here . what now ?
we have to find he rebels ... what we 're carrying belongs to them .	their bases are very well hidden . all the power of the empire ca n't find them ... do you know where they are ?
no , not anymore .	i 'm not taking you on an impossible search across the galaxy ... i was only paid to get you here and now you 're here . i 'll take my other five thousand and you 're on your own ... i 'll leave you on the nearest system .
well , for one reason , we do n't have your other five thousand .	who 's going to pay me then ?
i think there are some things we should talk about .	i 'm beginning not to like you .
how much do you think she 's talking about ?	a million at least ... if this robot has information related to the destruction of organa major , you 'll be able to name the reward ...
luke 's got a point ... ... fear is their greatest defense ... i doubt if the actual security there is much greater than on aquilae or sullust , and what there is is most likely directed toward large-scale assault .	this is n't a game , you know .
kid , you take the glory and the good intentions and i 'll take the reward .	fear is their greatest weapon .
you have your father 's style . you 've done very well .	not bad .
we 're into the second perimeter . they 'll be coming out to blast us shortly . i was wondering if you had some kind of a plan or are we going to try to blast our way in ?	check your data banks for all the information you have on imperial procedures . both of you will have to learn ...
we 're going to get in by studying imperial procedures ? i do n't like it .	all right then , we 'll use your plan .
i 'll get the information .	... and i want you to start cleaning the equipment out of the scan- shielded compartments .
darth vader is on this system . i can feel him . i can feel the kiber crystal .	is that good or bad ?
do n't look at me . i 'm just a pilot . i got you here ... you 've got to do the rest .	there is a greater risk in staying here , you know . if you do n't find the princess , then the whole trip was for nothing ... was n't it ?
that 's straight through the central core ... up toward the top of the city ... once you 've got her , avoid the main transports , they 'll shut down immediately . your only chance is through the service shafts . there are no sensors there ... all right now , get going , you do n't have time . i hope you can remember everything .	we 'll be back before you are , old man .
good morning !	what do you mean , 'good morning ' ? do you mean that it is a good morning for you , or do you wish me a good morning , although it is obvious i 'm not having one , or do you find that mornings in general are good ?
sorry , but that was the only way to get you down .	could n't we have tried to think of something else first !
i 'm luke starkiller , guardian of the bendu .	oh , so you 're a warrior then ?
who are you anyway ?	you might say i 'm part of the landscape here . they call me ben kenobi .
you 're general kenobi ? ! ? the jedi knight ! the commander of the white legions ?	i 'm afraid it 's been a long time since the white legions roamed the stars . but i have the memories .
i do n't see why . i do n't believe we 've ever met .	i am the son of annikin starkiller .
i know who you are . stand up so that we can talk properly . you 're embarrassing me . i 'm not that important .	but you are ... i know your 'diary of the clone wars ' by heart . my father ...
i ... i 'm not a bendu officer . i 'm not even a startrooper .	i know that .
you saw through me ?	you could put it that way .
i assure you my intentions were n't bad .	i know your intentions . i probably know much more about you than you realize . in many ways you 're a lot like your father . he was an indulgent man , but a clever warrior . now what brings you out here ?
i 'm afraid i 've gotten too old for this sort of thing .	but you must ! i ca n't do it alone . i 'm not at all like my father . i 'd never make it .
i already know you think you 're worthless . i recommend you learn to think of yourself in a better light , for what you believe you are is what you become . i have n't been involved in anything like this for many years .	but the sith lords are involved ! whatever information this r-2 unit is carrying , it must be awfully important . they 're probably looking for him ... i 'm no match for the sith . this is a jedi 's work . this is your responsibility !
you were right . it is my responsibility . the force of others brought the message to you and then it brought you to me .	my father used to talk about the force of others . but he never told me what it was ...
let 's just say the force is something a jedi warrior deals with . it is an energy field in oneself , a power that controls ones acts , yet obeys ones commands . it is nothing , yet it makes marvels appear before your very eyes . all living things generate this force field , even you .	you mean i generate an energy field ?
it surrounds you and radiates from you . a jedi can feel it flowing from him ... ... from here !	could i learn to feel it ?
that is not a human decision , not your or mine .	what do you mean ?
luke , i 'm coming along to do what i can , but i 'm tired and i 'm depending on you to get us through .	but you 're still a powerful jedi . you do n't need my help .
a jedi 's power is measured by the amount of the force that is stored within him , and i have little of the force left in me .	how can you store an energy field within you ?
when a creature dies , the force it generated remains . the force is all around us . it can be collected and transmitted through the use of a kiber crystal . it 's the only way to amplify the power of the force within you .	do n't you have a kiber crystal ?
i had one , but it was taken at the battle of condawn ...	that 's where my father was killed .
yes . it was a black day . one of my disciple 's took the crystal and became a sith lord . it was a black day . the few crystals that remain are in the possession of the sith lords on alderaan . that 's how they 've become so powerful .	do the sith know the ways of the force ?
they use the bogan force .	like bogan weather , or bogan times . i thought that was just a saying .
we do n't have that kind of money . how much do you think i can get for the speeder ?	five , maybe . let me handle it .
this is the last place . should n't we just take what we can get and think of something else ?	he 's bluffing ...
when we get artoo 's message to them , you think they 'll try to rescue the princess ?	i doubt it . it would be foolish for the rebel forces to come out of hiding . i know your feelings . you 'd best forget them . it 's for your own good . there will be no saving her from the prisons of alderaan . it 's the heart of the sith . the bogan force is the most heavy there .
but she 's a member of the twelve families . how can they hold her ?	these are doubtful times . the empire has grown bold in its disregard of the ...
what 's wrong ? what 's happening ?	keep away , i 'm fine , i 'm fine .
are you all right ?	yes ... the force ... something horrible has happened . i could n't see what it was , or where it was , but it was terrible ... terrible beyond description ... the cry of millions dying at once .
are you sure you do n't need it ?	i rarely use it any more . i have the force . the force is more powerful than any pistol . you should n't put too much faith in that weapon . work on becoming aware of the force ... learn to feel its presence within you . try to sense what it 's telling you . it 's the only thing you can rely on .
what do i do ?	all you have to do is lose your thinking self . do n't focus on anything . let your body do your thinking ... you have to learn to act on what you feel , not what you think ... if i had the crystal , it would be much easier . you could feel the force immediately ... but for now , let yourself go . you 'll pick it up ... and someday you 'll have no need for that pistol either .
what is it ?	he ca n't find organa major .
but she is the only link between us and the hidden bases .	you mean we should go after her ! ...
i ca n't see ! how can i fight ?	try to feel it . use the force ...
i ca n't do it . i 'll get hit .	stop thinking , and start feeling . let yourself go .
see , once you let yourself go you can do it . you 'll get it .	i do n't get it , but i guess i did block it .
what about the princess ?	you go after the princess . i am an old man and would be of little help . i must try to find the crystal .
the kiber crystal .	keep it with you always . you 'll have more need of it than i. it will bring the force to you . you 've already learned to feel it ... now you must learn to use it .
of course , where you been kid ?	you look great ! the uniform and everything !
that 's no battle , kid ... they 're just sitting there !	but there was a lot of firing earlier ...
i 'll tell you , luke , and this is between you and me . the star force is n't all it 's cracked up to be . frankly , it 's a bore , and it 's going to stay that way as long as this system is neutral ...	but you always said things were so great at the academy ... what happened ?
the academy is fantastic ... of course , they wo n't teach you anything about flying you do n't already know . most of the instructors are very conservative pilots . you can fly circles around them ... but there is a lot on the scientific side that is down-right amazing , and you get a lot of discipline ... but after you graduate , do n't join the star force -- go free-lance . it 's the only way to get into the action ... i ca n't wait until my hitch is up .	at least you 're doing something ... i 'd give anything to be in your position .
you 're starkiller ?	yes , sir .
have you been checked out ?	yes , sir . i was considered one of the best bush pilots on sullust . i 've also had six hours on the t-2 .
six hours , huh ? well , that 's your ship there . you 're blue five . you stay glued to me . i do n't want any independent operations out there . personally i think it 's foolish for them to be sending fresh kids out on a job like this . this is no joy ride we 're going on .	yes , sir .
blue five , does that glare bother you ?	i 've got it blocked . i 'm all right .
i 'm right behind you , blue leader .	what 's that ?
blue five , break off your cover attack . it 's too late . make your own run on the exhaust port . do you copy , luke ?	yes , sir , but i can get him ...
no reply on any circuits ... it 's drifting on a point twenty-seven skew . it 's not close enough to identify .	alert squad five , but hold them until we know what it is .
should we alert the sith lords ?	i 'll make a report later .
as close as we can make out , it appears to be a corellian gypsy vessel ... it 's not under power .	send one squad up .
we do n't get many visitors . let 's take a look at it .	send out a boarding party . full assault gear .
put that thing away or you 're going to get us all killed .	yes , your highness . i 'll let you open it then . it wo n't be too long before they figure out what happened to us . this has turned into a brilliant escape !
here come six more ... grid two !	was this trip really necessary ?
there are only three or four left .	chewbacca , it 's time we showed them this is n't the regulation f8-88 cargo trawler .
all the data banks in artoo are still secure .	then i think we 're due the reward you offered ... and it had better be substantial after what we 've been through .
when artoo has been safely delivered to my forces , you get your reward . you have my guarantee .	what 's that little 'droid ' carrying that 's so blasted important ?
the plans and specifications to a battle station with enough fire power to destroy an entire system ... our only hope in destroying it is to find its weakness , which we will determine from the data i stored in artoo .	we captured the plans in a raid on the imperial shipyards , but we fell under attack before i could get the data to safety , so i hid it in this artoo unit and sent him off .
where are you taking us now anyway ?	the fourth moon of yavin . i 've given the coordinates to chewbacca .
i do n't see how we 're going to find anything out here . this terrain is hopeless .	did it occur to you they might find us ?
we must hurry to the base . we have little time before the death star arrives .	i 'd like to get paid before that eventually . i do n't plan to stick around for the fireworks .
what about us ? are we to wait forever ? is our reward to be blown to bits on this forsaken system , while your fleet mounts some suicidal attack on that death star ? part of my reward is that i be around to spend it .	i have little time for your mercenary concerns , but i am grateful for the service you have given to our cause . what is your price ?
organa major is a rebel system . there will be quite a few starfleet patrols between here and there ... it could be a little tricky if you want to avoid them ... ten thousand .	that 's pretty steep . we 'd like to talk it over first .
you got yourself a ship . we can leave as soon as you 're ready .	we have a little business to take care of first , but it should n't take long . we 'll be back shortly .
who 's the pilot ?	it 's automatic .
i 'd keep that thing close just in case , if i were you ... i 've been around from one end of the galaxy to the other and believe me this force of others stuff may make for good religion , but there is no substitute for a good weapon at your side .	you do n't believe in the force ?
i found it ... it 's just not there .	what are you saying ?
you ca n't ! we 've come this far . we must find them ...	why ?
maybe you should just drop us off . i 'm sure we can find someone willing to take the risk .	all right , all right ! you 've got a ship ! but where do we go from here ? they probably took her to find the hidden bases ... i do n't see how we can find the rebels before she breaks . the empire has already beat us out .
no , it 's impossible ... no one , and i mean no one would venture anywhere near the alderaan system ... i 'm a free booter , not revolutionary . you 're aboard the wrong ship , son !	maybe the fact that no one would go there voluntarily could help us . they probably do n't think anyone would dare try .
well , i practice a lot ...	you 're good with 'remotes , ' but how are you against something living ?
between his howling and your blasting everything in sight , the entire city is going to know we 're here .	good ! i prefer a straight fight to all this sneaking around .
this is n't going to work .	why did n't you say so before .
something has happened to them . let 's try this way ...	let 's try this way ! holy maker .
i think she 's going to be all right .	not if this tunnel deadends .
is he afraid of the water ?	no , he smells something ... but we have n't time to worry about it now .
watch it ! move back .	get chewbacca . try to get around it . i 'll draw it away .
it 's only light that does n't affect it . solid things , like rocks , can hurt it ! fire above him !	move out of the way !
get to the ship !	come back here ... where are you going ?
i do n't pick up any life form concentration down there . she 'd better be right .	they must be shielded somehow . i 'm sure the base is there .
you 're a good pilot ... i 've learned a lot from you ... i wish you ...	i know , but the chances for survival here just are n't great enough in my book . i 've got what i came for . now i 've got to get back to my ship .
i noticed you were having some problems , blue five ... i thought i 'd help .	thanks , old buddy . i 'll be with you in a second .
a wookiee broke loose up here , but we 've subdued him ... there is a lot of damage , and three , no four , casualties ...	we 'll send a squad up .
no need , everything 's under control .	with four casualties ? !
the ... ah door 's jammed . give us a few minutes to get it fixed .	who is this ? what 's your operating ...
enough ! i already know about the data you 've intercepted , but its ' too late . whatever information you 've gathered will be destroyed ... you will come to know such suffering as only the master of the bogan force can provide ...	you 'll get no information from me . you have no authority ... the council ca n't hold me !
the 'death star ' has become operational . there is no force in the universe that can stop us now .	they 'll find its weakness .
no ! ...	it would be much easier if you were to tell us where the outposts are ... otherwise we 'll be forced to destroy every suspicious system ... what a waste ...
what is it ? what 's going on ? where are we ?	you 're safe . we 've come to get you out of here ... just relax .
i am luke starkiller at your service .	there 'll be time for that later . now let 's get out of here .
are there medical facilities on yavin ?	he 'll be well cared for .
and you ?	i ... i do n't know . i guess i never thought about it ... i just want to help . i want to be in on the attack . i want my own ship .
first thing tomorrow morning you 're going to check those condensing units on the south ridge .	i will , but i 'll have enough time to transmit my application first .
you 'll check the condensing unit first ... and you 're not going to bed until those 'droids ' are completely cleaned up ...	but you promised ! i 've saved enough money and now you have the extra help ... you promised !
i said we 'd see . and as it is , i was forced to borrow your academy savings to buy the new 'droids . ' when you 've saved it up again , i 'll let you go .	you used my savings ! you stole my savings . if my father were here ...
not unless you could get me into the military academy at anchorhead .	i 'm sorry , sir , i 'm only a 'droid , ' and not very knowledgeable of such things ... not on this system anyway . as a matter of fact , i 'm not even sure which system we 're on .
that 's all right . there is nothing anyone can do about it . you can call me luke .	thank you , sir . i 'm see threepio , human cyborg relations , and this is my counterpart , artoo detoo .
there 's a lot of carbon scoring here . it looks like you boys have seen a lot of action ...	indeed , sir , sometimes i 'm amazed we 're in as good shape as we are , what with the rebellion and all ...
you 've been in the counter wars ? ... against the empire ?	that 's how we came to be in your service , if you take my meaning ...
tell me where you 've been . i am going to become a startrooper and fight in the wars . my father was a jedi ! were you in many battles ?	several , i think . there is not much to tell . i 'm not much more than an interpreter , and not very good at telling stories , not at making them interesting anyway ...
according to my father 's tapes , this is the spot where general kenobi lives , but the instruments just do n't match up with the landscape ... there is no doubt about it , we 're lost ...	if you do n't mind my saying so , sir , i do n't see how anyone could live in this forsaken place .
what happened ? i 'm sorry , sir , i must have taken a bad step ...	can you stand ? we 've got to get out of here before those tuskens come back .
i ca n't make it . you go on , master luke . it does n't make sense for you to risk yourself on my account . i 'm done for .	no , you 're not . what kind of talk is that ...
i think we 're going to need them . blast it !	sir , i have a couple of extra circuits . perhaps they might bring something .
let him have it . you 're winning anyway . it does n't make any difference .	i know , sir , but it 's the principle of the thing .
level five , detention block a-23 , cell 2187. she 's still alive ...	send feed-back into the control sensors in that detention block .
see threepio ... do you copy ?	i read you sir .
you 're back . what happened ? never mind . what 's going on ?	i 'm afraid we 're not plugged in at the moment , sir . we 've had some problems .
are you safe ?	for the moment . we 're in the main hangar . artoo is trying to plug into the system now .
wait a minute , slow down ! ... that 's better . they 're where ? they what ? they are ? oh , no ! we 're going to be mashed into conduit before this is over ...	see threepio ! do you copy ?
holy maker , threepio . i forgot ...	are you there , sir ? we 're going ...
thank you , sir . your kindness is greatly appreciated , but if it 's at all possible , artoo and i would like to remain in your service .	i 'd consider it an honor .
you got some guts for a rich kid . i guess you and me could be buddies .	what an honor ...
what makes you think ... you 'll make ... squad leader , rico ?	something ... i 've got ... you do n't .
you rich kids ... are all the same !	it is n't about rich ... it 's about who 's best ... !
wanting it does n't make you the best one for the job .	oh , yeah ? i do n't see anyone else here with the chops to lead .
our love will grow , dear , year by year ...	bye ! write me ! i 'm gon na kill you guys !
funny how they always want to be your friends after they kick your guts out .	it 's what i deserve .
whad'ya talkin about ?	i joined up for her . i would n't even be here if it was n't for her . i 'm a fool .
i say we all go to the laser parlor and get cut together .	what do i want with a scar ?
no , this hurts .	yaaaaaaaa !
mobile infantery rules !	death to all bugs !
lieutenant 's bought the farm . where 's the sarge ... ?	i did n't see him !
dizzy says you two knew this rasczak character in buenos aires ...	he was our teacher ... he was great .
no way . big k taught me i ai n't executive material .	what about it , diz ?
jeez , we musta killed a million already ... !	not enough , i guess .
we got reinforced . most of'em just got outa boot ...	we 're the old men , ace .
we 'll take this high ground . lookouts there and therte and up there . if the bugs come upstairs in this neighbor-hood , we 'll be the first to know .	got it . fleet tactical wants to know where they can deploy the skimmers .
mr. barcalow , save power , do n't waste it on workers ... ace , tell aardvark we 're on our way ...	yes , sir !
saddle up , roughnecks !	you heard the lieutenant ! on the bounce , troopers !
rico , did you give the recruit permission to remove his helmet ?	sir , yes , sir . breckinridge reported a helmet malfunction , and i asked him to show it to me , sir .
are you rated to repair a marauder power suit , rico ?	sir , no , sir .
then why did you order your man to remove his helmet during a live fire exercise ?	sir , i needed everyone in my squad operational , sir ... i ... i wanted to win , sir .
do you freely admit to the charges made against you ?	sir ... i guess i do , sir .
sir , i wish to reconsider my request to drop out , sir .	sorry , son . i ca n't do it . you signed the 1240/a . it would be illegal .
you still have n't kissed her yet ? do n't lie .	what 's the hurry ?
did you read her mind ?	do n't have to ... some mating semaphore is pretty hard to miss .
yeah , but i want carmen .	you got it bad .
do n't think about it ... go on instinct .	ace of spades .
statistically speaking you should 've accidentally guessed right by know .	in addition to `` psychic dolt '' this test also proves i 'm unlucky ? two of hearts .
how do you make him do that ?	i gave him the impression that there was a fly crawling up my mom 's leg . he is going to go eat it .
ten of clubs . you still gon na sign up for starside r & d ?	passport to the universe . who would n't want that ?
i 've been thinking about applying for federal service , too . fleet , maybe .	your father will never let you .
i 'm eighteen . it 's my decision , i think i 'd make a pretty good pilot . i 've good great reflexes . you need that for maneuvering , you know .	only 1 in 14 male applicants make it through stellar navigation . so what do you think your chances are ?
eight point ... no , uh , seven ...	if you ca n't do those numbers , you have n't got a chance .
all i know is carmen 's going to be a citizen , and i do n't think it 'll work out for us if i 'm not .	love ... how excruciatingly pathetic . now try and pay attention .
i do n't believe it !	i got games & theory .
please continue , sergeant .	dizzy would n't want our tears . she 'd want us to remember her ... with a vengeance . so go out and kill a bug for dizzy . kill as many as you can . you are her revenge , and every bug you kill honors her death .
johnny , i 'm sorry it had to be your unit on planet p. that mission had a very low survival probability ...	bugs laid a trap , did n't they ?
you do n't approve . well , too bad . we 're in this for the species , boys and girls . it 's simple numbers , they have more , and everyday i have to make decisions that send hundreds of people like you to their deaths .	did n't they tell you , colonel ? that 's what cap troopres are good for .
hope you 're ready for more . we 're going back to p to capture that brain .	the roughnecks are always ready , sir .
i hear they need a new lieutenant ... want the job ?	i 'll take it ... until i get killed or you find someone better .
you always told me you could n't do human ...	i ca n't ... but like i told you , it 's a number 's game . the federation needs all the pilots it can get ...
are you alright ?	i 'm getting better .
so what are you doing later ?	everyone is going to the dance . are n't you ?
i 'm all ears .	do n't you have to finish the game ?
johnny , this is zander .	yeah , we know each other from the game . no hard feeling , eh , chum ?
hey ! what are you doing here ?	i 'm the guy who 's gon na teach you to fly this crate .
assistant insructor ... you must be some kind of a hot stick . should i call you `` sir '' ?	only when i give you an order .
it 's amazing , us running into each other like this . maybe it 's fate .	maybe not . i heard about this crazy girl coming through the academy , solid math , a little wild on the stick , but a natural . when it turned out it was you , i made sure we 'd run into each other ...
in simulation , my supervisors could never keep up .	this is n't simulation anymore . take'er out easy , cadet .
oh , yes , sir . vector ?	twenty-five by five , roll seven . and do n't exceed port speed .
or ... ?	they revoke our flight status .
thanks . you read my mind . third watch always seems to last forever .	oh , i do n't know ... depends on who you are spending it with .
profile 's wrong ... there .	no , i replotted the course . it 's more efficient this way .
three weeks aboard a starship and you know it all , huh ?	hey , check it .
you know i was talking to captain , deladier , and she said ...	do n't change the subject . am i right ?
well , whad'ya know ...	do n't mess with the boss . so what 'd the captain say ?
she got a command ... and she thinks we oughta team up officially and crew for her . she thinks we 're good together .	you and me , huh ?
i want to be part of the best flight team in the fleet ...	me , too ... day and night-cycle .
where is it ?	there ! gravity field ... it 's big !
everything coposetic , lieutenant ?	zander , you remember johnny ? zander and i are a flight team now .
johnny , wait ...	forget it , carmen . the mobile infantery does a thankless , dirty job , so they naturally tend to be short-tempered , thoughtless and rude .
let 's disregaed rank ... everybody hear that ? rank is not an issue here .	zander , please ... let 's go !
i was thinking . maybe we should get married , carmen .	you were n't thinking ... you were dreaming !
if we 're gon na be a team , why not be a real team ?	there 's a war on . i want a command , i want my own ship , you do , too ...
so ?	so who 's got time to get married ?
fleet encourages marriages among flight officers . you 'd probably get a promotion out of it .	funny ...
i 'm not kidding . marriage is -	no , funny there 's almost no wounded at all .
carmen ... ?	excuse me ... !
i 'm sorry , carmen .	please , i ... everybody 's lost someone by now . this should n't be any different ...
no , i ... oh , zander , i 'm a fool .	you 're upset , that 's alright .
where are you going ?	a funeral .
that girl who died on the way up ... his girl ?	yeah .
how do you feel about him now ?	i do n't know , zander .
i thought i was dead . lucky for me you jokers showed up , eh ?	it was n't luck . rico ignored the mission objective to rescue you ...
zander , what are you doing ?	just giving you something to remember me by , baby .
good for you .	your turn ...
she 's flying starships !	who ?
marco 's sister . can you imagine maneuvering half a million tons through crwoded space lanes ... you got ta have nerves of steel ! reflexes are critical	i have good reflexes .
eeuch !	aw , c'mon , it 's just a bug .
well , if that 's the crop , that must be the gastric caecal ...	excuse me ... !
35 % on the math final ! no one could be that dumb with numbers .	well , at least you did n't lose your lunch over a bug . how embarassing .
who cares about bugs ? you ca n't go anywhere if you do n't know math .	do n't be so sure . i like you even if you are dumb with numbers .
then how come you wo n't hold hands with me at school ?	i do n't want everyone to see .
why wo n't you kiss me when we 're all alone ?	how come that 's all you talk about anymore ?
you ca n't walk me home .	why not ?
i thought you were going to help carl .	carl can wait .
what 's he got against me ... i mean , i 'm a teenager . you ca n't be a citizen when you 're only a teenager !	it 's not you , johnny . your parents are rich they do n't need to be citizens , and that stuff means a lot to my dad . he 's a veteran .
well , if your dad does n't like me , how come we 're such good friends ?	sometimes i do what i want , eh ?
is n't it great to be in love ?	how do i know if this is love ?
romance is just a vestigial biological response to procreation ...	aw , you 're in love with me ... you just dont know it yet .
wait , i want to talk to mr. rasczak .	i 'll meet you outside .
none at all ... we won .	good luck at the academy .
he just got accepted to the fleet academy . is n't that great ?	yeah , sure , i guess .
no , i mean if he can get in , maybe i have a chance .	what are you talking about ? we both know you 're gon na be a pilot .
zander is going for pilot , too .	you two have so much in common .
johnny rico , you 're jealous !	i ca n't help it .
he 's nothing like you .	i do n't even know if you 're my girl .
are you the boy for me ?	i 'm gon na do it , carmen . i 'm gon na sign up for federal service .
everyone 's looking ... we should n't ...	who cares ?
i love you , carmen .	shhh ...
i wonder where carl is . you do n't suppose ... ?	naw , i made it , carl made it .
he was in the group with me . i guess he did n't ...	shhh ! do n't make him feel worse .
hey , carl , what 's wrong ?	did you get starside r & d ?
games & theory ? that 's military intelligence ... oh , carl !	whoa ! way to go , boy-yo !
let 's all make a vow . let 's swear we 'll always be friends no matter what .	i 'll go for that .
you 're late .	my dad had to help me pack . suddenly he 's afraid he 's never gon na see me again or something . it was sweet , but it took forever . anyway , i guess i 'm ready to go .
poor boy . i 'm sorry your parents were so mad .	who cares ! the federation 'll give me everything i need for the next two years , right ?
you talk to carl ?	he left this morning . he could n't say where .
i 'm gon na miss you .	i 'll miss you , too , johnny .
com'on , just say it . try it on for size .	alright , i love you .
do you mean it ?	i said it . is n't that enough ? do n't forget to write !
shhhh ... !	i 'm glad you 're doing so well . if they have n't made you squad leader by now , i 'm sure you will .
what happened to your hair ?	what do you think ? everyone did it when we got our wings . you do n't like it , do you ?
it 's funny . sometimes i forget . then it hits me , and i ca n't stop crying .	i try just to be happy i 'm still alive .
you do n't look very happy to see me .	should i be ?
what 's wrong with you ?	hey , it 's just a vestigal response to procreation ... bitch .
johnny ... ! i thought you were dead !	i 'm not , but alot of my soldiers are . glass the planet !
... i 'm sorry .	we got ta choke on the mud and the blood and fleet ca n't be bothered to spit .
i thought you were kia , johnny ...	that was just a mix up .
you look so ... i do n't know , you look like you 've really been in it .	what happened to your eye ?
almost got knocked out of the sky over big k .	i like it . it 's kinda ... you .
well , look at this . the three of us back together again .	how are you , carl ?
take care , wilya johnny ?	see you on the bounce !
aaaaaaaaaaaaaa !	we 've got ta go get her !
which way ?	up . we got ta be near a company by now .
pilot trainee ibanez reporting for duty , ma'am .	take the number one chair , ibanez . follow all instructions of you supervisor .
alright , take her out , ibanez .	yes , ma'am .
good work , number 1. you 'll do .	thank you , ma'am .
plasma , ma'am ... from the planet .	bug batteries ... according to military intelligence , it 'll be random and light . drop status ?
where 's lieutenant barcalow ?	he requested a combat assignment . there 's always a need for experienced pilots on the ground . i had no choice but to let him go ... he said you 'd understand .
this is rodger young , we 're going down ... repeat , this is rodger young , we 're going down ... !	ibanez ... let 's go !
leave me , lieutenant ! that 's an order !	no way , ma'am !
steady as she goes , number one . prepare for warp . number two , design for jupiter orbit .	yes , ma'am . star drive in three ... two ... one ...
report .	captain , we are in the path of an unidentified object moving at near light speed ...
where 'd it come from ?	trajectory indicates it came out of the arachnid quarantine zone .
this is n't random or light . someone made amistake ... !	that 's it , we 're empty ma'am !
a lot can happen in three minutes .	hut ... hut !
what ?	you were drifting . flip six , three hole . on one , got it ?
hey , rico , wan na dance ?	actually , diz , i promised carmen ...
you still gon na play for brazil ?	looks like , unless tokyo lets me start .
well , anyone who gets you is lucky .	how come we never got together ?
ca n't we just be friends , diz ?	sure .
uh , look , diz ...	guess you got ta go .
hey , amigo , come chow with me .	no thanks , diz .
what 's your malfunction , rico ?	you are . i joined up to get out on my own . and you had to tag along .
what ? you think i joined the mobile infantery because of you ?	you saying you did n't ?
man , they 're defended ... no way in .	flip six , three hole .
what ?	high school ... remember ? run a flip six , three hole play , and you might score ...
cover me .	you got it .
it stinks , you goin .	i do n't stay where i 'm not wanted .
if they did n't want you , they woulda kicked you out , amigo .	hey , they humiliated me in front of everyone ! i 'm just supposed to take it , huh ? well , i 'm not gon na , and i guess that proves i just ca n't cut it .
well , see ya .	you take the stroll down washout lane , you 're only proving one thing , johnny .
what 's that , diz ?	that you do n't have what it takes to be acitizen !
way to go , amigo !	i 'm gon na need a squad leader .
c'mon ...	nah , i do n't do that anymore ...
you used to dance ...	i said no . want me to pull rank ?
hey , diz ...	what ?
planet p ? what kind of name is that ?	they ran out of names a long time ago in this part of the galaxy .
diz , see what you can do .	i 'm on it !
what frequency ?	all bands .
i bought the farm , did n't i , johnny ?	no , you 're gon na be alright , diz !
johnny , people get hurt ... people get killed in the federal service . if something happened to you i do n't know what i would do ...	who gave you this idea ? it 's that teacher . what 's his name ? you know the one i mean .
good good , then it 's all settled .	a year at harvard and you 'll see this `` federal service '' is just menial training for inferior people so they can call themselves `` citizens '' and take airs for the rest of their lives .
why did you go and do that ? he was all ready to go zegema beach !	teenagers !
... cut off !	johnny , why wo n't you change your mind ? does citizenship mean so much to you ?
do n't talk like that . get yourself home as fast as you can .	we 'll all have dinner . i 'll fix your favorite .
oh , my , what 's that ?	looks like rain .
this came for you today . i presume on your request .	a lot of my friends are doing federal service ...
have you lost you lost your mind ? i 'd rather take ten lashes in public square than see you ruin your life .	it 's aterm of service , not a career . i just want to get out on my own and see the galaxy for a couple of years .
mr. rasczak .	rasczak ... silly name . there ought to be a law against using a school as a recruiting station !
no , mr. rasczak does n't do that at all . he sorta discourages you really .	good , because you 're going to harvard , and that 's the end of it .
i 'm eighteen . it 's my decision .	oh , is that how it is ?
a trip to the outer rings . whad'ya think of that ?	wow ! santori and zegema beach , i 've always wanted to go there .
wait a minute ! carl is doing his federal and he is n't inferior . he 's the smartest kid at school !	sorry . carl 's a fine boy ...
you 'll resign , and that 's all there is to it . it might look bad , but if that 's the worst you suffer ...	i wo n't quit !
i 'm telling you , you will ! you 're not going back . you 're going to go on vacation !	i 'm not going on vacation ! i want to be acitizen ! it 's my decision . i made it .
well , it 's just good to hear from you . what 's up , son ?	it 's not really working out for me here , dad . i was thinking ... i was hoping it would be alright if i came home .
we must be right over the colony . let 's get some air support , eh ?	yes , sir ! fleet , this is roughneck patrol , over ... ?
corporal , i want pulse cannons there and there ! rifle teams , spread out along the ridge ! sugar , bring up that flame thrower !	fleet 's pulling the battle group back to safe distance ... they 'd like us to knock out those batteries , sir .
i do n't understand it , lieutenant . it 's not getting anything from 4th brigade ... not even their transponder .	keep trying , sergeant .
gillespie , put in call for retrieval . we 're off this rock . gillespie , do you read me ?	aaaaaaaaaaa !
at 0821 we received a distress call from planet p , priority code , requesting reinforcement ...	i thought 4th brigade cleaned out p .
owen reported the eradication of a low generation colony a month ago . that 's why micom wants onsite assessment .	sounds more like some idiot at military intelligence command wants to get me and my cap troopers killed ...
take your group down to p and have a look see . leave the thinking to us , lieutenant . that 's not your job .	my job is to protect the lives of my soldiers so they can kill bugs , major , and if you 're walking me into a trap-
seeing as how we 're about all that 's left of 1st brigade , you 'd have to call that an improvement . you top kick ?	are you kidding ? they always get killed . you want the job ?
i always wanted to go to zegema beach .	good luck . it 's not there anymore .
you knew the lieutenant before the war ... what was he like ?	he was a teacher , kind of a know it all ... always had this little smile .
geez , i do n't think i 've ever seen him smile .	must fill your bottle up real quick when your wife and kids get smeared .
smith , go ! mcintire , go ! flores , go ! rico , i 'm making you sqaud leader !	sir , thank you , sir !
the marauder power suit will prevent serious injury , but if you are hit , you will be non-operational and your team score will suffer accordingly . rico , has each member of your squad completed a weapons safety check ?	sir , yes , sir !
is that your signature , rico ?	sir , yes it is , sir .
no talking please . i 'm going to ask you some questions . please answer all questions truthfully . we 'll know if you do n't . birthplace ?	here in buenos aires .
are your parents currently citizens ?	no , sir .
which do you think is more important , courage or confidence ?	courage , i guess .
please complete this sentence . i want to be citizen because ...	i want to be a citizen because ... well , because of my girl , sir .
who said you could grow up so fast ? last time i checked you were only five years old . you had such a bright little face ...	aw , do n't get mushy .
wait you two . dad and i have a surprise for you that will settle this . can you guess what it is ?	uh , no .
i do n't know what they teach at harvard , but i think i 'm pretty good enough the way i am !	johnny , please . calm yourself .
well , yeah , sure ...	i hope so . i hope you do n't ruin your life over some silly little girl who wants to look handsome in a uniform .
hello ... oh , johnny ... !	hi , mom .
well , of course you should come home immedietly !	i 've made a mess of things . i 've been so stupid ...
do n't get any ideas . she 's my girl .	you can never be sure .
best in the fleet !	i get it . this is the part that 's best for both of us . do n't do me anymore favors , eh ?
you got something to say about the mobile infantery ?	you heard me . wan na make something out of it , private ?
on whose authority , corporal ?	this would be mine , sir . acting sergeant john rico . i 've assumed command on this mission .
you 're standing on my h.q. , lieutenant !	this is a fleet-driven operation , son , and the fleet thinks my boat will be safer on the high ground . you can have everything else , eh ?
rodger young , prepare to receice outgoing fire ... ! i 'll take the first group .	saddle up , boys , that 's our trash !
what 's your problem now , lieutenant ?	the rodger young just burned up ...
we 're outa here . lieutenant , get your men into the skimmers . this real estate 's about to go buggy .	hey , just calm down , i 'm giving the orders here-
what do you think you 're doing ?	i 'm gon na save carmen .
that would mean a comlete disregard for the mission objective . they hang you for that , rico .	yeah , that 's right .
let 's go .	move out .
can you walk ?	not a problem .
how bad are you , pal ?	been better , buddy .
alright , we 're gon na carry you ...	nah , i figureyou folks oughta get upstairs before it 's too late ... gimmee the nuke .
do n't be a hero ...	this is my farm . now c'mon , give me what you got and get out of here ...
this is rodger young ... what 's going on down there ? we 're taking plasma ! we have orion p-11 as clear !	shut up , sir ! we need pick up now !
what is your position ?	landing zone is extremely hostile . come down on this transmission !
inside 4th brigade compound ? that 's crazy !	then i hope you have a crazy pilot ! keep the line open , dizzy !
you . tell me the moral difference , if any , between the citizen and the civilian ?	the difference lies in the field of civic virtue . a citizen accepts personal responsibility for the safety of the body politic , of which he is a member , defending it , if need be , with his life . the civilian does not .
the exact words of the text . but do you understand it ? do you believe it ?	uh , i do n't know .
mister rasczak ?	what is it , rico ?
i just wanted to say thanks 'cause history and moral philosophy was the best class i had this year .	well , it 's not really my job to please . hope you learned something .
i wan na join up , mr. rasczak . i think i have what it take to be a citizen .	good for you . go find out .
well , my parents are against it , and i know it 's my choice , but i was wondering ... what would you do if you were me ?	figuring things out for yourself is the only freedom anyone really has . use that freedom . make your own choice , rico .
where 'd you learn to do that , soldier ?	uni high tigers , sir . do n't you remember ? i was captain of the team .
all dead except one , sir .	kill the bitch .
yopu asked me some advice once , rico . want some now ?	yes , sir ...
corporal , the roughnecks are moving out for planet p immediately . get yourself squared away and report to gillespie for logistics .	yes , sir !
rico , you 're acting sergeant now . my last sergeant lost the com pack . put together a search team and find the radio shack . we need retrieval .	yes , sir .
what 's that look like to you , rico ?	looks like a bug was in his brain , sir .
warm it all up ! everything you got ! levy , collect the big guns from the towers . watkins , put general owen with the wounded . rico , where 's my communications ?	what 's going on , diz ?
sergeant , secure the boat !	yes , sir !
aaaaaaaaaaaa !	cover us , ace !
hit your jets , sir !	i ca n't my legs are gone ... get on the boat ...
rico , tell'em to glass this goddam planet . i 've never seen so many bugs upstairs at the same time ...	we 're not leaving you here , sir !
this is my farm . get on the boat , now ! that 's an order , sergeant .	give'em hell , sir !
who is ... 'v'ger ' ... ?	v'ger is that which programmed me .
where is lt. ilia ?	that unit no longer functions . i have been given its form to more readily communicate with the carbon-based units infesting enterprise .
why does v'ger travel to the third planet of the solar system directly ahead ?	v'ger travels to the third planet to find the creator .
find the creator ? < u > what < /u > creator ? < u > whose < /u > ... ! ? what does v'ger want of the 'creator ' ... ?	to join with him .
the creator is that which created v'ger .	who is v'ger ?
the examination is a normal function .	you may proceede .
< u > why < /u > ... ? !	the carbon-units infection will now be removed from the creator 's planet .
< u > why < /u > ? !	the creator has not answered .
the carbon-units are not responsible for that .	you infest and control enterprise . v'ger believes carbon-units interfere with the creator in the same manner .
disclose the information .	not until v'ger withdraws the devices orbiting the third planet .
kirk-unit , < u > why < /u > do you not disclose information ?	because v'ger is going to destroy all the carbon units on the third planet .
they have repressed the creator .	the information will not be disclosed .
then v'ger must withdraw its orbiting devices .	v'ger will comply if the carbon units disclose the information .
our data is being prepared .	< u > answer < /u > !
the crews of the previous enterprises were also carbon units . in what way is the life form in your vessel different ?	carbon units are not true life forms ... do those images repre- sent how enterprise has evolved into its present form ?
yes .	carbon units have clearly retarded enterprise 's proper evolvement .
what is enterprise 's proper evolvement ?	enterprise should not require the presence of carbon units .
enterprise would be unable to function < u > without < /u > carbon units .	more data concerning this functioning is necessary before carbon units can be patterned for data storage .
what does that mean ?	when my examination is complete , the carbon units will be reduced to data patterns .
within you are memory patterns of a carbon unit . if i can help you revive these patterns ; you could understand our functions better .	that is logical . you may procede .
does v'ger object to the presence of the two carbon units ?	the carbon units are of no consequence ; v'ger will determine their purpose .
you said v'ger 's purpose was to find and join with the creator .	that is how v'ger will survive .
a machine ... ! then it had to be programmed . by < u > whom < /u > ... ?	by the creator .
to join , and become one with the creator ?	to learn all that is learnable ; to deliver all collected data to the creator on the third planet . that is the programming .
as i stated , v'ger calls to the creator .	v'ger is announcing that it has arrived , sir -- that it 's ready to deliver the information it was programmed to collect ...
'to learn all that is learnable . '	it expects a return signal now , ordering it to transmit that information to the creator .
and when v'ger melds ? what will happen to you ?	it will ... take me from < u > you < /u > ...
departure angle on viewer .	departure angle .
it is a courier , captain . grade one priority . non-belligerency confirmed .	very well , mr. chekov , see to it . viewer off .
deck four , captain ; officers ' quarters ... !	have a security team meet me at deck four main elevator !
sir ! airlock four has been opened ; a thruster suit is reported missing !	spock ... ! get a fix on his position !
mr. chekov , when do those devices activate ?	they reach final position in ... twenty-seven minutes -- mark .
tractor beam strength lessening , captain .	mr. scott ... on my next signal .
i 'm taking over the center seat . i 'm sorry , will .	you are what ... ?
you 'll stay aboard as executive officer ... a temporary grade reduction to commander .	-- you , personally , are assuming command ?
yes .	may i ask why ?
my experience -- five years out there dealing with unknowns like this -- my familiarity with the enterprise , this crew ...	admiral , this is an almost totally new enterprise . you do n't know her a tenth as well as i do .
that 's why you 're staying aboard . i 'm sorry , will .	no , admiral . i do n't think you are ; not one damned bit . i remember when you recommended me for this command . you told me how envious you were , and if only you could find a way to get a starship command again . well , sir , it looks like you found a way .
we 'll have to replace commander sonak . i 'd still like a vulcan there , if possible ...	none available , captain . there 's no one in fact , who 's fully rated on this design .
programming ready ?	program set for standard warp entry , captain ...
... but i still recommend further simulation study .	mister decker ; every minute brings that object nearer earth ! engineering ! stand by for warp drive .
explanation , mr. decker : why was my phaser order countermanded ?	sir , the enterprise redesign increases phaser power by channeling it through the main engines . when they went into anti-matter imbalance , the phasers were automatically cut off .
then you acted properly , of course .	thank you , sir . i 'm sorry i embar- rassed you .
you saved the ship .	i 'm aware of that , sir .
stop competing with me , decker !	permission to speak freely , sir ?
granted .	sir , you have n't logged a single star hour in two and a half years . that , plus your unfamiliarity with the ship 's design -- in my opinion , sir , seriously jeopardizes our mission .
i trust you will ... nursemaid me through these difficulties , mister ?	yes , sir , i 'll do that .
if our executive officer has no objections ... ?	of course not . i 'm aware of mister spock 's qualifications .
recommend defensive posture , captain : screens and shields .	no ... ... that could also be misinter- preted as hostile , mr. decker . cloud composition , mr. spock ?
captain , we 've seen what their weapons can do . should n't we take every possible precaution -- ?	mr decker ... .
i advise caution , captain ; we ca n't withstand another attack .	that thing is twenty hours from earth . we know nothing about it yet .
that 's precisely the point , captain . we do n't know it will do . moving into the cloud -- at this time , is an unwarranted gamble .	how do you define < u > unwarranted < /u > , < u > mister < /u > ? !
< u > computer off < /u > !	it 's taken control of the computer ... !
the ship is under attack ... ! man all defensive stations ... !	forcefields , full remaining strength ... ! total reserve !
why bring us inside ? not to destroy us ; they could have done that outside .	they could have many ways of destroying things , mr. decker .
captain , what 's the next move ?	the question is , mr. decker , < u > is < /u > there a next move ...
well , mr. decker , it seems my bluff is being called .	i 'm afraid our hand is pretty weak , captain . but it 's the only game in town .
, if we do not provide v'ger with certain information , we wo n't have twenty-two < u > seconds < /u > ; the plan must be implemented upon arrival .	captain , we ca n't be sure that our ... move ... will actually save earth .
mr. decker ... i will contact you every five minutes . otherwise ... inform mr. scott immediately .	captain ... i 'd like to go along ...
the fault is here , sir , not in the transmission . the antenna leads have been disconnected . v'ger never intended to accept a transmitted signal .	capture god ! in order to retrieve v'ger 's data , the creator has to physically come here ! ...
and plug the signal directly into the circuitry at this ... ... point here , captain . it should pick up even a tricorder playback .	enterprise , i want that signal again . transmit !
they may have attacked only as a warning to us , captain . to keep away .	that would presuppose a feeling , commander ... compassion . i sensed < u > no < /u > emotion , only ... ... pure logic .
we could have cut it off at the main computer ...	this served the purpose .
captain ... this probe may be a key a key to the aliens .	it 's a programmed < u > mechanism < /u > , mr. spock ...
exactly . and you did have a 'relationship ' with lieutenant ilia , commander .	that probe in there -- in a different form now -- is the same thing that < u > killed < /u > ilia !
then v'ger believes the creator to be a < u > machine < /u > too .	it seems we < u > all < /u > imagine god in our own image .
forward motion , captain ... !	a tractor beam ...
mr. spock , what would v'ger need to fulfill itself ?	v'ger has begun to understand the true limits of our universe , thereby realizing the existence of other dimensions . to fulfill itself it must evolve to a higher dimension ; v'ger believes this can be achieved only by joining with the creator .
that transmitter is a vital link between v'ger and the creator .	we have twenty-one minutes . captain , we can still save v'ger ... and ourselves .
jim ... he < u > wants < /u > it .	you got the enterprise , it 's what < u > you < /u > wanted . this is what i want . but , jim ... ... < u > i 'm < /u > the right choice for this mission .
hello , ilia .	decker ... . !
i now the captain meant no person- al insult .	i would never take advantage of a sexually immature species . you can assure him that 's true , ca n't you ?
negative control from inertial lag will continue 22 point five seconds before forward velocity slows to sub-light speed .	unidentified small object has been pulled into the wormhole with us , captain ! directly ahead ... !
navigational deflectors inoperative ... ! directional control also inoperative , captain ... !	wormhole distortion has over- loaded main power systems ... !
was he difficult ?	no more than i expected not as difficult as this . i 'm sorry ...
that you left ? or that you did n't say 'goodbye ' ?	if i 'd seen you again , would you have been able to say it ?
lieutenant ilia reporting for duty , sir .	welcome aboard , lieutenant .
'commander ' decker ?	our exec and science officer ...
and in you , too , lieutenant .	my oath of celibacy is on record captain . may i assume my duties ?
time to impact ... ?	twelve seconds ... !
five minutes to cloud boundary !	i stand corrected mr. decker . navigator , lay in a conic section flight path into the cloud center ; bring us parallel to whatever we find in there ...
mr. spock ?	impact in fifteen seconds ...
transmit , mr. spock ! now !	ten seconds ... .
thirty seconds to cloud boundary ...	opinion , mister . spock ?
fifteen seconds to cloud boundary .	viewer , standard ahead .
i appreciate the welcome ; i wish the circumstances were less critical . epsilon nine is monitoring the intruder ; keep a channel open to them . where is captain decker ?	he 's in engineering , sir ... he does n't know .
maneuvering thrusters , mister sulu .	maneuvering thrusters , sir .
hold station .	thrusters at station-keeping , sir .
ahead warp one , mr sulu .	accelerating to warp one , sir .
mr. sulu , steady as she goes .	aye , sir .
reduce magnification . factor 4 , mr. sulu .	we 're already two settings below that , sir .
one hundred kilometers ...	hold relative position here ...
viewer ahead .	viewer ahead , sir .
maneuvering thrusters , mr. sulu ; ahead one third . full sensor scan , mr. spock ; they ca n't expect us < u > not < /u > to look them over now !	thrusters ahead , one third .
hold station ... !	thrusters at station keeping ...
clear the bridge , captain ... ?	that was the order , mr. sulu : clear the bridge .
admiral , i 've been hoping to see you . maybe you can get through to those thick heads in starfleet that ...	why are n't the enterprise transporters in operation , mister scott ?
we 're hoping it 's only a temporary problem , admiral ...	see that it is . take me over , please .
admiral , the enterprise has just finished eighteen months redesign- ing and refitting . she needs testing , a shakedown ...	mr. scott , there 's an alien object with unbelievable destructive power less than three days away from this planet ...
the crew has n't had near enough transition time with all the new equipment . and the engines , admiral : they 've yet to be even tested at warp power . add to that , an untried captain ...	two and a half years as chief of starfleet operations may have made me a little stale , mr. scott -- but i would n't exactly consider myself 'untried . '
we 're losing the pattern ... !	starfleet , boost your matter gain ; we need more signal !
reporting as ordered , captain .	sit down , please .
sir , i would appreciate dr. mccoy absenting himself from this interview .	i want him here . sit down !
you 've reported that you felt strong thought emotions . a group of minds from a space vessel ? could you make out any plan , anything to do with earth ?	negative , captain . i could sense only what seemed an almost omniscient pattern of perfect logic . i can explain nothing more ; i understand nothing more .
also -- there was nothing in your report about < u > why < /u > you 're here .	that inquiry invades my personal life , captain .
i still contain fragments of my human half .	and whatever you sensed out here ... .
let it drop , bones . you are my science officer -- i 'll expect an < u > immediate < /u > report on anything further you learn or < u > sense < /u > from here on .	i have accepted service here as a starfleet officer ... sir .
do < u > not < /u > return scan , mr. spock ! it may be misinterpreted as hostility !	intruder scans emanate from the exact cloud center . energy of a type entirely un- known to me .
captain , i suspect there 's an object at the heart of that cloud .	mr. decker , i will not provoke an attack , if that order is n't clear to you ...
they have ... they < u > have < /u > been communicating with us . i sense ... < u > puzzlement < /u > . why have we not replied ?	communicated with us < u > how < /u > ?
it appears that our message has been understood , captain .	any reply from them ?
the 'puzzlement ' i sensed was fleeting ... minor ... ... as if carrying a sense of our insignificance , captain .	our ... 'insignificance ' ?
we are obviously confronted by a highly advanced mentality ... yet they can not understand who we are , or what we want .	but they understood our messages ; they broke off the attack .
recommend we proceede , captain .	mr. decker ... ?
no vessel could generate a powerfield of this magnitude ...	instruments fluctuating , captain . patterns unrecognizable .
that vessel is generating a forcefield measurably greater than the radiation of the earth 's sun .	transmit image of the alien to starfleet ; advise we are attempting further communication .
captain , we have been seized by a tractor beam ... !	get someone up here to take the navigator 's station ... ! engineering ... full emergency power !
we can not break free , captain . we do not have a fraction of the power necessary .	delay that order , scotty ... ! disengage all main drive systems !
have you been able to analyze < u > any < /u > of this ... ?	i believe the light flares to be energy fields -- undoubtedly part of the vessel 's inner mechanism . a technology so incredibly sophisticated that i can not --
they had a pattern to follow ...	... they may have followed it < u > too < /u > precisely .
spock ? concerned about his chances ?	i am uneasy with that being our only hope of more information .
bridge , cancel rescue teams . spock , what in the hell are you doing out here !	i am seeking answers , captain .
it would appear that the atomic arrays of these crystals store information . a remarkably efficient system .	and these 'sensor-swarms ' collect that data , carry it here .
klingons ... our epsilon 9 station ... and ilia ! ! they seem to be more than just images ...	exact patterns . the energy bolt that hit them was n't simply a weapon -- it dematerialized them , stored them . but why ?
if this is their ship 's data banks , where is the crew ? or is their entire ship automated ?	captain , i do not believe there < u > is < /u > a crew -- or that this is a vessel as such .
were you right ? spock ? v'ger is a living machine ... ?	a life form of its own ; a conscious , living entity .
what should you have known ?	no meaning ... no hope ... and , jim , no answers ... ! jim , it 's looking for < u > answers < /u > < u > itself < /u > !
what answers ?	'is this all i am ? is there not more ? '
these read as identical composition ... ... however , captain , they measure several hundred times more powerful !	high mag , mr. sulu !
child ... ! ?	yes , captain , a child : evolving into adulthood -- learning , searching -- instinctively needing .
the orbiting devices would be controlled from the point , then ... ?	precisely .
not for us ?	no , captain , not for us ... for v'ger .
has not , doctor -- and now , because of what we are planning ... will not ...	there is no alternative .
captain , the orbital device will not be triggered for twenty-two minutes ...	the point ...
v'ger plans to literally < u > meld < /u > to reduce both itself and the creator to patterns ...	... and then to reassemble itself < u > combined < /u > with the creator . the most certain way of obtaining all the creator 's answers .
there 's no way to know . v'ger expected it to be a machine -- some single entity . all of us here may be reduced into patterns ...	that seems to be what it has planned -- to have the creator physically present here .
spock , we < u > were < /u > its answer !	yes , captain . it needed our mortality , the fear of it , our struggle against it , our fears , our dreams ...
... and the 'foolish ' emotions which drive us ?	i prefer your poet dante 's phrase -- 'the divine restlessness of the human spirit . '
you 've received your appointment as enterprise science officer ?	based , i am told , on your recommendation , admiral . thank you .
why are n't you on board ?	captain decker requested i complete final science briefing here before ...
here at starfleet ... ? the enterprise is in final preparation to leave dock ...	which will require twenty more hours at minimum , admiral ...
twelve ! i 'm on my way to a meeting with admiral nogura which will not last more than three minutes . report to me on the enterprise in one hour .	to you , sir ?
captain , we need further warp simulation on the flow sensors ...	engineer , we need warp speed now !
warp drive as soon as possible , mr. scott .	captain , it was our anti-matter imbalance that created the wormhole in the first place . it will happen again if we do n't correct it .
that object out there is less than two days from earth , mister scott . we 've got to intercept while it still is out there !	aye , we understand that sir ! we 're doing our best .
engineering ... status , mr. scott ?	we 're ready , sir .
transporters room and chief engineer scott report trans- porter system fully repaired and now functioning normally , sir .	dock signals clear , captain .

why does rachel wear daddy 's underpants ? does n't she have underpants of her own ?	i noticed a whopping pile of laundry sitting on the washer -- perhaps rachel 's underpants are in there -- now where are your lunches ?

queen of diamonds .	seven of clubs . nobody 's mad we just want to talk about it .

ben ! oh my ben ! are you alright ?	i knew where i was all the time .
mommy ? it 's not rachel 's fault i ran away .	no , that 's your fault . it 's her fault for not watching over my precious son , as if it were her priority . which means , the most important job .
rachel 's job is she works .	ben , mommies work too . they work very hard . mommy works harder as a mom than she did when she was working . i just do n't get paid .
does rachel make a lot of money ?	people like rachel who only think about themselves often do make a lot of money .
i think she 's pretty , mommy .	yes ... if you like big hair ...
mommy ?	what honey ?
rache says i have to eat < u > lamb < /u > . i told her < u > you 're < /u > making me < u > spaghetti < /u > !	honey , this is thursday . i pick you up tomorrow , and we do < u > big < /u > spaghetti .
you 'll be up to your armpits in meatballs , i 'm flying them in from sweden .	is that like luigi 's ?
not a lot , sweetie . it 's a country . like canada . only smaller .	where are you , anyway ?
i 'm somewhere , thinking of you . and meatballs . and you know what ?	yes .
of course , you do . being magic . then you know i 've got a flu bug , and i turn green and barf profusely when i even think about food . so , all the more meatballs for you . but you know what .	i did . do i have to eat lamb ? daddy did n't cook it , she did .
that i do . always will .	mom ... ?
i 'm fine , ba ...	tomorrow ? can i have one butterscotch pudding for dessert ?
mommy , if your real name 's jackie and i call you mommy ; and rachel 's real name 's rachel ... then when i see her do i say hi stepmommy ? and if my name 's ben , how come you do n't call me son ?	thursday 's fine ...

mommy 's sick , guys .	you have the worst flu since ...
grammy had a different kind . there are lots of kinds . hers was very bad .	is your bad ?
so you 're okay .	i 'm still sick , but i 'm better .

ben where do you have to get to ?	heaven . i have to tell him he 's made a mistake . he should take grammy martha first . or grandpa norman .
ben . god does n't like visitors .	how do you know ?

so what do you think we 're gon na talk about ?	you dying .
if a soldier loses his legs in a war . is he the same guy ? sure he is .	but you can still see him .

right here . right here . < u > inside < /u > the magician . shhhh .	can i talk to you ? when you 're there .
it 's not good enough .	no , it is n't . because it is n't everything . and we want every- thing , do n't we ?
cooper , back the fill off i do n't have enough shadow ...	you 've got a fruit loop in your hair .
you say that like i do n't know that .	i once threw an entire bowl of jello on my stepmother 's head --
and when did that pass ?	actually , never . they 'll always hate you . there 's a gene for it .

people beat it , do n't they ? all the time .	every day . more and more .
so we 'll ... radiate some more ?	at first . then , after awhile , some chemo .

i have to get dressed . my ex-husband has asked me to dinner . god knows why , he was very mysteri ...	have you still never told him ?
why would his worry ? or my children 's worry . or anyone 's worry . help the sit ...	sooner than later . you really need to .
congratulations . only forty minutes late . you 're handling this promotion really well rachel .	duncan . my work is everything to me . this 'll never happen again . now stand back -- this session 's gon na make you remember why you hired me even though i would n't sleep with you -- cooper let 's get these penguins dancing --
it 's 1:45 , i told you there 's no one to pick up annab ...	but you 're not < u > done < /u > !
i 've got it . it 's in the can , cooper can wrap th ...	we do n't know if you 've got it , we have n't seen it yet ! now go back and finish !
which part of no do n't you understand ?	look , i will < u > send < /u > a p.a . to pick up the children . there are < u > agencies < /u > that supply sitters , nannies ...
you 're making a < u > career < /u > decision here , i would < u > strongly < /u > sugg ...	duncan . i 've got an < u > even < /u > < u > better < /u > idea ...
you ca n't < u > do < /u > that , i wo n't < u > let < /u > you !	no , no , no , this is a job that 's hard to < u > keep < /u > , < u > not < /u > a job that 's hard to < u > lose < /u > , ca n't be both .
planning on getting --	remarried . there is no move .
are you here ?	i 'm here .
because you do n't really seem here .	i 'm here . i 've got a case where they 're this close to sequestering the jury but have i answered the goddamn thing ? !
something 's up wi ...	you think i did n't get that ?
i 've been with someone for quite some time , and did n't feel it was appropriate for her to move in too quickly . but after a lot of thought and careful discussion with her -- and the kids i might add -- she moved in last month .	since our divorce luke has seen a number of different women in three short years and without a lot of warning for the kids , he 's now living with a woman half his age --
rachel 's not half my age .	we 're not discussing your age .
well , we 're not discussing rachel 's age either .	they want to be with you luke , they go to your house to be with their father .
napalm .	except for last thursday when rachel forgot to pick them up --
thank you mrs. franklin . jackie ? this has been very valuable for us . and i 'll have a serious talk with annabelle tonight .	it 's wednesday night . she 's at my house . i 'll talk to her .
i 'll call from work . we can have a conference call .	you tried that last week and we were on hold forty-five minutes ...
you ask me that counselor 's making a mountain out of a molehill ...	i 'm worried .
me too .	luke , i need to switch next friday for thursday , so why do n't you take the weekend ... ... that way you 'll be there , and i 'll pick up monday , tuesday , and wednesday .
fine . but i wanted to take the kids to work with me on wednesday so i 'll take wednesday , and you can pick up that thursday , friday after soccer , and saturday before riding .	easy enough .
just outside the big top , we 're almo ...	you 're where ?
at the big apple circus , it 's the only big top i know . i < u > said < /u > i 'd get 'em back tonight ...	jackie , < u > we < /u > were taking them water- skiing for the < u > whole < /u > weekend !
our children .	do you realize what could have hap- pened to your son today ? how lucky we are the police found him before some lunatic did ? he could have been ...
but he has n't . he wandered off . i know it 's terrifying . i can imagine how you felt when that call came -- but it happens .	not to me .
jackie , you 've made mistakes -- we all make mistakes --	i 'm not gon na wait around to see the next one . i 'm not gon na watch my kids fall through the cracks of this arrangement . i 'm seeing a lawyer .
jackie stop . we promised we never go there .	we 've broken a lot of promises , have n't we luke ?
called him . we set an ap ...	do n't do this .
you 're saying , do n't make the kids a football , do n't put them through a war . but i 'm doing this for < u > their < /u > well-being .	partly . but partly , you 're mad .
you know the kids are n't really in danger . this is about rachel , and you 're right , i 'm disappointed in her learning curve , and ...	< u > slugs < /u > . have faster learning curves . < u > trees < /u > , even .
i 'm afraid she 's going to walk .	and i 'm supposed to care .
still , please .	annabelle showed me the new dress . she 's amazing in it .
i did n't think a phone call was appropriate ...	tell me exactly how you 're different from three years ago ? the music sounds kind of the same from where i 'm sitting .
i grew up , a little . i 'm ready for a life that 's built around commitm ...	just not to me .
it 's going to be hard for the kids when i tell them ... i 'd like you to be there .	to make it easier for them or you ?
it 's a huge moment in their life --	you ca n't be an 'us ' just when you want to . you ca n't play that card when it 's convenient .
we ...	we are over .
you 're still going to have to be dealing with me -- with us . we should tell them together .	no . you think this is going to help the kids then you do it . you 're on your own .
the great thing about life is that things keep changing .	remember when mommy and daddy got divorced ?
she 's a charmer , you 'll see . in fifty years , the kids 'll love her ten percent as much as they love you .	stop . you 're making me insecure .
it 's temporary .	it 's good . you 're not pulling a mid-life crisis on us , are you ?
you want us to take him tonight ? give you some private time with annab ... .	never stand between that kid and a meatball .
yet another spaghetti night .	yeh , better i should forcefeed him burnt lamb and ... couscous , was it she made him ? boy , kids go wild for that .
i know . i would n't know what to say . if it were you .	we 're going to win this .
what happens next ?	i live or i die .
i had a lot of treatments , and they were n't any fun , but the tests show the cancer got smaller .	a lot smaller .
how do you hold down a job ? it 's 8:10. you were supposed to be here at 7:00. she 's missed her sunrise groom'n ride .	this is friday , her riding lesson is on tuesdays . i got it right here ...
every tuesday except the 3rd tuesday of the month when it 's switched to friday except in april when she rides on thursday . it 's not that hard . did n't you have a mother ?	can i please have a cup of coffee ?
we do n't have any coffee .	what is this ? the betty ford center ?
what happened with annabelle ? has nothing i said gotten through to you ?	maybe you could back off just a little bit --
what did you do ?	nothing . look , i want to talk to you about ... well ... luke said to ask you ...
she 's been talking about this little editing machine , it 's only ...	... a ridiculously < u > expensive < /u > and < u > inappropriate < /u > item , which her father and i have already < u > told < /u > her she is < u > far < /u > too young to own . but < u > you < /u > apparently want to < u > buy < /u > her forgiveness , with ...
luke was in the shower this morning and annabelle sort of walked in without knocking .	i 'm sure that did n't upset her . everyone in our family takes showers .
did you or luke talk to her about it afterwards ?	no . i thought it might be uncomfortable for her --
you mean for you . a 10-year-old girl is coping with the fact that her father is never coming back to live with his family . she sees her father naked with another woman for the first time . and you think it 's best for her if every- one pretends it did n't happen ? this is n't going to work out .	you 're damn right . i 'm gon na sick of your imperious bullshit . i never said i was betty fucking crocker . if every time life hits her in the face you want to have a 12 hour talk every third friday or the month -- go ahead ! i have a life !
oh and i do n't because i have a children ? ! the problem is you 're too self-involved to ever be a mother .	maybe the problem is your < u > kids < /u > . maybe they 're spoiled , coddled < u > brats < /u > !
get out !	but it 's not on the schedule !
machines do not eat message .	look , i ...
yeh ?	think twice . before you < u > ever < /u > pull that again .
annabelle does n't really want to talk to you right now .	i 'm sorry i did n't mean to break your concentration . i thought it would be a nice moment to rememb ...
jackie , if i thought for one moment ...	you listen carefully because i am only going to say this once . that woman has nothing more to do with my children .
i am not < u > here < /u > to make it easier for you . these are < u > my < /u > children . they do n't want to < u > be < /u > with you .	well , maybe they would if they thought it was okay , with y ...
... in .	i 'm sorry . look , i 'm not real comfortable being here , but ...
i have a snoop .	i did n't need you to take the blame for me , i 'm quite ...
she already hates me . you 've seen to that .	you 're not terribly good at taking care of h ...
i need practice .	those are < u > my < /u > children you 're practicing on . they deserve < u > first- < /u > rate care . every minute . of every night . and every day .
so why did y ...	i did it for her .
i have an appointment this after- noon . i need someone to take them to the park .	what ? and have federal agents jump out of the bushes with court orders ? how many years do you get in this state for giving second-rate care to minors ?
however many . it 's not enough .	i 'm already on thin ice . yesterday , i actually thought my boss was going to fire me .
bandaids for cuts . bandaids for new shoe blisters . packet of wash n dri 's . kleenex . sugar free lollipops , potty seat covers for public restrooms ...	why not just bring the whole toilet ?
ben likes to be read to . do you know dr. seuss ... ?	not personally .
sorry i 'm late , i got lost dropping ben off at kevin 's .	it 's okay , it 's twenty minutes . the horse 'll be there .
i 'm sorry , i just ...	hey . at least it 's not an editing machine .
what about obsessively picking her split ends ?	anxiety .
last week when she chopped her barbie 's bangs all to hell --	she was angry at herself .
jackie ?	yes ?
you feeling all right ?	not great . plus , i 've got things on my mind . you know .
... thinking of going back to random house . on a part-time basis .	wowie . how wonderful !
... make some trips into the city . sometimes , overnight .	hey , any help you need , we 'll cover .
uh . have you told luke and the ki ...	let 's ... hold up for a bit . it may not happen . our secret , okay ?
i do n't know wh ...	i was looking for annabelle 's book , and i found your tickets . and the note . from your new boss .
my boss .	you 're not working at random house , i talked to them .
you what ?	you 're taking the kids . and moving to san francisco .
look , you 've never liked me ...	do n't flatter yourself .
and i know checking into your life was inexcusable ...	nobody likes a snoop .
bi-coastal parenting . happens every day . luke gets the kids every other summer , every other holiday , it 's not ideal , but people make it work , and ...	we ca n't live like that .
did i hear the word ...	luke . ca n't live like that .
then let him talks to me . we do n't need you to solve our prob ...	... it 's my problem , too .
i got used to ... thinking of them . as ... my kids too .	really . by what right ? six months of part-time screw-ups ?
life 's a trade-off . you get cancer , your hair falls out , but you < u > do < /u > get to smoke dope .	you 're not dying .
you bet you are .	how the hell would you know ?
i do n't , but ...	how would you know < u > anything < /u > ?
and cigarettes . i smoke , too .	you are < u > marrying < /u > the < u > greatest < /u > guy who walks this < u > earth < /u > . who i have < u > loved < /u > from my < u > heart < /u > for twelve < u > years < /u > !
they came out of my < u > body < /u > !	see , i know that .
okay , i 'm undeserving .	ironic , huh ?
small world .	luke 's depo ran late . i promised i 'd take notes .
so i have to tell you something in confidence ...	you 're a cross-dresser .
she has n't mentioned this .	she was afraid you 'd make a big deal out of it .
moi ?	toi . they 've been 'going out ' for two weeks .
as you may know , 'going out ' in the six grade does n't mean shit . they do n't actually < u > go < /u > to a movie or anywhere , they do n't even eat lunch together , it 's just a declaration to the world that they 're ...	... going out , yeh . i had kids of my own , once .
oh , my god .	right . which is the whole < u > point < /u > of this 'going out ' thing , so one of them can dump the other one , and they can imitate the whole passionate adult soap opera tragedy , without ever having to actually date .
she 's devastated .	does n't < u > begin < /u > to describe it . i mean , you 've got cancer , < u > this < /u > is serious .
and you said ... ?	beats me . ask your mom .
can i look at the pictures ?	it 's a mess , right now . that 's my project when i get back .
so . hopeful .	it 's promising , this one . we 're upbeat .
i really look like shit .	you look sick . but you look ... together . mentally tough .
you try to center on the big issues , y'know . what it 's all about . what this whole trip has meant . but then , the < u > really < /u > big issues keep swamping y ...	brad kovitsky .
the primo stuff is great for pain .	i think my 'primo shit ' got left in my 'bellbottoms . '

yah ? well , even the best mom in the world , the smartest , the wisest , whatever . needs to know when to find a plan b. cos plan a < u > is < /u > not and < u > will < /u > n ...	it 's < u > covered < /u > , okay ? i appreciate your concern . can i talk to her ?
hon , maybe your mom would like t ...	... go to the park . in the worst way .
i 'm thinking . do i know you well enough to really chew you out ?	no .
it 's just not the right time t ...	do what you 've worked your whole life to do ?
it was just a job , there 'll be plenty of others .	you mean , after i 'm dead ?
hey , you have n't quit on you , i 'm sure as hell not gon na . i just mean , i 'm juggling a lot right n ...	juggle it ! move the darkroom into your house . you 've got that room downstairs with the treadmill luke never uses anyway . do n't lose your confidence . do n't lose your edge .
it 's the same choice you made .	yes . i made the choice that was right for me . and i do n't regret it . but even for me , there were days when i felt so lost , so invis- ible . and then i 'd hate myself for the kids not being enough .
i know you , huh ? the car pools , he measles , the pta . it 's not gon na be enough for you in the long run . you have to think long term .	i just want to spend time with them when i 'm not rushing or on the phone or tired or ...
my advice to you ? do n't die .	feeling the pressure ?
somehow , his blanket always looked like a cape , even the nurse said that . he < u > loves < /u > to hear that story , over and over . how he was born a magician .	and her ... ?
that thing you said before . pushing the guy sleeping next to you away . because of what you gave up for motherhood ...	is that what he told you ?
you really did n't have to come , you know . i 'd have brought them straight t ...	who in the world < u > is < /u > he ?
looks nice enough to m ...	he looks familiar . did he do a calvin klein ad ?
now we 're going to have a fight , you and i .	are we .
and i 'm going to win .	do n't be too sure .
now , 'limp dick ' , i know . what . is 'snowballing ' ?	it does n't matter , i did n't tell h ...

actually . they 'll want annabelle 's mother .	is that what you 're worried about ? looking bad at the pta ?
you are < u > defending < /u > what you did ?	right down to the ground . let 's get to it .
you put filth in my child 's mouth .	aw .
you had her < u > lie < /u > about that ... that fancy-boy < u > model < /u > !	worked . like a charm .
she was beaten , and bloodied , and it was going to go on , uni ...	so you became the hero . and i became the schmuck .
you taught my child that i am some limp dick < u > loser < /u > . who did n't < u > care < /u > about her pain .	that 's not wh ...
you think < u > i < /u > did n't have some dirty words for that little putz ? you think < u > i < /u > could n't figure out some low blows ?	you were n't passing 'em out .
see , in that crisis , i saw an opportunity . for some < u > real < /u > growth .	oh please .
doing the < u > right < /u > thing . knowing who you < u > are < /u > , inside . not < u > caving < /u > to peer pressure , or < u > lowering < /u > yourself to that level , < u > steering < /u > your < u > own < /u > course ...	she was n't steering her own course , she was steering < u > yours < /u > .
and there will come < u > another < /u > moment . when the stakes are < u > really < /u > there . and she will look back on this . and remember how good it felt . how easy it was .	and she 'll fight back again . god help me , what have i done .
you 've turned her into you . and i may not get another chance . to turn her back .	< u > that 's < /u > what it is . and that 's < u > all < /u > it is .
thanks for coming out .	neutral ground . what 's up ?
she likes a stolie , no ice .	double .
what 's this about ? because we < u > fought < /u > ?	do n't flatter yourself . i always liked that line .
i love luke , i love the children . but there is more to life than even love ...	no , there is n't .
i never wanted to be a mom . then , sharing it with you was one thing . carrying it alone , the rest of my life ...	is scary . but you want it . gim me some truth here .
well , it 's the jack kennedy syndrome , huh ? you die young , you always look golden . perfect . the memory kind of burnishes the image , and ...	come on , a wuss like me ? the stiff who would n't help her own daughter fight back ?
you 're lying .	i lost him . i was panicked .
you are lying , you never lost that kid for 4 < u > seconds < /u > , you could find him from a < u > coma < /u > , there is no way !	i was running around like a chicken with my head chopped off . doing my imitation of you .
ben never mentioned it .	he only remembers i < u > found < /u > him . my point is , telling you this story would have been the kindest , most helpful thing i could ever have done for you .
why did n't i ?	uh . you hate my guts ?
with good reason . they fucking worship you as it is .	what do i have that you do n't ?
everything . you 're ... the earth mother incarnate ...	you 're the hip and fresh .
you ride with annabelle ...	you 'll learn .
you know every story , every wound , every memory , their whole life 's < u > happiness < /u > has been wrapped up in < u > you < /u > , every moment ...	i have their past .
now edna says you short-changed your last meds . you can do presents and be comfortable at the same time , y'know .	just want to be a little sharper . for a few minutes .

i just found out i have to go to boston to get a deposition . i might not be back until saturday .	so i 'll have to order in ?
we have the kids this weekend , so ...	jesus .
anyway , i thought ... while i 'm gone ... maybe i 'll hire in some help .	for what ?
just a babysitter -- i mean ... you 're working ...	i can take them to work with me -- i can shift things around --
you do n't need to . i do n't expect you to handle them yourself .	ca n't handle them myself is what you mean . ca n't .
you do n't trust me to be alone with them .	i trust you of course i do but --
but ? but what ?	but you 're not good at this . not yet . i 'm sorry .
look . i know they hate me .	they do n't hate you --
and what you 're telling them is keep hating her -- keep up the good work --	nobody 's telling them to hate you --
really ? look in your ex-wife 's eyes .	it 's complicated for jackie . it 's complicated for me ... you do n't have kids -- you do n't understand --
oh right ... so it 's just complicated for you and jackie -- for me it 's pretty simple cause i just do n't understand ...	no you do n't . and i 'm not gon na screw with my kids heads right now --

everything 's gon na work out . the kids and i ... we 're going to love each other .	rache , it may take time .
well , i think you should tell him you changed your mi ...	it 's no biggie .
it 's just an assignment .	it 's anna sui , you should be doing it .
they 're my kids .	great , wallow in guilt , you < u > sure < /u > you 're not jewish ?
she 's not gon na die .	i know that .
no problem .	i made that paella you liked . it 's on the stove .
what a great surpri ...	hold your applause . we 're not having fun , here .
just like to make sure . that your past . and my future . are real different .	well , they will be .
why in the world would she t ...	you took a fishing trip with the boys . liked it so much , you took another .
i needed some time away .	... while she watched the kids . then , you booked this flat in paris for your family 's summer . but she said ...
she called it a fight . < u > the < /u > fight .	what do you call it ? you told her you had doubts .
can we go sit somewhere ?	let me put it this way . hell , no .
i told her i loved her .	by way of saying you were unhappy .
restless .	excuse me . 'things are so confusing for me , jack . our life feels too comfortable , too safe , too predict- able . it 's a partnership , it 's juggling schedules . when i think of playing that out , every day , for the rest of my life ... '
' ... i do n't know if i can make it . ' that 's what i said . but i did n't leave .	no , she threw you out . what a difficult woman .
that 's a pretty ugly thing you just said .	no , here 's ugly . 'i love < u > you < /u > , babe . it 's just our < u > life < /u > together i 'm not so sure about ... '
'but keep dancing , and if you 're lucky , i might just never leave , who knows ? '	that 's not us .
we make our lives , one step at a time . we do the best we can . the truth about the future ? a promise . is only a hope .	how about the promises we make to our kids ? about < u > their < /u > future . do we shrug those off , just that easily ?
where you goin ' ?	i 'm gon na get me a drink .
hi , i 'm here to pick up ben .	does jackie know this ?
no . i 'm doing it behind her back .	in seven years jackie 's never missed one of tucker 's parties . where is she ?
something came up . c'mon ben ! i 've got a shoot at three ...	tucker has n't penned ben 's present yet -- it wo n't be too much longer .
i do n't know what 's wrong with that kid .	maybe he 's gay .
do n't ever say that .	what if he is ?
out ! leave the table !	what ?
you heard me : leave the table !	man , i am out of here ! this family is so fucked !
we 're studying the holocaust in social studies .	oh , yeah ?
well , i 'm supposed to watch schindler 's list for homework . the movie 's like almost four hours . and then i 'm supposed to write a report on survivors . you know any survivors , dad ?	hmmm ... do i know any ... personally ... ?
hey .	hey . what 's up ?
there 's something i need to talk about with you .	what ?
there are some rumors ...	like what ?
you know ... stanley ...	oh .
no prob . i 'm cool .	thanks , scoob .
marty , ignore him .	he 's vegetarian , does n't do sports ...
well , technically your zeda is a survivor .	he was in a concentration camp ?
well , no . but he had to escape the nazis .	but i thought he came over to america before the war .
well , he did . with his family . but his cousins , they had to stay and they were all killed . and if he 'd stayed , he would have been killed . so in my book he 's a survivor .	even though it was only his cousins that were killed ?
hey , scooby ! how 's it going ?	conan o'brien ? whoa ! what are you doing here ?
i 'm looking for a last-minute guest for my show . any suggestions ?	i 'll be your guest !
welcome to the show , scooby .	thank you .
nice to have you here .	great to be here .
and thank you for dressing up for us . this is very classy . tell us . what kind of professional plans do you have ? what 's in your future ?	well , i was thinking ... i might work for you .
ahh ... tell me . what do you want to do for me ? what 's your idea ?	be your sidekick , you know , and maybe eventually become a tv talk- show host .
consuelo ?	yes , mikey ?
do you have any brothers or sisters ?	yes .
really ? how many ?	four brothers and five sisters .
wow . why did your parents have so many children ? i mean , if they were poor , would n't it be better to have just one or two ?	it was god 's will .
but do you really believe in god ? and heaven , hell and angels and all kind of stuff ?	no .
when i 'm in high school i 'm not going to play any football . i 'm just going to concentrate on class rank . what did you do in high school ?	i did not go to high school .
were n't there high schools in el salvador ?	we had to work . my family was poor .
must 've been hard being poor .	i 'm still poor .
hmmm . but , consuelo , even though your poor , do n't you have any hobbies or interests or anything ?	no , mikey .
but like , what do you like to do when you 're not working ?	i 'm always working .
but when you 're not . like now . what do you like to do ?	this is work .
consuelo . are you crying ?	no .
yes , you are . i can tell . what 's the matter ?	mi jesusmi jesus
speak english .	mi jesus esta muerto !
consuelo , i 'm sorry , but you know if you do n't speak english i ca n't understand you .	my jesus
who is jesus ?	my baby .
you have a bay ?	my grandchild-baby .
gee , i did n't even know you had any children . but why are you so upset about jesus ?	he 's dead .
oh . how did it happen ?	he was executed . he was on death row and then he was executed .
how did they execute him ?	poison gas .
maybe it 's for the besti mean , if he was guilty of doing something wrongpeople who are bad should be killed . do n't you think so ?	jesus was not bad .
maybe he was and you just did n't know it .	he was n't .
but still , you ca n't be sure .	i am sure .
but really , you never know .	i know !
why was he on death row ?	for rape and murder .
consuelo , what is rape exactly ?	it is when you love someone , and they do n't love you . and then you do something about it .
sometimes i feel like my parents do n't love me .	well then , when you get older you can do something about it .
so whaddya think ?	well , i 'm not really sure what you 're trying to say . it 's funny , i suppose . but it seems glib and facile to just make fun of how idiotic these people are .
i 'm not making fun . i 'm showing it as it really is .	you 're showing how superior you are to your subject . toby no , but i like my subject . i like these people .
no , you do n't .	yes , i do . i love them !
the camerawork 's nice .	thanks . i 'll tell mike . well , it 's still just a beginning . i know i can ... dig deeper .
this is definitely better .	you think so ? you do n't think that this might not be a little dry ?
this is entertainment you 're making , toby . this story about a kid in the suburbs and the state of the college admissions process has , with this brady crisis , evolved into something much richer and more provocative .	yes , i knowbut still , it should be somewhat entertaining .
i mean , without this footage , without this rigorous documentation , it would feel like exploitation .	no , no , no . no exploitation . this is seriousbut do n't you find it a little funny too , at the same time ?
you 've got a family tragedy on your hands . will you tell me what 's funny about that ? about a kid in a coma ?	nothing , i guess
i mean , why are you making this documentary if you ca n't treat your subject with appropriate gravity ?	ok , you 're right , you 're right you know , we need to screen what we 've gotinvite some regular people , just some random off-the- street typesand see what real people think of this .
i dunno , toby . we really have a long way to go . you still need a lot more footage , and it 's probably a little premature to start screening	ok , then we can invite serious intellectual types .
we 're not ready .	hip alternative types who will understand the process better
we 're not ready !	well , i need to see this with an audience !
what 's an audience going to tell you ?	i do n't know . maybe they 'll like it .
do n't even joke about that !	i 'm serious ! what happens if he blows up the school ?
twinkeys !	boys , take napkins ... napkins ...
mom ?	yes , mikey ?
i was looking through scooby 's sats practice books this afternoon and i took one of the practice tests . guess what score i got ?	what ?
steak 's really good tonight . scooby good .	got a lot of homework ?
marty ...	you started filling out your college applications yet ?
not to be crass , but what do we get out of this ?	do n't worry , he does n't mean money .
we used pull .	you know , you have to . sometimes you just have to , toby .
it 's all about who you know .	look , we 're not suckers . everyone else is out there doing the same thing .
sure ! ...	of course , honey . come in bed with us . come on .
was anyone in my room today ?	is everything ok ?
what are you going to do ?	i dunno .
we did the same thing last year also .	how was the class ?
well ... yes . if it had n't been for hitler , he would n't have had to leave europe . we would have been ... european .	but then , in a sense , since you would never have met dad if your family had stayed in europe ... if it were n't for hitler , none of us would have been born .
hi , scooby ! how was school today ?	fine .
ready for tomorrow ?	what 's tomorrow ?
hey , you want to hear my short story now ?	huh ?
i can read it to you .	you mean , again ?
well , i changed the ending a little .	oh . what happens now ?
well , actually , it 's the same , but longer . i think it 's better . more ... raw .	well then , maybe you should just read the ending .
but it wo n't make any sense if you hear it out of context .	i think you should leave it the way it was . it was good .
so you do n't want to hear my new ending ?	you 'll read it in class tomorrow . surprise me . anyway , i have to go . i promised melinda i 'd help her with her oral .
you 're tired of me . i can tell .	marcus , i 'm tired . that 's all .
you 've lost interest ... you hardly even sweat any more when we have sex .	i was never much of a sweater . you know that .
what do you want ?	do n't be so upset . it 's ok ...
what the fuck are you talking about ? what 's ok ?	you know he hated my story also .
marcus ... you 'll write something better next time !	patronizing fuck ! if you had just been honest with me in the first place i would n't have read it . i knew it was shit . but - idiot ! - i believed you !
that 's not fair ! i was honest ! just because i was n't sucking up like that bitch catherine .	well , i sure did n't hear you voice your opinion in there when it mattered .
which is it ? you got ta keep your focus straight .	you 're absolutely right . the focus is on the college admissions process today .
and you want scooby to be the focus of all this ?	scooby and a few other students of different socioeconomic backgrounds .
reconceive .	'cause scooby does have a quality that i 've been looking for , a quality that is emblematic of american today . it 's part disillusionment , part hope ...
oh , i know , i know that . well , sharing your story , your ups and downs , and so forth , can i hope , be an illuminating experience .	yeah ... how do we know we wo n't be exploited ?
but what kind of pull did you have ?	i have a cousin . very big giver to the alumni fund .
i think scooby 's like a lot of kids . he just hit aa speed bump . now he 's gon na find his way , his path is gon na be cleared , and i think he 's gon na continue his education at a good college . and everybody else is gon na be happy .	... but mr livingston , are n't you a bit fearful that scooby will be confronted with hollow values and systemic conformism ?
fuck !	i 'm going in there .
i dunno .	whaddya mean you do n't know ? you either got a lot or you do n't . what 's not to know ?
what do you know ?	dad , i 'm trying to figure things out right now , ok ? it 's like , really hard , and i 'm just listening to some old elton john and ...
so ? how was school today ?	the same .
the same . same as what ?	just the same .
get the hell outta here !	man , it 's just , like , conversation .
scooby ?	yeah ?
whaddya wan na talk about ?	do n't screw around with me . you know what i 'm talking about . you 're taking those sats . you 're taking those sats or your cd collection is history . you 're taking those sats and you 're going to college . you 're taking those sats if i have to strap your ass to a chair , but buddy your taking them .
ok .	tired of this shit ...
i just want to know what the hell he 's doing in his room that 's so interesting he does n't come down for dinner .	maybe he 's building a bomb ... just like- !
mom , it 's not fair if brady can say the f-word and i ca n't .	yeah , well , mikey , listen up . cause here 's a lesson : life 's not fair .
dad ? do you think that brady will ever get better ?	one in a million recover .
maybe he 's that one in a million !	mikey , there 's optimism , and then there 's stupidity . it 's a very fine line .
i do n't think there 's any hope , either . i was just trying to make you feel better .	thanks .
you 're welcome . dad ? would you let me try hypnotizing you now ?	yeah . sure go ahead . hypnotize me .
hey , mikey . you wan na get some ice cream ?	ok !
hey , mikey !	hi , dad !
come here , give me a hug !	gee , you 're home early !
yeah , uh , listen . why do n't you go upstairs and keep your mom and brady company for a bit ? i need to speak alone with consuelo for a moment .	sure , dad .
hello , vi .	what are you doing here ?
i 'm sorry . i did n't mean , i just did n't expect to run into you here , that 's all .	well , now you have .
yeah , um , then ... are you alone ?	uh huh .
you 're not .	good . 'cause i ... um ... i really agreed with everything you had to say last week about how bad my story was ...
that 's good .	and i also agreed with what you said today about marcus 's story . it is a piece of shit .
you have beautiful skin .	thank you . so catherine seems like she might become a really good writer .
are n't you going out with catherine ? i 'm sorry . it 's none of my business . i did n't mean ...	i 'm not 'going out ' with catherine .
oh . do you think i have a potential as a writer ?	no .
it 's over there .	thanks .
it 's a really nice place you have . is the rent high ?	take off your top .
oh , bu ... uh ... i ca n't say that .	say , ni ...
ni ...	... gger .
... gger .	say , 'nigger . '
nigger .	'fuck me hard ! '
fuck me hard !	say , 'nigger , fuck me hard ! '
nigger , fuck me hard !	again !
nigger , fuck me hard ! ! ...	again ! !
no , not really .	any books you like to read for fun ?
no .	none at all ? how about those 'underground ' comics ?
i hate reading .	all right , scooby , let 's not beat around the bush . with your attitude , you 're not going to get in anywhere .
ok .	'ok . ' so you just do n't care . let me ask you , not as your guidance counselor , but ... as a friend : what do you want to do with your life ? i mean , what kind of long-term goals can you possibly have ?
i dunno ...	c'mon . talk to me . tell me what you 're thinking .
well , i mean ... i wan na be on tv . maybe have a talk show or something . like conan . or early letterman .	ah-hah . and how is it you hope to achieve this goal ?
hello ?	hello , is this pam ?
who is this ?	toby oxman .
toby - ? oh , hi ! how are you ?	oh , fine . how are you ?
great !	great !
so what 's going on ?	that 's what i was gon na ask you .
but ... you called .	oh , yeah , well ... um ... i was just calling because , well , i was wondering if you still remembered me , which i guess you do ...
so . look at where we are : the year 2000 ! can you believe it ? i mean , did you ever think we would actually make it ?	um , well , yeah . so are you still acting ?
oh , no , not any more . no , um , i kind of came to terms with myself , i realized i had done what i had to do . and it was time to move on .	oh . so what did you do after you gave up on acting ?
i believe it .	yeah , well , it was really all kind of a joke - and a rip-off , so , uh ... so i dropped out .
oh , that 's too bad .	yeah , well , then it got me writing , so that was a good thing .
anything i might know about ?	well , um , i kind of let things go on this novel i 'd been really into - i mean , the whole publishing industry is totally corrupt . i mean , really , it 's finished .
that 's too bad .	i worked over at a homeless shelter for a while , drove a cab to pay the rent , but , i mean , that was like - i mean , i have some dignity .
that 's good . so then what do you do now ?	i 'm a documentary filmmaker .
oh ? anything i might have seen ?	n-not yet . i 'm hoping to get a grant for this one project on teenagers . geez , remember when we were teenagers ?
yeah . you did n't wan na take me to the prom .	oh , i do n't remember that ...
i do .	well , but it was so long ago . we were so different back then ...
uh , well , anyway , so i 'm looking for subjects for this documentary on teenage life in suburbia . kind of an exploration of the mental psyche of its mythology . i wrote to derrida to see if he 'd like to do the narration . but everything 's still kind of in development at this point .	hunh .
that 's good .	yeah ... um ... so anyway , tell me . what about you ? i 'd heard through the grapevine you were producing movies .
yeah . but not any more .	oh . tired of 'life in the fast lane ' ?
yeah ... so you 're um ... you 're married ?	yeah .
huh . kids ?	yeah .
how many ?	three .
great . how old are they ?	eight , six , and four .
listen , toby , i ca n't really talk right now . do you mind if i call you back ?	yeah , sure .
ok. bye .	maybe she has caller id .
pretty cool , stanley .	thanks .
how 'd you get it ?	it 's my dad 's he hides it under some old tv guides in his closet .
gee , your dad 's smart .	i know .
is it loaded ?	no , i do n't think so ...
scooby , do n't ! be careful !	i 'm not an idiot , man . i watch tv .
i know . i 'm sorry . i 'm just ... a little nervous , i do n't know why .	you should be .
scooby ?	yeah ?
you know ... i like you .	yeah . i know .
you want some ?	no , thanks .
you a pervert ?	no ... actually , i 'm a documentary filmmaker ?
oh . you mean , like , blair witch project ?	well , no . i 'm doing one on high school students , in fact .
what for ?	well ... it 's kind of a sociological study in the aftermath of columbine .
is this to like get into sundance ?	yeah , well , it 's possible they would be interested in it .
doubt it .	actually , there is some interest from the sundance channel .
whoopee .	hbo and mtv have also shown some interest .
so like , yeahi caved in . i mean , i had to . my parents , they 're like still really depressed about brady . so i wrote the bullshit essay . filled out the applications , did the interviewsy'know , i figure i can always drop out .	so where 'd you get in ?
prnceton .	but what did you get on your sats ?
hey , um , toby ? i was wonderingis the documentary almost finished ?	uh , yeah , we 're getting there .
can i see what you have so far ?	sureumyeah , as soon as i have a screening i 'll let you know .
what is most important to you ?	i dunno . i 'd like to be good at something . it does n't have to be tv . i mean , it could be movies ... anything . i 'd be willing to direct .
uh , scooby , now i understand how you want to be a tv talk-show host and all , like conan o'brien , but did you know even he went to college ?	he did ?
yeah . he went to harward .	oh .
oh , my god , scooby ! i 'm so sorry ... i 'm so , so sorry ...	do n't be . your movie 's a hit .
henry , what exactly are these crazed gunmen demanding ?	th-they want t-twenty-f-five million dollars cash -- or chemco will be destroyed .
twenty-five-million ! and what will they do if the money is n't delivered ?	th-th-they 'll kill one hostage every hour until it is --
does that include helen filmore , united states congresswoman ?	y-yes --
uh-oh ! do you know if the demands are being taken seriously at this point , or does washington think these people are just a bunch of crazy fuckers playing games ?	well , i-i hope that -- that --
i do n't know what hit us ! we had them trapped on the stairwell . they could be anywhere now .	i now understand the expression `` you get what you pay for ! '' a bunch of chumps !
we got trouble . that bodyguard son- of-a-bitch has them running all over the field -- just took out three on the north end !	well get someone down there !
is he with the girl ?	i do n't know -- look ! they can get in now , man ! we got no one left to guard it !
i 'll lead .	why ? are we going dancing ?
i said i 'll lead .	what are you going to do , cooper , throw yourself on a bunsen burner ? it 's a bunch of businessmen touring a lab . we 'll be out in no time .
i got ta keep you alive -- it 's in my contract .	if you 're working for me you 're going to do what i tell you .
just get me a coke and do n't argue with me , ok ?	i 'm not arguing . i 'm just telling you what the deal is -- congresswoman .
anything else ? maybe a sandwich ?	just the soda , please . cooper heads down the hall . filmore watches him leave , sighs , then turns and smiles at the general manager :
what are we going to do !	who 's got matches ?
what now ?	we 're outta here --
-- be prepared .	we do n't have time !
let 's move it we got company !	what happened !
forget about it .	i was n't angry with you i was angry with him .
he 's a very stubborn man sometimes ...	you should listen your old man more often . he 's got principles .
what do you mean ?	after leizburg , he stuck his neck out to defend me . he 's loyal to the end . even if it 's not -- politically correct at the time .
what 's that supposed to mean ?	what do you think ?
let me tell you something cooper ! i never once bad-mouthed him during all those months --	no but you did n't defend him either ! did n't want to rock the boat . guess the ride was too smooth . filmore i was acting under legal counsel !
cooper ...	yeah ? ...
i drew my gun , ran in the direction of the cries ... violating the first rule of service ... i let the ambass- ador out of my sight .	what happened ?
you 're a lot like my father , cooper ... you think with your heart .	used to filmore , used to .
now what ?	there 's the fence ...
i 'm going first . taking the fire . if we go out together we 're all dead !	what are you talking about ?
they probably have guards on the roof -- and they 're gon na be firing at me -- not you ! atkins what makes you so sure ?	because i 'll be firing at them .
what about rule one : never let the person you are protecting out of your sight !	rule two : without alternative , use yourself as a shield .
well filmore --	well cooper ...
looks like you 're not going to make that dinner after all ...	i guess not cooper ...
i have a lighter !	even better .
how well do you know this place ?	we 're on sublevel six . we 'll pass some labs and then we 'll hit the stairwell --
are the labs in operation ?	i do n't see why they would n't be .
how 's the arm ?	it 's nothing to worry about .
that 's it ! up ahead !	where does it lead ?
enjoying the tour so far ?	are you going to kill us ?
go fuck yourself ...	hey now ! no cussing on tv ! well in closing i 'd like to say that there are two reasons to have that money outside in an hour . one is my perky co-anchor here , and the second is the lives of tens of thousands of people -- people just like you and me !
i hope you do n't mind all this -- it 's just that the networks will eat it up , you know ...	you 're going to pay for this ...
you understand that they 're watching our every move right now -- you think you 're just going to sail away ?	it seems to me we are just sailing away . they have n't sunk us yet , have they ? besides , do n't you worry your pretty little head about that . it 's all been taken care of .
i know you 're not too happy at this point . it 's too bad we were n't able to meet elsewhere , under different circumstances ...	like where -- in your dreams ?
i suppose ... you think i should thank you .	yes , you should .
you see , it paid off -- you broke away from the old guard , congresswoman . it wo n't be long till they 're calling you senator filmore --	shut up !
come on , drink up .	i do n't want any ...
i insist ...	i said i do n't want any , goddammit !
came over the satellite . we 're keeping the bird clear should they call back .	she 's still alive .
well ?	we 've prohibited the networks from broadcasting the transmissions .
good .	we have a special forces squadron out of thailand surrounding the compound as we speak .
why the hell did n't you tell us this was at stake !	chemco 's been developing nerve gas ?
what about cooper -- where is he ?	he 's in there ...
looks like richter is n't acting alone -- he 's heading into some dangerous waters .	she 's as good as gone ...
this was taken when richter was arrested in washington state , 1985. he was charged with interstate arms trafficking , skipped bail , and has since been a fugitive .	chemco is willing to deal with him , meet his demands . i can have the money there in an hour .
and -- of course there is the human cost , which is incalculable .	i 'm sure you 'll figure it out .
who 's ryan cooper ?	i 'll let the senator tell you .
and what exactly do they intend to do ?	the ball is in richter 's court . but we 're sure as hell not going to sit on our hands while he assassinates people -- we 're gon na stop the son-of- a-bitch !
so , what are we looking at white ?	what do you mean ?
what do they have in there that 's so valuable ? a cure for aids , a cure for cancer ?	i assure you gentlemen if we had something of that magnitude it would n't be shelved in a lab somewhere ...
is there anything in there that can blow ? we have to be ready for any contingency --	mister myers it is a chemical plant ! there are a number of volatile compounds -- but they are safely stored away ...
chemco makes many things senator ! we were under government contract !	i have n't been briefed on any such thing !
apparently , this project is -- unique . but it 's heavily protected -- all formulas are heavily codified !	what the hell is it , anyhow ?
well , it 's a binary formula -- a precise amount of two separate chemicals must be exposed to the nitrogen in the atmosphere simultaneously for it to work .	how much do they have ?
he would n't take it on the helicopters . he 'd transport it through pipelines that connect chemco to the waterfront ...	what !
how goes the roll call ?	we 're secured . takeover team is in position and accounted for .
have you broken it yet ? we 've got six more heads and that means six more hours .	i 'm in to the directory but they 've codified the stockpile -- numerically .
of course it 's codified ! each number probably corresponds to a compound . have them pull every compound from the lab and compare it to the codes till you figure it out -- that 's what you 're here for .	i know what i 'm here for-you do n't need to remind me .
something tells me you do n't want to be on tv , friend .	richter-we got a problem !
kz ... 7-0 ... 7-0 ... nine . it checks out .	excellent ... excellent !
where the hell could they have gone !	what are you so worked up about jack ? fuck 'em -- we do n't need 'em .
i want the girl . i do n't care about the rest -- but a us congresswoman taken hostage will make for great copy . we 'll make headlines all over the world ...	you 're fucking crazy richter -- you know that ?
what 's happening at the waterfront ?	we 're almost done piping in directly to the olympia . should have it all in about an hour or so .
our traveler 's insurance , you know what i mean ?	gotcha . we 've been filling barrels all day -- we 've got hell of a stockpile .
good .	i say we head out .
agreed -- let 's move it .	are you hungry ? we can discuss some final arrangements over some slop in the galley .
my crew is going to work alongside with your men , do n't worry -- we 're a team !	why should i worry ? is there a problem ?
well , there was uh , a little dissent about the amount of the bonus --	dissent ?
are we adrift --	if i do n't get power up we are !
drop the anchor !	we ca n't -- it 's power driven !
get your men to do it !	the thing weighs more than a ton -- you want to roll up your sleeves and try it ? !
just what the hell is he talking about ?	we 've ... been developing a product ... kz 70709 .
of the separate chemicals -- i do n't know , uh , offhand --	how much of this shit do they have , white ! !
they must have got their hands on a test vial !	what does that mean ?
please be calm , ambassador de sade .	you will not get away with this vicious attack on our peace-loving people .
war-mongering bully ! do n't think you 're going to intimidate me !	all right , mister ambassador ! but you must treat general `` buck '' schmuck with the respect due him .
can i have a glass of water ?	certainly - how about some breakfast ?
possibly some coffee ?	moffo !
thank you , admiral .	now , mister ambassador . in a very few moments we should have premier belch on the phone . i intend to tell him exactly what has happened . i merely want you to authenticate certain facts for him .
the food - you would n't put - anything in it , would you ?	do n't be ridiculous .
i have your word , mister president ?	yes , of course .
where are you trying to reach him ?	at his office in the capitol .
if he 's not there , try ... 87 - 43 - 56 .	did you get that , kulnick ?
what 's the meaning of this ?	i am sorry . sub-miniature photography is my hobby . it 's amazing what excellent en- largements you can make from the negative .
well , it has been explained to me that , if you add a thick cobalt-thorium-g jacket to a nuclear device , the radio- activity resulting from such a nuclear explosion will retain its lethal power for a hundred years .	our scientists calculated that the detonation of fifty of our biggest nuclear devices , jacketed in cobalt-thorium-g would enshroud the earth in a hundred years of lethal radio- activity from which no human life could escape . in ten months the earth would be as dead as the moon .
where is this ... thing ?	it is buried somewhere in the grudd mountains .
mister ambassador , what on earth possessed your country to build this weapon ?	first of all , economic reasons . it was cheap . the entire project cost just a fraction of what we spent in a single year on our various space and missile programs . it also seemed ideal in most other respects . it was terrifying , convincing , automatic , and extremely simple to understand .
but , finally , one factor tipped the scales . we received information from a very re- liable source that your country was going to build one .	that 's preposterous ! we have no such program !
the source was ... shall we say , completely reliable .	the report is entirely untrue . i can assure you of that .
yes ?	allow me to assure you that my government will not be satisfied with a polite note of regret for this shocking example of aggression against our peace-loving people .
damn you , de sade ! you know as well as i do that this was the act of a mentally sick man - a single individual , whose crack-up can probably be traced to the strains and tensions caused by your country .	it is very convenient to place all the blame on a dead man .
this dreadful accident could never have happened if your government had n't cynically and hypocritic- ally blocked every proposal we made for disarmament or arms control ! !	bah ! all you wanted to do was spy in our country !
that 's nonsense , and you know it !	i know nothing of the sort !
surely , you do n't expect us to destroy our weapons without being able to verify that you are doing the same ?	and surely you do n't expect us to let you spy in our country before you destroy your weapons .
and now , mister president , i must return at once to my embassy to communicate this reassuring news to the premier .	goodbye , mister ambassador .
excuse me , mister president , but you forgot to give me my camera back .	oh , yes , that 's right .
premier belch will not be fooled by this fantastic lie .	mister president , are you going to let this stooge talk to you like this ?
do n't you dare touch me ! what the devil do you think you 're doing ?	i caught you red-handed , mister ambassador .
give that back to me .	what do you think of this , mister president ? i told you we should n't let him in here .
do you mean to say you 'd set it off in your own country ?	naturally . it would kill us just as surely even if we set it off in your country . but this way we know it 's safe , and we do n't have the problem of delivering it .
mister president , i ca n't buy this malarkey ; they would n't set the damn thing off . why should they ?	you 're absolutely right . we would n't . no sane nation ever would . that 's why it was designed to trigger itself automatically .
then all you have to do is untrigger it .	ah , but if we were able to untrigger it , that would be defeating its purpose . all our enemies would have to do , would be to warn us in advance that they were going to violate one of our unalterable triggering conditions . we would bluff , naturally , but in the end we would be insane not to untrigger it . now we can say : there is no point trying to intimidate us , we do n't control the doomsday machine .
perhaps you gentlemen would like to check with the source ?	you mean you 'll tell us his name ? ? ?
please , mister president , i am extremely shy and do not wish to endure this sort of personal humiliation . here is the only other camera i have left .	see ! see , i told you .
my seven body orifices ? ? ? ?	that 's right , fella .
major ? ... major ? i 'm colonel `` bat '' guano , 701 battalion .	come in ... come in ... peace on earth ... peace on earth ... yes ...
why are you saying that phrase over and over again ?	i think that just might be it ! although it could be riki-tiki-tavi .
what are you talking about , major ?	the three-letter code group . or maybe some combination of the three letters . p ... o ... e , or p ... e ... o , or e ... o ... p ... let 's see , there would be six possible combinations .
get a grip on yourself , major !	it might still be worth trying riki-tiki- tavi . r ... t ... t ... there 's only three combinations of -- t ... t ... r , or t ... r ... t ...
now , snap out of it , fella !	who the hell do you think you are , sir ? ? ?
i did that for your own good , fella . now i 'm not going to pull rank on you . when this is over , i 'll be happy to step outside with you and settle this thing . right now my orders are to locate general ripper and put him on the phone with the president .	well , you ca n't do that because he 's dead .
do you have any witnesses , major ?	what ?
what happened , major ? some kind of private beef between the two of you ?	look , i did n't shoot him !
we 'll have to leave that up to the c.i.d . boys , wo n't we , major ?	look , colonel . i 've got to talk to somebody at air command .
do n't worry , major . your rights will be fully protected .	colonel , do n't you know what 's going on ?
sure i do . there was some kind of mutiny on the base , and you killed general ripper .	look , general ripper went off his rocker and ordered the 843rd bomb wing to attack with h-bombs .
you must think i 'm an awful sap , major . just sit down , fella , and keep your hands on the desk !	did n't they tell you ?
they told me , major . and i did n't hear anything about any atomic attack .	look , colonel . you keep me covered , but let me just pick up this red telephone that connects to air command headquarters . okay ? ... i wo n't play any tricks on you ... okay ?
okay , fella . but just move slow and do n't do anything that might surprise me .	sure ... sure , colonel . now look , i 'm picking up the phone ... nice and slow . right ? ... hello ? ... hello ? hello ? ... hello ? ... gee , it must be edad . probably the lines were hit during the fighting .
now look , i 'm picking up this ordinary telephone . see ? ... hello ? ... hello ? ... nuts , the lines must still be disconnected . the general had us disconnect ...	look , colonel . maybe it 's too late . maybe they 've sent air command in already . but we 've got to try to con- tact somebody .
on your feet , fella . i 've got to get outside and see how my men are .	okay , colonel . but look , there 's a pay phone just outside in the hall . maybe that works , huh ? maybe it 'll work ? what do you think ?
you 've wasted enough of my time , fella .	wait a minute . the president ! ! that 's it ! the president ! ! !
what about the president ?	he wanted to talk to general ripper , did n't he ?
so what ?	well , i 'm general ripper 's executive officer . he 'll want to talk to me .
operator ... how much would the call be station-to-station ? ... thirty-five cents cheaper ? ... i 'd still be short twenty cents ... just a second , operator ... colonel , shoot the lock off the coke machine . there 's bound to be enough change in there .	that 's government property , major .
i 'm sorry , sir . general schmuck is asleep and he is n't taking calls until eight-thirty .	what is your name , young lady ?
ceida pietraszkiewicz .	what did you say ?
ceida pietraszkiewicz ... p ... i ... e ... t ... r ... a ... s ... z ... k ... i ... e ... w ... i ... c ... z .	now look here , miss pietraszkiewicz , this is air command headquarters calling .
yes !	general schmuck ?
go back to sleep , baby .	what did you say , sir ?
i did n't say anything . what 's the meaning of disturbing me at this hour , colonel ?	general schmuck , we monitored a trans- mission about six minutes ago from burpelson air force base , hq 843rd wing . it was apparently directed to their wing on air- borne alert . it decoded as - wing attack , plan-r .
colonel , you 're not drunk , are you , man ?	no , sir .
well , that 's ridiculous . if the teleprinter and radio links are out of order , just pick up a phone and pay for a call .	i know it sounds crazy , sir , but we tried , and nobody answers any of the telephones .
does the threat board show anything ?	well , that 's the funny part of it , too , sir . it does n't show a damned thing .
well , mister president .	what kind of trouble ?
general schmuck ?	yes , sir . he issued attack orders to --
may i be stupid enough to inquire why in hell the base commander of the 843d bomb wing did a thing like that ? ? ?	to be perfectly honest , mister president , we really are n't sure .
you are n't sure !	not exactly , sir . you see , colonel puntrich at air command hq received a call from him about twenty minutes ago . he asked general ripper if he had issued the go-code and the attack order , and general ripper said : `` sure , the orders came from me . they 're on their way in , and i advise you to get the rest of air command in after them . my boys will give you the best kind of start , and you sure as hell wo n't stop them now . '' then he hung up .
damn it ! damn it ! i 've been telling you all for years you 've got too damned many psychoes in the service .	be fair , mister president . did n't we initiate the human reliability tests for all personnel handling nuclear weapons ?
just a second , sir . he 's got films of the war room in that thing !	i 'm afraid i 'll have to ask you to take the film out .
yes , sir . one thing , mister president .	yes ?
under a condition red alert , the base will probably be sealed off and defended by the base security troops .	i am aware of what a condition red alert implies .
well , sir , they may not allow the special service troops to enter the base .	that 's a very wise deduction , general .
under the circumstances , general , what would you think they should do ?	well ... i suppose penetrate the base by force .
you see , you knew the answer all the time , general .	but that would mean some of our own boys will get hurt , mister president .
what do you suppose is going to happen if general ripper 's planes start bombing their targets ?	that certainly would be a problem , sir .
i did n't speak to him , sir . but colonel `` bat '' guano was in command of the special service battalion , so i would imagine he did .	i want him upped to brigadier general , and recomended for the d.s.c .
combat operations center , major mandrake speaking .	this is general ripper speaking .
yes , sir .	do you recognize my voice ?
why do you think i ask ?	i do n't know , sir . we just spoke a few minutes ago .
youddo n't think i 'd ask if you recognized my voice unless it was important , do you , major ?	no , sir .
good . has the wing confirmed holding at x-points ?	yes , sir .
all right , major . i 'm putting the base on condition red .	condition red !
that 's right . i want this flashed to all section immediately .	yes , sir . what 's up , general ripper ?
you 're a good officer , major mandrake . you have a right to know . it looks like we 're in a shooting war !	a shooting war !
yes , major . this looks like it 's going to be it .	but ... what kind of a shooting war ? have they hit any of our cities yet ?
major , that 's all i 've been told . just got it on the red phone . the base is to be sealed tight . and i mean tight .	yes , sir .
let me worry about that , major . i 've still got my red line to the air command .	that 's right , sir .
we do n't want to be vulnerable to saboteurs calling up and pretending to be different people from the president down , do we ?	you 're right , sir .
no calls from inside out . no calls from outside in are even answered . no calls .	i understand , sir . nothing comes or goes without your personal say-so .
no calls at all . with or without my say-so . my voice can be imitated too , major .	yes , sir . i just thought of something , sir . how do i know i 'm talking to you now ?
who do you think you 're talking to ?	to you , sir . but how do i know ?
are you trying to be insubordinate ?	no , sir .
i hope not . now , as soon as you do what i told you , have plan-r radioed to the wing .	plan-r ? ? ? ?
are you hard of hearing , major ?	no , sir . plan-r to be radioed to the wing .
as soon as you 've done that , shut down the communications center . lock it up and assign the personnel to base security details .	general ripper , if i shut down the communi- cations center , there 'll be no radio or teleprinter contact with air command head- quarters or anyone , for that matter .
are you questioning my orders , major ?	no , sir . i 'm just bringing the facts to your attention , sir .
you 're a good officer , major , and you 're perfectly right to bring these facts to my attention .	thank you , sir .
now , as soon as you 've done that , double- up on all base security teams . our enemies are plenty smart , and there might even be an attack on the base by saboteurs .	yes , sir .
what 's the gun for , general ripper ?	please do n't take any notice of this weapon , major . i love all weapons , and as of late , i 've just taken to keeping a loaded weapon nearby at all times .
sort of like a new hobby , huh , general ?	that 's right , major .
i see you 're playing your radio , major . is n't that contrary to my instructions for the personnel of this base ?	oh , it 's not my radio , sir . i picked it up in the communications center .
i did n't mean for anyone to play anyone else 's radio either , major .	yes , sir . general , can i ask a question ?
certainly , major mandrake . you 're a good officer , and you can ask me a question any time you want to .	well , general ripper , sir -- i was thinking -- we 're on a condition red , are n't we ?
that is correct , major .	and a condition red means enemy attack in progress , does n't it ?
you know the regulations well , major .	well , sir , i was thinking , if an enemy attack is in progress , how come the radio 's still playing music ? it 's supposed to go off , and all we should hear are civil defense broadcasts .
that 's a good question , major . maybe if you think hard , you can think of the answer yourself .	well , i was thinking , maybe an enemy attack is not in progress ?
but then , sir , why have you issued the order : wing attack , plan-r ?	because i thought it proper , major . why else would you think i 'd do it ?
suppose that were the case ?	but -- why ... that would be an awful thing to do , sir .
do n't fret about it , major . there 's nothing anyone can do about it now . i 'm the only one who knows the three-letter code group for the crm-114 .	i know that , sir .
i suppose they are , sir .	you 're damned right they are .
how much soda , sir .	just a squirt .
that about right ?	perfect . thank you , major . and now let 's drink a toast .
what shall we drink to , sir ?	to peace on earth .
general ripper , can i ask another question ?	ask away , major .
well , general -- i was wondering , why are you doing this ? i mean why do you want to start the war ?	i 've given it alot of thought , major . do n't think i have n't .
no , sir . i mean i did n't think you had n't given it a lot of thought .	do you remember what clemenceau once said about war ?
i do n't think so , sir .	he said war was too important a matter to be left to generals .
i see .	when he said it , fifty years ago , he might have been right . but today , war is too important to be left to the politicians . do you follow me , major ?
i 'm trying to , sir .	you see , major , at this very moment , while we sit and chat , a decision is being made by the president in the war room . he knows that the enemy will pick up our planes on their radar in about twenty minutes .
but when they do , sir , wo n't they hit back with everything they 've got ?	if we have n't taken any further action , they certainly will . doyyourhappen to remember the statistics on our casualties in the event of a full-scale enemy attack ?
well , i think i remember reading the report on that . was n't it something like a hundred and sixty million ?	that 's close enough , major .
but then why do you want to kill a hundred and sixty million of our people , sir ?	you 're being dense , major . i certainly do n't
i suppose we might catch them off their guard .	our missiles would impact before my planes were even discovered by the enemy , would n't they ?
i guess so .	i know so , major . i know so . and add to that , the whole air command force being committed to clobber everything they 've got .
but even then , we would n't get everything . i mean some missiles would abort , or they 'd miss their targets , or maybe the enemy have some secret bases we do n't know about .	you 're absolutely right . you forgot to mention their nuclear subs . but it would n't matter . sure we would n't get off without getting our hair mussed , but we 'd prevail . i do n't think we 'd lose more than fifty million people , tops .
but if you just let things alone , we would n't lose anyone .	major mandrake , i guess you do n't follow what 's going on too closely , do you ?
where , sir ?	where ? everywhere , major . everywhere .
well , i know they 've been going on for years , and they have n't gotten any place .	not yet , major . not yet .
and i guess they wo n't until they agree to let us inspect inside their country .	you 're very naive , major . do n't they say they want disarmament ?
yes , sir . but so do we .	but we mean it because we are a peace- loving country . are they a peace-loving country , major .
i do n't know , sir . but they 're just as anxious to avoid a nuclear war as we are . war just does n't make sense any more , for anybody .	but war does n't make sense precisely because the weapons can kill an entire country -- right ?
right .	then do n't you realize the bomb gives us peace not war ? and , if that 's the case , i ask you again : why do they want disarmament ?
go on , major .	i was just going to say , as long as the weapons exist , sooner or later something 's going to happen -- and that 'll be it for both countries .
i 've heard the arguments . like napoleon 's quote , `` there 's one thing you ca n't do with a bayonet , and that 's - sit on it . ''	that 's right , sir . and do n't forget in a few years a lot of other countries will have the bomb . what if they start something ?
go on , major . you fascinate me .	well , sir , i remember an example that pointed out that if a system was safe on 99.99 % of the days of the year , given average luck it would fail in thirty years .
i still ask , why do they want disarmament ?	well , for the same reasons we do , sir . do n't you see ?
no , major , i do n't . they have no regard for human life . they would n't care if they lost their whole country as long as they won .	gee , sir , that last remark does n't exactly make all the sense in the world .
major , you 're talking like one of them !	well , i 'm not , sir . honestly , sir .
do n't be offended , major . our president holds the same views .	do n't you think he knows something about this , general ripper ?
i 'll tell you what i do think . if they say they 're for disarmament , i say anyone who says they 're for disarmament is either a traitor or a damned fool .	but , general , we 're on our toes . we have n't agreed to anything for years . inffact , a a lot of people say we never will .
but if they suddenly opened up and gave us the inspection we want , we 'd agree , would n't we ?	if they gave us what we think we need , yes , i guess we would .
and you 'd like to see that ?	general , what 's good enough for the president and all the experts he 's got working on the thing , is good enough for me .
do you think we 'd cheat ?	no , sir . i 'm sure we would n't .
do you think they would cheat ?	look , sir . i 'm no expert on the subject , but i 've read some pretty sharp ideas the big boys have . like , say , both countries agreeing to a million dollar reward and international protection for anyone who gives evidence of cheating to the inspectors . you ca n't hide those things without a lot of people knowing about it . and if i were going to try and hide a few , i would n't want to depend on the fact that some poor slob is n't going to run and blab for a million bucks . we 're as smart as they are , and if they cheat , or even hold back information , we 'd pull right out .
major , those are my boys out there dying .	yes , sir . why do n't you stop the fighting , sir ?
to peace on earth , major .	peace on earth .
general , now that you 've done that , i beg you to recall the wing .	major , i happen to believe in a life after this one , so i believe i will have to answer for what i have done . i think i can .
it was a honest mistake , sir .	i presume the planes are armed ?
i 'm afraid so , mister presient . being part of the air-borne alert , each plane is carrying a full load - about fifty megatons apiece .	well , what about the positive control , the safety catch ? do n't the planes automatically come back unless they get a second order ?
that 's right , sir . but the planes were at their positive control points , ready to turn around when general ripper issued the final go-code .	and i suppose there 's some reason why you have n't recalled them ?
yes , sir . the base commander , general ripper , selected plan-r ?	what the hell is plan-r ?
well , sir , plan-r is an emergency plan to be used by lower echelon commanders if higher echelons have been knocked out by a sneak attack .	why ca n't you cancel it ?
once the orders have been given , plan-r requires any new orders to be received on the crm-114 in the aircraft . but the crm-114 will not receive any transmissions unless they are preceded by the proper three-letter code group .	and i suppose you 're going to tell me you do n't know what the three-letter code is .
how soon until the enemy finds out what 's going on ?	we estimate the planes should be entering their coastal radar cover in about twenty-five min- utes .
how could you let this happen , general schmuck ?	mister president , i know you think i 've let you down , but we had to have a plan-r. if we completely centralized the command and control , all a potential aggressor would have to worry about was knock- ing out maybe half a dozen headquarters and the capitol , and we 'd be out of business . we 'd have planes and missiles just sitting there while we were getting clobbered .
then there 's no chance for recall ?	i should say practically none , though we have our communications center plowing through every possible three-letter combination . the trouble is that there are about seventeen thousand permutations , and it will take us approximately four and a half days to go through them all .
general jack d. ripper , sir .	i want to talk to general ripper .
i do n't think that 's a fair analogy , sir .	admiral buldike ?
but he 'll hear everything we 're saying . and if he just looks out of that window , he 'll see everything we 're doing .	that 's the idea , general schmuck . zlat !
we do n't operate like you kgb boys .	knock it off will you , general ? crudley , find out what 's holding up that call !
have you received acknowledgements from every plane ?	they 're coming in now .
how long will it take to receive them all ?	i 'm not certain , mister president . the boys in concom do the pencil work .
i believe it will be just a few minutes , at the most .	how many planes did we lose ?
i 'm not certain , mister president . but i believe it was four .	general faceman , what was the name of the officer who called me from burpelson ?
general schmuck , are you positive of your figures ?	naturally i am , sir .
he says they 've only shot down three planes .	well , if you choose to take his word over mine -- -
look , he 's there , and you 're here .	mister president , there were thirty-four aircraft involved . thirty acknowledged the recall . that makes four shot down .
how do you know they were shot down , buck ?	well , just common sense , sir . thirty from thirty-four equals four , or my name 's not `` buck '' schmuck !
yes ?	well , sir , it looks like one aircraft , the `` leper colony '' , failed to receive the recall .
have you tried the recall again ?	yes , sir . we 're still sending it . but it 's a funny thing we do n't seem to be able to make any contact with the aircraft at all .
what 's the target .	well , the premier doped it out pretty well . its primary is their missile base at laputa .
is there any chance a single aircraft can penetrate the entire enemy air defense , when its course and target are known ?	if i can speak freely , sir -- look , these guys talk big , but frankly , we think they 're short of know-how . you ca n't just take a bunch of ignorant peasants and expect them to understand a machine like one of our boys , and i do n't mean that as an insult , mister ambassador . hell , we all know what kind of guts your people have . why just look how many millions of 'em those nazis killed and , hell , they still would n't quit .
general , stick to the point , please .	well , sir , if the a/c 's a really good man , i mean really sharp , why he can barrel that plane along so low - well you just have to see it some time . a real big plane , like a sting ray , zig-zagging in , its jet exhaust frying chickens in the barnyard -- - has he a chance ? ... ..hell , yes ! he has one hell of a chance .
you 've lied to me twice - i 'm sorry , but it will be strictly routine . these men are experts .	zlat , make sure the secret service boys care- fully search his seven body orifices .
yeah , to see if we 're on our toes .	no , they would n't send us in with bombs on an exercise .
give me a first rough course as soon as you can , lieutenant ballmuff .	roughly , one-zero-five . i 'll have it plotted in a minute , major kong .
i 've got the heading , major . one-three-eight .	roger . one-three-eight .
roger , maintain .	lothar , take your checks now .
we should be crossing the coast in about six minutes .	thanks , binky . can you see bromdingna island yet ?
all right ... we 're still flying . i 'm taking her down to the deck .	give me revs for maximum speed at sea level .
you know what that 'll do to our fuel consumption .	ca n't help it . what 's the wind like ?
what else could it be ?	maybe it 's an exercise .
he 's right . we would n't have started it .	they must have clobbered some of our cities already !
he 's right . they must have clobbered some of our cities already .	the dirty , stinking , rotten , sons of b 's ! ! they might have clobbered marge and the
maximum ecm .	fifteen ! twelve o ' clock .
then this is it .	what ?
war .	war ?
i 'm sorry , major kong . i guess i was way out of line .	forget it , quentin . it can happen to the best of us . now let 's get squared away .
a through h is correct .	main interference linked to electronic detector . fight interference on readi- ness state .
check .	missile and plane flight path computer showing four greens .
check .	zombies set to knock out local air defense four hundred miles from primary .
missiles ! sixty miles off , heading in fast . steady track , they look like beam riders .	roger , keep calling them . knock off auto-pilot , ace .
just the missiles .	they must have been fired from bromdingna - probably one of their new vampire - 202 's . they 've got a range well over a hundred miles .
forty-five . still coming straight and fast . twelve o ' clock .	speed ?
between mach 3 and 4 .	call them every five miles .
twenty ! twelve o ' clock .	maximum ecm !
should n't be bad . might even help . but my guess is we 're going to have to paddle our way back .	we 'll worry about that later . okay , i 'll take damage reports .
yeah , i got it in the thigh .	lieutenant toejam , why do n't you help him ?
why ca n't he help me now ? he 's sitting two feet away from me !	come on , quentin , is n't that pretty selfish , putting yourself ahead of the mission ?
look , i 'm shot - it hurts .	lieutenant quiffer , we 're all sorry you were hit , and we 'll help you stick it together as soon as we get squared away .
roger .	fighters closing fast - range fifty miles .
they must have made a visual contact .	must be mach two-five stuff . altitude fifteen thousand .
they ca n't touch us at this height .	they 're moving apart .
if they come down low enough to make a firing pass , they 'll never be able to pull up in time .	i think they mean business .
sorry , king . my leg 's stiff as a board .	hey , terry , i 'm hit .
well , listen , king . could you take her up to about eight hundred ? that 'll help you come in at a nice down-angle , and it 'll give us a chance for our chutes to open .	sure , i 'll take her up to eight hundred .
could you take her up right now , king ? other- wise we 'll get kind of close to the fireball .	sure , i 'll take her up right now .
hey , king . somebody at burpelson has a very perverted sense of humor .	yeah ?
wing attack , plan-r. that 's exactly what it says .	check your code again . no one at base would pull a stunt like that , terry .
no , this looks like the real thing .	yeah , it sure looks like the real thing , all right .
okay . check these points . complete radio silence . to ensure that the enemy ca n't plant false transmissions and fake orders , the crm-114 is to be switched into all receiver circuits . the three code letters of the period are to be set on the alphabet dials of the crm-114 , which will in turn block any transmissions other than those preceded by the code letters . you got it ?	roger , i 'm setting up the crm-114 .
lieutenant toejam , are you ready for bim and bam ?	ready , major .
primary arming switch .	primary arming switch .
i thought i should check out the damage first . my gear is busted up pretty bad .	lieutenant toejam 's going to help you in a minute . can you check your ecm ?
so am i .	listen , i think i 'm hit bad .
where 'd they get you ?	damn you , lieutenant toejam ! lothar !
what does it look like ?	some kind of signaling .
no kidding .	let 's see ... international morse , i think ... k ... e ... o ... p ... e ... r ... e ... c ... a ... l ... l ... m ... i ... s ... t ... a ... k ... e ... o ... p ... e ... gee , i do n't know , it seems to be some kind of code .
yep , it 's the crm-114 code , all right .	very interesting .
gee , we hate to leave you like this , major kong . but there is n't anything we can really accomplish by sticking around .	forget it .
listen , king , old buddy . on behalf -- -	skip it and jump , damn you ! this flak 's so close , i can smell it .
in about twenty minutes we start losing height to keep under coastal radar . cross in over the coast low-level , continue low- level on zig-zag legs to primary , and climb for bomb run . any questions ?	i 've got one .
shoot , lothar .	our targets are a missile complex and an airfield - not cities , right ?
that 's what i said .	well , if there 's a war , they must have hit us first .
what 's your point , lothar ?	well , if they hit us first , they 've probably fired off their missiles and got their planes off the ground already . we 'll just be hitting empty real estate .
are you saying our order do n't make sense ?	hellnno , major . i was just trying to think the thing through .
check target approach .	bomb doors circuit is green , bomb release circuit is green , bomb fusing circuit is green .
check , all bomb circuits green . okay , lothar .	when do you want to arm the bomb for the primary , major ?
primary circuit is live .	primary trigger switch .
release first safety .	first safety .
second safety .	seond safety .
fusing for ten thousand air burst .	check , ten thousand air burst .
master safety .	master kong .
primary bomb is live .	all right , lothat , that does it . master safety on now until bomb run .
let 's have a rundown on the damage , lothar ?	everything still checks out okay .
yes , major .	lothar , get up here fast , and bring your first- aid kit ! i 'm hit kinda bad , i think .
ca n't `` ace '' help you ?	he 's dead .
what happened ?	i bit his jugular vein . now will you shut up and get up here ? ? ?
where 'd they get you ?	in the back ... feels like an arrowhead .
how do you know he 's dead ?	hell , he looks dead .
he 's dead , all right .	listen , give me a shot quick !
i do n't know what we got left besides bim and bam .	quentin , how 's your gear ?
no , look ! it 's `` ope - recall mistake . ''	recall what mistake ?
you sure have to hand it to those guys .	what do you mean ?
i mean pulling a stunt like that .	what are you talking about ?
what do you mean ?	well , we sure as hell are n't going home just because the enemy tells us to .
wait a minute , major . `` ope , '' that 's the recall code . where would they get that ?	you tell me .
they must have gotten it from the base . no one else would know it .	why should they call us back ?
lieutenant zogg , what do our orders say about the authentication of orders during an attack mission ?	look , this is different .
our orders warn us to expect the enemy to use ingenuity in issuing contrary and confusing orders . and therefore , to disregard anything that does n't come on the crm-114 .	but the crm-114 has been smashed for almost an hour .
then that settles it , does n't it ?	like hell it does .
the crm-114 is smashed , right ?	right . so how could we get any messages ?
that 's the point .	i do n't get you , king .
i said that 's the point !	look , king , maybe you 've lost too much blood , or something .
lieutentant zogg , how would you like your black butt slung into a general court martial when we get back ? ? ?	take it easy , major kong .
there are plenty of traitors and spies running around loose .	but the code is made up by general ripper , and he 's the only one left at the base who would know the code .
nobody 's loyalty is beyond question . besides , how do we know one of his staff did n't see it ?	come on , king . that does n't make sense .
we crossed the coast over an hour ago . okay ?	you 're giving them an awful lot of credit for being on the ball .
first lesson in war college : never under- estimate your enemy .	sorry , king .
who 's that ?	it 's me - lothar . are you okay ?
i 'm okay . what 's up ?	well , i hate to say this , but i think the bomb bay doors are stuck .
are you sure ?	well , i ca n't get out and look , king . but i do n't get a green light .
maybe the warning system 's out .	but i get a red light .
have you tried the emergency system ?	i tried everything . something must have gotten bent or twisted from the pounding we took .
lothar , can you arm the bombs for impact ?	but i told you , i do n't think we can get the bomb bay doors open .
i asked you a question , lothar !	but how are we going to drop the bombs if the doors wo n't -- - hey , king ... .you 're not thinking of -- - you do n't mean you 'd -- - ? ? ?
there 's no other way , lothar . can you re-arm the bombs for impact ?	let me check .
i think it 's okay , king . they should go off on impact .	would it matter if they hit at a flat angle ? i mean , do you think the deuterium mass might separate from the atomic trigger ?
well , it would probably help if you took it ... sort of ... straight down .	roger .
we 're on course , major . just fixed our position on that river back there .	what the hell are you doing here , lothar ?
i thought i 'd go along for the ride .	now what the hell did you want to go and do a thing like that for , lothar ?
king , would you mind if i keep me hands on the wheel when you take her in ?	i 'd be mighty proud if you did , lothar .
thanks , king . i 've always wanted to take one of these big babies in .	listen , lothar . you know that crack i made about your ... butt ?
forget it .	i just wanted you to know i did n't mean anything by it .
sure , king .	well , i just wanted you to know how i felt . hell , i know air command would n't have taken you if you were n't okay . and do n't think i do n't know some of our best ball-players and entertainers are of negro descent .
at the bottom of mines ?	yes . the radioactivity could not penetrate a mine some thousands of feet deep .
in a matter of weeks , sufficient improvements for a dwelling space could be provided .	but they could n't come out for a hundred years !
it would not be difficult . nuclear reactors could provide power almost indefinitely . greenhouses could maintain plant life . animals could be bred and slaughtered . a quick survey would have to be made of all the suitable minesites in the country , but i should n't be surprised if several hundred thousand of our people could be accomodatedd . every nation would undoubtedly follow suit .	but who would be chosen ?
when they emerge , a good deal of present real estate and machine tools will still be recoverable , if they are moth-balled in advance . i would guess they could then work their way back to our present gross national product within twenty years .	but , look here , von klutz . wo n't this nucleus of survivors be so shocked , grief-stricken , and anguished that they will envy the dead , and indeed , not wish to go on living ?
uh , yeah , she should be coming by .	uh , well , what 'd she say ? is pony coming ?
we are ?	alright . she told him to meet us here . fuck .
mn-hm .	`` burger manifesto , part one '' is gon na make people think ?
um-hm .	wait . racism ? you do n't know anybody who 's black !
i just walked all the way from westside to here . i have n't walked that far since junior high . i thought you did n't drink .	i do n't anymore .
can i have some ?	knock yourself out .
you know , one moment things are so fucked up than you look at it from a totally different angle and it makes sense .	yeah .
did you ever hear that saying , `` this too shall pass '' ?	sure , all the time , in group .
in group ?	rehab . outpatient . i have to go once a week . it 's kind of like aa .
oh , yeah , you had to go to highgate . that must 've been intense .	intense .
how long were you in there ?	uh , ninety days . and now i just have to go once a week . see , i 'm rehabilitated .
well , you should n't drink . are you gon na drink ?	no . oh , maybe . fuck .
i mean , that would suck if you had to go back to rehab .	yeah , it would suck big time . i 'd kill myself first .
it was pretty bad , huh ?	it was like hell with windows . you know , there 's shit on the walls . kids my age sucking their thumbs . i mean , every day i would , i 'd wake up in my cell and i 'd think , my parents put me here . why ? why ? because i stayed out all night one time . uh , because i broke the vcr when i was drunk . because i was out of control . i thought my parents loved me .
we were all riding around and it suddenly hit me what we were doing . we were getting off on the fact that we 're in a car teen feet longer than all the rest . and i got out and i just started walking .	yeah .
well , what it was ... i , i do n't want to admit it , but , you know , i was jealous of pony .	well , sure , he 's rich and he 's famous . he 's got everything and you 've got nothing .
yeah , but , when i was walking , i realized that he 's stuck in that limo all the time . he 's stuck with his interviews , he 's stuck with his autograph , he has to do whatever his manager tells him to do , you know ? he 's not free . he 's just part of the machine , and if you think about it , freedom 's all that there really is .	yeah , i guess .
you know ? and it used to scare me so much that i did n't know what was coming in my life .	mm-hm .
that was really great .	was it okay ?
yeah !	what did you guys think ?
slides go with it .	behind me . i 'm making these slides out of these old pictures and paintings and stuff .
it 's called `` burger manifesto , part one the dialectical expression of testosterone . '' is n't that a great title ?	why is everything about you , jeff ?
uh-huh .	i stand for something . and i 'm trying to communicate something .
responsibility , progress .	yes .
typical male .	typical male .
typical male .	tim , he listens to you . do you think it 's a good idea ? seriously ?
uh , home , you know .	yeah , i talked to your mom . i think i woke her up . i hope i did n't get you in trouble .
want a beer ? is pony coming ?	no , thanks . i do n't drink . um , well , what 'd she say ? i mean , did she talk to him ?
yeah , we all want to see him . so when 's he coming ?	yeah , when 's he coming ?
hey !	hey . do you have a cigarette ?
no i quit .	hey , you said you did a video ?
yup .	what 's it about ?
it 's really not about anything .	oh . well , what 's it on ?
a cloud .	a cloud ?
yeah . there was this cloud and i video taped it .	oh .
i was doing schrooms and i saw this cloud . it looks excellent on tape . the video is like my head and , and everything , you know , is , like , is like in there that i see . you know ? plus , i 'm gon na come down here one night and walk around inside the circle a with the camera and tape shit .	oh , that 's so amazing . i wish i could see it .
you can see it . whenever you want . do n't you , um , work at a hospital or something ?	yeah , i 'm a nurse 's aide at mercy .
your a nurse ?	no , i , you know , i help 'em out . i empty bedpans and bring 'em lunch . that kind of thing .
any gunshot victims ?	oh , some of 'em . but it 's mostly just strokes and shit . i mean , most of 'em just sleep all the time and get kind of yellow . usually they die id they 're , you know , really yellow .
sounds like a bummer .	oh , no , it 's not . i mean , they 're not all totally in a coma . i mean , they know when i 'm helping them .
mm . hey , what are you doing now ?	right now ?
yeah .	i do n't know . waiting , i guess . you know ?
do you wan na go to the van ?	now ?
yeah , we could hang out and smoke a dube , you know ?	i do n't smoke dubes and i do n't really hang out . but i 'll go back . okay .
guy should cut down on his caffeine intake .	needs some pizza in his diet .
oh yeah ? oh , how 'd you ship it over there , man ? federal express ? hm ? by the time it got there it 'd be way cold and coagulated . total waste . cheese be stuck to the cardboard .	buff , that slice is the difference between life and death for some half-dead bangladeshi .
yo , your gettin ' me all upset here .	you should get upset . everyone should get upset . when , when hitler was greasing the jews , people were saying , `` do n't get me upset . your bumming me out . '' my duty as a human being is to be pissed off . jesus christ , not that it makes a difference on the first fucking place . nothing ever changes , man . fifty years from now we 're all gon na be dead and there 'll be new people standing here drinking beer , eating pizza , bitching and moaning about the price of oreos , and they wo n't even know we were ever here . and then fifty years after that those suckers will be dust and bones and there 'll be all these generations of suckers trying to figure out what they 're doing on this fucking planet and they 'll all be full of shit . it 's all so fucking futile .
your ability to fantasize is only exceeded by your ability to lie .	oh , untrue , jeffster . i think , uh , two weeks ago we attended a concert where i had fucked two girls .
hey , it 's me . no , that 's , that 's the ultimate liar of liars .	and your mom .
no , i 'm here . where are you ?	where are you-hoo ?
no , no , no , no , i do n't wan na be stuck with the guy . i want the tickets .	stuck , who ? what guy ? huh ?
stuck with what guy ?	what ?
you said you did n't want to get stuck with some guy . what guy ?	no , uh , nobody . it 's , uh , it 's my birthday this week and sooze 's brother might come by to wish me a happy birthday .
it 's your birthday ?	yeah .
but , so , pony 's comin ' by here to the corner ?	he 's around and , you know , maybe he 's coming by . sooze told him to come by and hang out , whatever . it 's no big deal . me , him , and sooze are gon na ...
pony 's coming here to the corner ? !	yeah , no , it was n't even my idea .
i do n't know . later . i do n't know .	yes !
do n't let 'em fight .	the dude wants it .
no , i seriously doubt that pony 's gon na be in a limo .	that 's the rock star thing .
no , no .	oh , i 'll bet you he has a babe with him right out of a triple-x video . oh , oh , pony , come on , give it to me ! stud ! oh !
buff , buff , buff , buff , buff .	sorry .
jesus christ .	you wan na bet he 's with a girl ?
no , he 's not with a girl .	oh , right . oh , oh my god ! pony , it 's so huge !
you know what ? he probably gets bored with all that shit .	oh , yeah , yeah . wait , um , how do you figure that ?
i 'd get bored .	i would n't . if i were in his shoes , every morning i 'd get up singing , man . do my work-out , take a shower , followed by a hearty breakfast , steak and eggs , washed down with a pot of hot coffee , six pack of coors lite . then i 'd order my bodyguard to go find my babe , who would appear decked out in her all-black leather victoria secret custom-made bodysuit . so i 'd , like , have to chew off all her clothes until she was completely nude . except she 'd have these amazing dragon tattoos all over her body and pierced nipples with little gold peace signs hanging from 'em . and then she 'd take out this half-ounce of blow , we 'd snap out a few mondo lines , vaporize a few million brain cells , screw for about an hour , then spend the rest of the morning trashed watching gilligan .
that sounds so great , man . yes . yes . hey , what would you do in the afternoon ?	same , more of the same . yep , just keep doing the same thing all the time , around and around the clock . with an occasional burger or slice of thrown in for our vitamins and energy . then , instead of watching gilligan , we 'd watch captain kirk .
that sounds so depressing .	oh , come on , man . tell me you would n't love it !
no , i 'm not saying that i would n't love it .	ah !
i 'm saying no , i 'm saying after a while it 'd wear thin .	yeah , a long while . a long , long while .
a long , long , long , long , while .	okay , okay .
a long , long , long ...	okay .
so , do you guys want to do something , go someplace or something like that ?	so , we 're all old friends of pony 's . we go way back to our childhood .
go !	... idiot ! open the damn door ! go , go , go , come on !
you know what we should do ? go to the ...	so you can do an album cover ?
fuck it !	you know what ? go with him . just go with him .

i feel really bad about that , but i was busy , you know , i mean ...	no , look , this is not about sooze , alright . wait , wait , wait , wait . she stayed at the four seasons last night with pony ?
yeah , we all stayed at the four seasons , man . it was party time . hey , i hung out with danny , pony 's manager . really nice guy . we talked about the video . they want a raw look . something fresh . danny said if i can capture the reality of burnfield , it 'd make a great tape .	okay , buff , listen to me for a second alright ?
no , i know what you 're going to say . i do n't know anything about making a video . but that 's a plus .	no .
because since i 'm just starting out , i 've got a fresh point of view , and that 's good for , you know , marketing , demographics ...	buff , listen to me . could you just-
but i 'd , i 'd do it for free . you know , just for my reel .	buff , can you listen to me for a second ?
oh , and guess who showed up .	no , shut up ! look , look , alright , tim is in trouble .

you know , this , what you 're doing with your life ...	i do n't know .
you know , it 's not you . you know ? you seem like a smart guy .	yeah , well , thank you for the advice , but you would n't understand what is going on with me .
oh , it 's very complicated , huh ?	that 's right .

yeah , man , male , significant other , whatever the fuck i am .	it 's a piece .
your sure as hell right about that .	i 'm not doing it anywhere , jeff . it 's just part of my application to the school of visual arts in new york .
`` the worst i can do is starve to death . '' listen to you .	i do n't want to hear it anymore .
no , no , no . y-you know what ? y-your packing your bags , you 're jumping into the unknown because some conceptual artist who teaches at a community college is having a mid-life crisis and he wants to sleep with some girl half his age , so he tells you you have talent .	mister brooks has had shows in new york , jeff . he 's been reviewed in art forum . i think he knows .
oh , well , then you better listen to him .	well , fuck ! might as well not do anything ! let 's just stick out thumbs up our asses and twirl .
what are you trying to communicate ? tell us .	so you can give me more shit ?
no , no . it 's an honest question . what are you trying to communicate ?	i 'm trying to communicate how i feel , jeff . you know raise consciousness . make people think for a change .

i ca n't wait till pony gets here , you know ? have a conversation with a human being ?	well , if you love him so much , why did n't you go see him play ?
um , because you did n't want to go .	like i 'm going to pay twenty bucks to see neil moynihan in some band that i helped start .
this is ridiculous !	tim !
it was a racial incident .	it was just something that got out of hand . did anyone get hurt ?
it got that close .	okay , but nothing happened . believe me , if i thought something really bad was going to happen , i would 've done something .
oh , yeah ?	yeah .
okay , what would you have done .	i would 've stopped it .
how ?	i do n't know . i would 've done something . this is kind of hypothetical , is n't it ? this place is so stupid . i ca n't believe we 're sitting here in this mosh-pit of consumerism . with all these people eating their chunks of dead flesh ...
jeff . jeff .	... like fucking robots . look at those kids there .
jeff . you know , i was talking to mister brooks yesterday . he has this friend in new york who wants to sublet his apartment for six-fifty a month . i could swing that . six-fifty .	sooze .

what feelings ?	us .
of course .	and ?
come with me .	no , no , see , that 's not what i 'm saying . i could go to new york if i wanted to , but what 's the point ? so i can learn how to order a cappuccino ? so i can get mugged by some crackhead ? so i can see , see homeless people up close and personal ?
so what do you wan na do ?	nothing .
no one does nothing , jeff .	okay , well , then , i 'm gon na break new ground .
new ground ?	mm-hm .
taking one community college course on the history of nicaragua , while barely holding a job packing boxes ?	okay , look . my job is not who i am . i do n't need that . why ? what 's your goal ? status ? money ? getting your picture on the cover of some glossy magazine ?
my goal is to make art .	so , what , why ca n't you do that here ? what 's wrong with here ? why is somewhere else better ?
why should i stay here , jeff ? so we can sit on the corner and watch the lights change , while you bitch about burnfield ?	mm-mm .
so i can spend the rest of my life guessing what it would be like to be a real artist ?	no , no .
so you and i can fuck while your parents are out having dinner at the sizzler ? what are we doing , jeff ? you and me ?	i do n't know .
yeah , uh , that would depend , but yeah . she should .	mm .
yeah , but that does n't mean that your tree is not artistic if no one cuts it down .	jeff likes to argue for the sake of arguing .
no , i do n't .	yes , you do .
no , i do n't .	you do .
fuck ! pony , if we wanted to hear you sing , we would 've gone to your concert !	jeff !

and you know real cops are n't half as smart as keanu .	forget it . i 've got a scholarship to harvard hanging over my head . i wo n't risk it .
ahh ! baby 's got two heads ! ! !	it 's twins ! !

look , you 're fat , diane . you 're fat , fat , fat ! because you eat , eat , eat ! what ? ! she keeps asking because she wants some honesty .	no i do n't ... i keep asking because i feel fat .
oh g-d , i 'm sorry ... you 're not really fat ! i was just saying that because , uh , i thought that 's what you wanted me to say .	you sure ?
positive .	`` positive '' you 're sure i 'm not fat or `` positive '' i 'm ...
oh my g-d , i read about this ! it 's called a `` pregnancy insanity . '' quick , she needs a sitz bath --	look , i might be moody . i might be gassy . but i am perfectly sane . think about it . in school , they tell us , `` dreams can come true . '' right ?
c'mon , luce , people do it in the movies all the time .	and they get caught !
no .	if you do n't - can you still afford to go to harvard ?
... i do n't know . probably not .	so then this is n't crazy . it 's a sure bet .
but , we have to make a smart plan !	of course - of course ! hands in ...
okay , even with all our savings , it 's still only six hundred fifty-four .	hee-hee-hee , haaaaa-that 's it ? hee-hee hee ...
-- we practice ! sorry , cleo .	that 's right . practice makes perfect . i 'm practicing to have a baby right now . if we do a practice job , we 'll not only get the experience , but also the extra money we need for guns !
di , it 's luce . kansas just called and said she 's going to `` fuck me up ! '' then i heard coughing , a thud and kansas had to go . i think her grandma had another heart attack . anyway , why does she want to `` fuck me up ? ''	she thinks you went to the police .
what ? ! that 's insane ! ! ! why would i go to the police ?	i 've got to get that . relax . i 'll see you tomorrow .
hi , jack .	excuse me , vendela , have you seen diane ? we 're supposed to go to the homecoming dance tonight .
... so when your dad said , `` i never want to see your `` f-'in ' faces again ! '' do you think he meant forever or just until your mom wakes up ?	i do n't know ... and what the hell was that sound she made right before she hit the coffee table .
well , if i had to guess ... i 'd say that was the sound of a mother saying good-bye to her little boy and hello to a young man who 's going to be a daddy of his own ... jack , do you know what i see here ?	spit from your dad ?
i see a flower . and y'know , even the most beautiful flowers still grow from dirt .	yeah .
so , while we 're knee deep in right now - and things seem pretty `` stinky '' - in the long run , we 're going to grow strong from this .	y'think ?
i sure do .	diane , i 've loved you ever since i first saw you -- right before you kicked me in the head .
jack , sweetie , i 'm only eating for two .	but di , all this food reminds me of how much i want to teach our baby .
like cocoa puffs . good . captain crunch . bad . shreds the roof of your mouth . i mean you hear , `` tricks are for kids ! '' and you think , `` i 'm a kid , i guess they 're for me . '' but your baby brain 's got no idea that fruit loops are , like , a million times better . i 'm going to save our kid all that pain .	jack ...
if you could be count chocula , frankenberry or trix the rabbit , who 'd you be ?	trix ...
jack , i think i should get a job .	but we agreed your job is running the baby machine ...
i know , but that was before .	ah ! i almost forgot gas for the baby machine . i 'll grab your snickers and get a place in line .
i never knew you dreamed of working in a grocery store bank branch . baby , we are living the great american dream !	mmm-hmmm ...
if you reach for the stars , you 're bound to get -- mm-jack , pull over .	huh ? oh jesus ...
uh , jack - look , i can explain ...	diane , there 's no excuse for not taking your pre-natal vitamins . now , if you guys were really friends , you 'd remind her to take these .
... so although their dad said , `` do n't get out of the car until i get back with help , '' they knew the sheriff 's voice as he yelled . `` run to my voice - and do n't look back . '' the twins did as he said , but at the last second they turned around and saw the escaped mental patient , bouncing their father 's head on the top of the car ! ah ! they jumped , diane ! they jumped !	that was gas , sweetie .
oh ... what are you working on ?	jus some girlie things for the squad .
i 'm sorry .	what ? ! but all our paperwork 's there . my school records , jack 's football records ...
let me explain something ...	no . wait ! did i say promise ! cross-my heart and hope-to-die , stick-a-needle-in my-eye we 'll never miss a payment ? !
... do not accept charity . we are two young , able-bodied americans . we do not want a handout . we want a hand-up . give us food and we will be hungry tomorrow . give us corn - the kind you plant , not eat - and we 'll grow our own food and ... and , uh , then cut it , and - uh , y'know eat it ! now , if you 're interested in giving us a home loan , i will sit back down . if not , have a nice day , ma'am .	sorry . my hands are tied .
anyway , last time i checked , you still had to have sex to have an orgasm . and i know she ai n't seen the lord on all fours - so i 'm just saying .	well , i want to know what happened --
nope . sounds more like the first .	i 'll just ask the question myself ... `` is jack bartlett interested in me ? ''
madonna .	we 're here for you , diane .
hat-trick ?	he is the great one ...
`` no '' you 're not sure or `` no '' i 'm not fat ?	uh , `` no '' ... you 're not fat .
listen , kansas , i know you dream of springing your mom some day ...	stop , you 're gon na make me cry .
shut up .	lucy , do you know for sure you 're going to get that scholarship ?
kansas !	i 'm sorry , diane , but i 'm not gon na watch my dreams fade away 'cause the virgin mary here thinks she 's gon na get ideas from kiddie movies --
it 's all my fault . i 'm sorry i ever started this ...	di , it 's not your fault . we all wanted to do this - for you ... for ourselves .
oh , thank g-d ! i 'm not just super fat !	oh - okay , we ai n't done with this ... those babies are gon na get a good start in life - with a real crib - one that costs a shit-load ! we 're gon na learn how to rob a bank from the only people who really know how to do it - criminals ! i 'm gon na visit my mom !
no ! wait ... um ... we 're the a-squad from lincoln high ? so , uh ...	we were told you could `` fix us up . ''
hey . eyes on your own belly !	hee-hee-h-wait a minute . hold on , now . what do we do before a big game ?
oh no ...	he ikea 'd us .
it was lucy ! lucy went to the cops !	remember , kansas , every time you point a finger you 've got three more pointing back at you .
she 's been the weak tit on this mama cat since the beginning .	that you ?
yeah , hold on .	just call me later . i got ta get some smokes for grandma .
do n't use big bills !	for a pack of cigs ? i use her food stamps .
yeah ?	oh thank buddha it 's you , kim-lo , i 'm being held against my will , my civil rights have been violated and it took four days to make this one phone call ...
hello ?	kim-lo ?
no . this is diane . i think you have the wrong number .	ooops , that 's me -- got ta run !
yeah ?	i guess there 's an exception to every rule .
well , we 'll each probably want one - so let 's make it five . five should do it .	okay . how much ammo you reckon you 'll need ?
ammo ?	bullets .
bullets ? no bullets ! oh my gosh , these are just to scare people . kinda like round-off , back handspring , whip back , double full . you never really use it - you just want the opposing squad to know you 've got it .	right . that 'll be fifteen hundred - cash .
hey , hey , hey . c'mon you guys . obviously that 's a little more than our budget will allow . basically , we 're looking for something around two-hundred dollars .	oh , why did n't you say . for two-hundred i got a nice rubber band and a real sharp nail in back ... i 'll gift wrap it for you . the deal is fifteen hundred . cash . take it or leave it .
my daughter 's always dreamed of bein ' a cheerleader . put her on your squad and i 'll give you the guns .	you 're kidding .
... ja-ck b-ar-t-le-tt ... is jack bartlett interested in me ?	i-i 'm sorry - can someone else please run the ouija board ? it 's creepy , it 's wrong and it goes against the teachings of my lord and savior , jesus christ .
i-i did n't mean to say `` whore , '' diane . i just hear it so much at church - it kinda came flying out of my head .	i know , hannah . look , i 'm not going to get an abortion . i mean , i always planned to get married and have kids - i 'm just going a little out of order . kinda reminds me of another young lady who found herself `` with child , '' unmarried , on a long road , with no place to sleep . 'course , that was a long-long time ago . but no matter what , she held her head high and said ... `` pappa do n't preach , i 'm in trouble deep . pappa do n't preach , 'cause i 'm keepin ' my baby . hey . i 'm gon na keep my baby . '' the great one ...
you want us to help you pick up ?	do n't martha-fucking-stewart me ! if you do n't like it - you try being a pregnant teen !
and hannah , you could give your share to your church - or maybe buy one of those hungry little kids sally struthers advertises .	or , i could get my own horse ...
look , maybe i can watch a pg movie ... i 'll just say i 'm counting dirty words for sunday school .	that 's okay , hannah . it was silly to think we could learn to rob a bank from watching movies . sex - you can learn from movies . but robberies ? there 's no way .
hello ?	we 're dead ! they showed this prison movie to my youth group on sunday .
hannah , we 've ...	it was n't like the prison we saw - all these women had to shave their heads because they got lice from the filthy lives they 'd lived ! oh g-d , i 'm gon na be someone 's bald bitch !
... my sunday school teacher says that in prison , women shove broom sticks up your ...	hold on ...
screw lucy !	kansas ?
is that you down there ?	shit ! yeah , grandma . me and the squad .

oh well , then i 'll put some cookies at the top of the stairs for you gals .	thanks ! that 'd be great .
you got that big retarded girl down there ?	uh ... yeah , grandma . she does n't mean that . kinda lost the old filter with her last stroke .
then i 'll throw a few more treats on the plate . where 's my smokes ?	i 'll get them before `` touched by an angel , '' do n't worry .
really ...	yeah . `` itchy '' sent us .
she did , did she ? how is the old girl ?	definitely old .
oh please , we 've all got bright futures ahead of us - we 're not going to tell anyone . promise !	maybe we can make a deal .
hannah , in order to get real answers from the netherworld , you 've got ta have a christian virgin run the board . your kind is pure of heart - the devil wo n't dick with you .	well technically , i do n't think i 'm a virgin anymore .
yeah . this summer at church camp ? i 'm pretty sure i had , y'know , an orgasm .	hold up , hold up . any sentence that starts with `` at church camp '' ai n't leading to the big `` o . ''
oh my g-d ! i 'm not first !	but you 're not married .
... so , while it 's a laugh riot for the whole family , and tim conway is just about as funny as they come , especially when he goes ...	wait a minute . you watched the apple fucking-dumpling gang ? !

grandma and grandpa sent you pictures of a neighbor girl . they did n't want you to break out and come kidnap me .	thank g-d. i was starting to think i 'd killed the wrong man .
you should n't smoke so many of those .	i know , but it keeps down the size of my can .
they could kill you .	so could half the women in here . and i 'd rather go out with a nice can ... so watcha here for ? to say how much you hate me or how much your grandparents hate me ...
i do n't hate you . i need your help .	my what ?

i know - that 's what i said too . anyway , we want to help her get some money for the baby by robbing a bank .	well , shit-fire , kansas , that 's the sweetest goddamn thing ever ...
i know , but we ca n't quite figure out how to , y'know , do it .	so you need my help ? oh my g-d , this is like asking me for help with your homework . hey , mink , c'mere !
kansas , i want you to meet someone special .	oh , jesus christ , mom ! like my life ai n't a great big pile-of-shit 'cause you 're in here ? now i have to add , `` p.s . my mom 's a dyke '' too ?

what the hell do you want ?	i want to help . i 'm part of this squad ...
i hate to think where that puts me . i could be her father .	i 'm terribly sorry , mr. de mille .
it must be about that appalling script of hers . what can i say to her ? what can i say ?	i can tell her you 're all tied up in the projection room . i can give her the brush ...
listen , thirty million fans have given her the brush . is n't that enough ?	i did n't mean to --
of course you did n't . you did n't know norma desmond as a plucky little girl of seventeen , with more courage and wit and heart than ever came together in one youngster .	i hear she was a terror to work with .
we 're ready with the shot , mr. demille .	you 'll pardon me , norma ? why do n't you just sit and watch ? o.k . here we go .
roll 'em .	action ! the scene starts .

walking out on the mob . what 's the big idea ?	i 'm sorry about new year 's . would you believe me if i said i had to be with a sick friend ?
the accent ! i 've got it : this guy is in the pay of a foreign government . get those studs . get those cuff-links .	i 've got to run along . thanks any- way for your interest in my career .
hello , mr. sheldrake . on that bases loaded . i covered it with a 2-page synopsis . but i would n't bother .	what 's wrong with it ?
it 's from hunger .	nothing for ladd ?
just a rehash of something that was n't very good to begin with .	i 'm sure you 'll be glad to meet mr. gillis . he wrote it .
this is miss kramer .	schaefer . betty schaefer . and right now i wish i could crawl into a hole and pull it in after me .
name dropper .	i just think pictures should say a little something .
carefull those are dirty words ! you sound like a bunch of new york critics . thank you , miss schaefer .	goodbye , mr. gillis .
if i could be of any help ...	i 'm sorry , mr. gillis , but i just do n't think it 's any good . i found it flat and banal .
perhaps the reason i hated bases loaded is that i knew your name . i 'd always heard you had some talent .	that was last year . this year i 'm trying to earn a living .
let me help you . betty schaeter , sheldrake 's office .	sure . bases loaded .
hurt feelings department .	about that luggage . where 's the phone ?
you forgot this .	thanks .
i 've been hoping to run into you .	what for ? to recover that knife you stuck in my back ?
i felt a little guilty , so i got out some of your old stories .	why , you sweet kid .
there 's one called ... .window ... something with a window .	dark windows . how did you like it ?
i did n't .	thank you .
is there someplace we can talk ?	how about the rainbow room ?
now if i got you correctly , there was a short stretch of my fiction you found worthy of notice .	the flashback in the courtroom , when she tells about being a school teacher .
i had a teacher like that once .	maybe that 's why it 's good . it 's true , it 's moving . now why do n't you use that character ...
who wants true ? who wants moving ?	drop that attitude . here 's some- thing really worth while .
want me to start right now ? maybe there 's some paper around .	i 'm serious . i 've got a few ideas .
i 've got some ideas myself . one of them being this is new year 's eve . how about living it up a little ?	as for instance ?
well ... .	we could make some paper boats and have a regatta . or should we just turn on the shower ?
how about capturing the kitchen and barricading the door ?	are you hungry ?
hungry ? after twelve years in the burmese jungle . i am starving , lady agatha -- starving for a white shoulder --	phillip , you 're mad !
no , phillip , no . we must be strong . you 're still wearing the uniform of the coldstream guards ! furthermore , you can have the phone now .	o.k . i find i 'm terribly afraid of losing you .
you wo n't . i 'll get us a refill of this awful stuff .	you 'll be waiting for me ?
with a wildly beating heart .	life can be beautiful !
hello , artie . good evening , miss schaefer .	you do n't know how glad i am to see youl
stop it , artie , will you ? where have you been keeping your- self ? i 've got the most wonderful news for you .	i have n't been keeping myself at all . not lately .
i called your agent . i called the screen writers guild . finally your old apartment gave me some crestview number . there was always somebody with an accent growling at me . you were not there . you were not to be spoken to . they never heard of you .	is that so ? what 's the wonderful news ?
sheldrake likes that angle about the teacher .	what teacher ?
dark windows . i got him all hopped up about it .	you did ?
he thinks it could be made into something .	into what ? a lampshade ?
o.k . where 's the cash ?	where 's the story ? i bluffed it out with a few notions of my own . it 's really just a springboard . it needs work .
i was afraid of that .	i 've got twenty pages of notes . i 've got a pretty good character for the man .
sorry , miss schaefer , but i 've given up writing on spec .	i tell you this is half sold .
it 's not your career -- it 's mine . i kind of hoped to get in on this deal . i do n't want to be a reader all my life . i want to write .	sorry if i crossed you up .
you sure have .	so long .
just so you do n't think i 'm a complete swine -- if there 's anything in dark windows you can use , take it . it 's all yours .	well , for heaven 's sake !
i mean it . it 's no good to me anyway . help yourself .	why should you do that ?
if you get a hundred thousand for it , you buy me a box of chocolate creams . if you get an oscar , i get the left foot .	you know , i 'd take you up on that in a minute . i 'm just not good enough to do it all by myself .
what about all those ideas you had ?	see if they make sense . to begin with , i think you should throw out all that psychological stuff -- exploring a killer 's sick mind .
psychopaths sell like hotcakes .	this story is about teachers -- their threadbare lives , their struggles . here are people doing the most important job in the world , and they have to wprry about getting enough money to re-sole their shoes . to me it can be as exciting as any chase , any gunplay .
check .	now i see her teaching day classes while he teaches night school . the first time they meet ...
look , if you do n't mind , i have n't got time to listen to the whole plot ...	i 'll make it short .
sorry . it 's your baby now .	i 'm not good enough to write it alone . we 'll have to do it together .
i 'm all tied up . i ca n't .	could n't we work in the evenings ? six o'clock in the morning ? this next month i 'm completely at your disposal . artie is out of town .
what has artie to do with it .	we 're engaged .
good for you . you 've got yourself the best guy in town .	i think so . they 're on location in arizona , shooting a western . i 'm free every evening , every week- end . if you want , we could work at your place .
it 's just impossible .	nobody can be that busy .
look , betty , it ca n't be done . it 's out .	you 're tough , all right .
you 're on your own . stop being chicken-hearted and write that story .	honest to goodness , i hate you .
and do n't make it too dreary . how about this for a situation : she teaches daytimes . he teaches at night . right ? they do n't even know each other , but they share the same room . it 's cheaper that way . as a matter of fact , they sleep in the same bed -- in shifts , of oourse .	are you kidding ? because i think it 's good .
so do i .	came on back . let me show you where it fits in .
oh , you --	and here 's a title : an apple for the teacher .
good .	what 's good about it ? i miss him something fierce .
i mean this is good dialogue along in here . it 'll play .	it will ?
sure . especially with lots of music underneath , drowning it out .	do n't you sometimes hate yourself ?
who 's norma ?	who 's who ?
i 'm sorry . i do n't usually read private cigarette cases .	oh , that . it 's from a friend of mine . a middle-aged lady , very foolish and very generous .
i 'll say . this is solid gold .	i gave her some advice on an idiotic script .
it 's that old familiar story , you help a timid little soul across a crowded street . she turns out to be a multimillionaire and leaves you all her money .	that 's the trouble with you readers . you know all the plots . now suppose you proof-read page ten while the water boils .
look at this street . all card- board , all hollow , all phoney . all done with mirrors . i like it better than any street in the world . maybe because i used to play here when i was a kid .	what were you -- a child actress ?
i was born just two blocks from this studio . right on lemon grove avenue . father was head elec- trician here till he died . mother still works in wardrobe .	second generation , huh ?
third . grandma did stunt work for pearl white . i come from a picture family . naturally they took it for granted i was to become a great star . so i had ten years of dramatic lessons , diction , dancing . then the studio made a test . well , they did n't like my nose -- it slanted this way a little . i went to a doctor and had it fixed . they made more tests , and they were crazy about my nose -- only they did n't like my acting .	nice job .
should be . it cost three hundred dollars .	saddest thing i ever heard .
not at all . it taught me a little sense . i got me a job in the mail room , worked up to the stenographic . now i 'm a reader ...	come clean , betty . at night you weep for those lost closeups , those gala openings ...
not once . what 's wrong with being on the other side of the cameras ? it 's really more fun .	three cheers for betty schaefer ! i will now kiss that nose of yours .
may i say you smell real special .	it must be my new shampoo .
that 's no shampoo . it'smore like a pile of freehly laundred hand- kerchiefs , like a brand new auto- mobile . how old are you anyway ?	twenty-two .
hey , what 's the matter ... betty , wake up ! why are you staring at me like that ?	was i ? i 'm sorry .
what 's wrong with you tonight ? what is it , betty ?	something came up . i do n't want to talk about it .
why not ?	i just do n't .
betty , there 's no use running out on it . let 's face it , what- ever it is .	it 's nothing . i got a telegram from artie .
from artie . what 's wrong ?	he wants me to come on to arizona . he says it only oosts two dollars to get married there . it would kind of save us a honeymoon .
stop crying . you 're getting married . that 's what you 've always wanted .	i do n't want it now .
why not ? do n't you love artie ?	of course i love him . i always will . i 'm just not in love with him any more .
what happened ?	you did .
hello , betty .	i do n't know why i 'm so scared , joe . is it something awful ?
ever been in one of these old hollywood palazzos ? that 's from when they were making eighteen thou- sand a week , and no taxes . careful of these tiles , they 're slippery . valentino used to dance here .	this is where you live ?
you bet .	whose house is it ?
hers .	whose ?
just look around . there 's a lot of her spread about . if you do n't remember the face , you must have heard the name of norma desmond .	that was norma desmond on the phone ?
want something to drink ? there 's always champagne on ice , and plenty of caviar .	why did she call me ?
her own movie theatre .	i did n't come here to see a house . what about norma desmond ?
i 'm trying to tell you . this is an enormous place . eight master bedrooms . a sunken tub in every bathroom . there 's a bowling alley in the cellar . it 's lonely here , so she got herself a companion . a very simple set-up : an older woman who is well-to-do . a younger man who is not doing too well ... can you figure it out yourself ?	no .
all right . i 'll give you a few more clues .	no , no ! i have n't heard any of this . i never got those telephone calls . i 've never been in this house ... get your things together . let 's get out of here .
all my things ? all the eighteen suits , all the custom-made shoes and the eighteen dozen shirts , and the cuff-links and the platinum key- chains , and the cigarette cases ?	come on , joe .
come on where ? back to a one-room apartment that i ca n't pay for ? back to a story that may sell and very possibly will not ?	if you love me , joe .
look , sweetie -- be practical . l 've got a good thing here . a long-term contract with no options . i like it that way . maybe it 's not very admirable . well , you and artie can be admirable .	joe , i ca n't look at you any more .
hello , young fellow .	hello , mr. demille .
last time i saw you was someplace very gay . i remember waving to you . i was dancing on a table .	lots of people were . lindbergh had just landed in paris . come on in .
norma , i want to apologize for not calling you .	you 'd better . i 'm very angry .
i 'm pretty busy , as you can see ...	that 's no excuse . you read the script , did n't you ?
yes , i did .	then you could have picked up the phone yourself instead of leaving it to one of your assistants .
what assistant ?	do n't play innocent . somebody named gordon cole .
gordon cole ?	and if you had n't been pretty darned interested in that script , he would n't have tried to get me on the phone ten times .
did you see them ? did you see how they came ?	you know , crazy things happen in this business . i hope you have n't lost your sense of humor ...
goodbye , young fellow . we 'll see what we can do .	i 'm not worried . everything will be fine . the old team together . nothing can stop us .
what 's the matter , norma ?	nothing . i just did n't realize what it would be like to come back to the old studio . i had no idea how i 'd missed it .
we 've missed you too , dear .	we 'll be working again , wo n't we , chief ? we 'll make our greatest picture .
that 's what i want to talk to you about .	it 's a good script , is n't it ?
it 's got a lot of good things . of course , it would be an expensive picture ...	i do n't care about the money . i just want to work again . you do n't know what it means to know that you want me .
nothing would thrill me more -- if it were possible .	but remember , darling -- i do n't work before ten in the morning , and never after 4:30 in the afternoon .
i would n't know .	i do n't care anyway . i want the coffin to be white . and i want it specially lined with satin . white , or deep pink .
how much will it be ? i warn you - do n't give me a fancy price just because i 'm rich .	lady . you 've got the wrong man .
i had some trouble with my car . flat tire . i pulled into your garage till i could get a spare . i thought this was an empty house .	it is not . get out .
i 'm sorry , and i 'm sorry you lost your friend , and i do n't think red is the right color .	get out .
or shall i call my servant ?	i know your face . you 're norma desmond . you used to be in pictures . you used to be big .
i am big . it 's the pictures that got small .	i knew there was something wrong with them .
they 're dead . they 're finished . there was a time when this busi- ness had the eyes of the whole wide world . but that was n't good enough . oh , nol they wanted the ears of the world , too . so they opened their big mouths , and out came talk , talk , talk ...	that 's where the popcorn business comes in . you buy yourself a bag and plug up your ears .
look at them in the front offices -- the master minds ! they took the idols and smashed them . the fairbankses and the chaplins and the gilberts and the valentinos . and who have they got now ? some nobodies -- a lot of pale little frogs croaking pish-poshl	do n't get sore at me . i 'm not an executive . i 'm just a writer .
ssh ! you 'll wake up that monkey .	get out !
just a minute , you !	yeah ?
you 're a writer , you said .	why ?
are you or are n't you ?	i think that 's what it says on my driver 's license .
and you have written pictures , have n't you ?	sure have . the last one i wrote was about cattle rustlers . before they were through with it , the whole thing played on a torpedo boat .
the wind gets in that blasted pipe organ . i ought to have it taken out .	or teach it a better tune .
how long is a movie script these days ? i mean , how many pages ?	depends on what it is -- a donald duck or joan or arc .
this is to be a very important picture . i have written it myself . took me years .	looks like enough for six impor- tant pictures .
it 's the story or salome . i think i 'll have demille direct it .	uh-huh .
we 've made a lot of pictures together .	and you 'll play salome ?
who else ?	only asking . i did't know you were planning a comeback .
i hate that word . it is a return . a return to the millions of people who have never forgiven me for deserting the screen .	fair enough .
salome -- what a woman ! what a part ! the princess in love with a holy man . she dances the dance of the seven veils . he rejects her , so she demands his head on a golden tray , kissing his cold , dead lips .	they 'll love it in pomona .
they will love it every place . read it . read the scene just before she has him killed !	right now ? never let another writer read your stuff . he may steal it .
well ?	this is fascinating .
of course it is .	maybe it 's a little long and maybe there are some repetitions ... but you 're not a professional writer .
i wrote that with my heart .	sure you did . that 's what makes it great . what it needs is a little more dialogue .
what for ? i can say anything i want with my eyes .	it certainly could use a pair of shears and a blue pencil .
i will not have it butchered .	of course not . but it ought to be organized . just an editing job . you can find somebody .
who ? i 'd have to have somebody i can trust . when were you born -- i mean , what sign of the zodiac ?	i do n't know .
what month ?	december twenty-first .
sagittarius . i like sagittarians . you can trust them .	thank you .
i want you to do this work .	me ? i 'm busy . just finished one script . i 'm due on another assignment .
you know , i 'm pretty expensive . i get five hundred a week .	i would n't worry about money . i 'll make it worth your while .
maybe i 'd better take the rest of the script home and read it -	oh no . i could n't let it out of my house . you 'll have to finish it here .
it 's getting kind of late --	are you married , mr. -- ?
the name is gillis . i 'm single .	where do you live ?
hollywood . the alto nido apart- ments .	there 's something wrong with your car , you said .
there sure is .	you can stay here .
i do n't know why you should be so upset . stop that playing , max . it seemed like a good idea -- if we are to work together .	look , i 'm supposed to fix up your script . there 's nothing in the deal about my staying here .
you 'll like it here .	thanks for the invitation , but i have my own apartment .
you ca n't work in an apartment where you owe three months ' rent .	i 'll take care of that .
it 's all taken care of . it 's all paid for .	i 'm used to paying my own bills .
you proud boy , why did n't you tell me you were having difficulties .	okay . we 'll deduct it from my salary .
now , now , do n't let 's be small about such matters . we wo n't keep books . go on , unpack mr. gillis ' things .	unpack nothing . i did n't say i was staying .
what 's that ?	just a scene i cut out .
what scene ?	the one where you go to the slave market . you can cut right to the scene where john the baptist -
cut away from me ?	honestly , it 's a little old hat . they do n't want that any more .
they do n't ? then why do they still write me fan letters every day . why do they beg me for my photo- graphs ? because they want to see me , me , me ! norma desmond .	okay .
i want to talk to you for a minute .	not now , my dear . i 'm playing three no trump .
they 've come for my car .	please . now i 've forgotten how many spades are out .
i need some money right now .	ca n't you wait till i 'm dummy ?
now what is it ? where 's the fire ?	i 've lost my car .
oh ... and i thought it was a matter of life and death .	it is to me . that 's why i came to this house . that 's why i took this job -- ghost writing !
that 's a dreadful shirt you 're wearing .	what 's wrong with it ?
nothing , if you work in a fill- ing station . and i 'm getting rather bored with that sport jacket , and those same baggy pants . max , what 's a good men 's shop in town ? the very best ... well , go there !	i do n't need any clothes , and i certainly do n't want you buy- ing them for --
how about some evening clothes ?	i do n't need a tuxedo .
of course you do . a tuxedo and tails .	tails . that 's ridiculous .
joe , you look absolutely divine . turn around !	
all padding . do n't let it fool you .	come here !
you know , to me dressing up was always just putting on my dark blue suit .	i do n't like those studs they 've sent . i want you to have pearls . nice big pearls .
now , i 'm not going to wear ear- rings , i can tell you that .	cute . let 's have some drinks .
should n't we wait for the others ?	careful , it 's slippery . i had it waxed .
not on the same floor with valentino !	just follow me .
do n't bend back like that .	it 's those feathers . they tickle .
it 's a quarter past ten . what time are they supposed to get here ?	who ?
the other guests ?	there are no other guests . we do n't want to share this night with other people . this is for you and me .
hold me tighter .	come midnight , how about blind- folding the orchestra and smash- ing champagne glasses on max 's head ?
you think this is all very funny .	a little .
is it funny that i 'm in love with you ?	what 's that ?
what are the notes ?	`` mad about the boy . ''
norma , i ca n't take it . you 've bought me enough .	shut up . i 'm rich . i 'm richer than all this new hollywood trash . i 've got a million dollars .
keep it .	i own three blocks downtown . i have oil in bakersfield -- pumping , pumping , pumping . what 's it for but to buy us anything we want .
what 's the matter with you ?	what right do you have to take me for granted ?
what right ? do you want me to tell you ?	has it ever occurred that i may have a life of my own ? that there may be some girl i 'm crazy about ?
who ? some car hop , or a dress extra ?	why not ? what i 'm trying to say is that i 'm all wrong for you . you want a valentino -- somebody with polo ponies -- a big shot --
go away .	what kind of a silly thing was that to do ?
to fall in love with you -- that was the idiotic thing .	it sure would have made attractive headlines : great star kills her- self for unknown writer .
go away . go to that girl of yours .	look , i was making that up because i thought the whole thing was a mistake . i did n't want to hurt you . you 've been good to me . you 're the only person in this stinking town that has been good to me .
why do n't you just say thank you and go , go , go --	not until you promise to act like a sensible human being .
you 're really going to send it to de mille ?	this is the right day .
did she read the script ?	demille is leo . i 'm scorpio . mars has been transmitting jupiter for weeks . today is the day of greatest conjuction . now turn around . let me dry you .
i hope you realize , norma , that scripts do n't sell on astrologers ' charts .	i 'm not just selling the script . i 'm selling me . demille always said i was his greatest star .
when did he say it , norma ?	so he said it quite a few years ago . so what ? i never looked better in my life . do you know why ? because i 've never been as happy in my life .
have one of mine .	they 're awful . they make me cough .
pull up at the drugstore , will you , max . i 'll get you some .	you 're a darling .
what on earth , darling ? it took you hours .	i ran into some people i knew .
where are my cigarettes ?	where are your ... ?
i can still see myself in the line : bebe daniels , marie prevost , mabel normand ... mabel was always stepping on my feet ... what 's the matter with you , darling ? why are you so glum ?	nothing is the matter . i 'm having a great time . show me some more .
how do you like that ? we 've made twelve pictures together . his greatest successes .	maybe demille is shooting .
do n't you want to come along , darling ?	i do n't think so . it 's your script . it 's your show . good luck .
how did it go ?	it could n't have gone better . it 's practically set . of course , he has to finish this picture first , but mine will be his next .
he must be quite a guy .	he'a a shrewd old fox . he can smell box office . only i 'm going to outfox him a litt1e . this is n't going to be c. b. demille 's salome . it 's going to be norma desmond 's salome , a norma desmond production , starring norma desmond ... home , max .
do n't turn around . keep your eyes on the book .	yes , norma .
i just came to say good night . i do n't want you to see me -- i 'm not very attractive .	good night .
i 've lost half a pound since tuesday .	good .
i was a little worried about the line of my throat . this woman has done wonders with it .	good .
you 'd better get to bed yourself .	i think i 'll read a little .
you went out last night , did n't you , joe ?	why do you say that ?
i just happen to know it . i had a nightmare and i screamed for you . you were n't here . where were you ?	i went for a walk .
no you did n't . you took the car .	all right , i drove to the beach . norma , you do n't want me to feel i 'm locked up in this house ?
of course not , joe . it 's just that i do n't want to be left alone . not now , while i 'm under this terrible strain . my nerves are being torn apart . all i ask is for you to be a little patient and a little kind .	i have n't done anything , norma .
what are you doing , joe ? what are you doing ? you 're not leaving me ?	yes , i am , norma .
no , you 're not . max ! max !	max is a good idea . he can help with my luggage . thanks for letting me wear the handsome wardrobe . and thanks for the use of all the trinkets .
the rest of the jewelry is in the top drawer .	it 's yours , joe . i gave it to you .
and i 'd take it in a second , norma -- only it 's a little too dressy for sitting behind the copy desk in dayton , ohio .	these are nothing . you can have anything you want if you 'll only stay . what is it you want -- money ?
norma , you 'd be throwing it away . i do n't qualify for the job , not any more .	you ca n't do this ! max ! max ! ... i ca n't face life without you , and i 'm not afraid to die , you know .
that 's between you and yourself , norma .	you think i made that up about the gun ...
see , you did n't believe me ! .. now i suppose you do n't think i have the courage !	oh . sure -- if it would make a good scene .
you do n't care . do you ? but hundreds of thousands of people will carel	wake up , norma . you 'd be killing yourself to an empty house . the audience left twenty years ago . now face it .
that 's a lie ! they still want me !	no , they do n't .
what about the studio ? what about de mille ?	he was trying to spare your feelings . the studio wanted to rent your car .
wanted what ?	de mille did n't have the heart to tell you . none of us has had the heart .
that 's a lie ! they want me , they want me ! i get letters every day !	you tell her , max . come on , do her that favor . tell her there is n't going to be any picture -- there are n't any fan letters , except the ones you write yourself .
you heard him . i 'm a star !	norma , grow up . you 're a woman of fifty . there 's nothing tragic about being fifty - not unless you try to be twenty-five .
i 'm the greatest star of them all .	goodbye . norma .
i just put my car in the garage . i had a blow-out . i thought --	go on in .
look , maybe i 'd better take my car --	wipe your feet !
you are not dressed properly .	dressed for what ?
suppose you listen just for a minute -	madame is waiting .
i made your bed this afternoon .	thanks . how did you know i was going to stay , this afternoon ?
this room has not been used for a long time .	it will never make house beautiful . i guess it 's o.k . for one night .
there is the bathroom . i put in soap and a toothbrush .	thanks . say , she 's quite a character , that norma desmond .
she was the greatest . you would n't know . you are too young . in one week she got seventeen thousand fan letters . men would bribe her mani- curist to get clippings from her fingernails . there was a maharajah who came all the way from hyderabad to get one of her stockings . later , he strangled himself with it .	i sure turned into an interesting driveway .
i 'm talking to you . my clothes and things are up in the room .	naturally . i brought them myself .
is that so !	why are you so upset ? is there anything missing ?
some men are here . they asked for you .	i 'm not here .
that 's what i told them .	good .
whose room was this ?	it was the room of the husband . or of the husbands , i should say . madame has been married three times .
hey , what 's this with the door ? there is n't any lock .	there are no locks anywhere in this house .
how come ?	the doctor suggested it .
what doctor ?	madame 's doctor . she has moments of melancholy . there have been some suicide attempts .
uh-huh ?	we have to be very careful . no sleeping pills , no razor blades . we shut off the gas in her bed- room .
why ? her career ? she got enough out of it . she 's not forgotten . she still gets those fan letters .	i would n't look too closely at the postmarks .
you send them . is that it , max ?	i 'd better press your evening clothes , sir . you have not for- gotten madame 's new year 's party .
no , i have n't . i suppose all the waxworks are coming ?	i do n't know , sir . madame made the arrangements .
how is she ?	she is upstairs .
mr. gillis , if you please .	right with you .
you see those offices there , mr. gillis ? they used to be her dressing room , the whole row .	that did n't leave much for wallace reid .
what 's the matter , max ?	i just found out why all those tele- phone calls . it is not miss desmond they want . it is the car they want to rent .
what is it , max ? want to wash the car , or are you doing a little spying in your off hours ?	you must be very careful as you cross the patio . madame may be watching .
how about my going up the kitchen stairs and undressing in the dark . will that do it ?	i 'm not inquiring where mr. gillis goes every night ...
why do n't you ? i 'm writing a script and i 'm dying to finish it , no matter what .	it 's just that i 'm very worried about madame .
sure you are . and we 're not help- ing her any , feeding her lies and more lies . getting herself ready for a pioture ... what happens when she finds out ?	she never will . that is my job . it has been for a long time . you must understand i discovered her when she was eighteen . i made her a star . i can not let her be destroyed .
you made her a star ?	i directed all her early pictures . there were three young directors who showed promise in those days : d.w. grirrith , c.b . demille , and max von mayerling .
and she 's turned you into a servant .	it was i who asked to come back , humiliating as it may seem . i could have gone on witn my career , only i found everything unendur- able arter she divorced me . you see , i was her rirst husband .
joseph c. gillis ?	that 's right .
we 've come for the car .	what car ?
relax , fans . the car is n't here .	is that so ?
i lent it to a friend of mine . he took it up to palm springs .	had to get away for his health , i suppose .
you do n't believe me ? look in the garage .	sure we believe you , only now we want you to believe us . that car better be back here by noon tomorrow , or there 's going to be fireworks .
all right , gillis . you 've got five minutes . what 's your story about ?	it 's about a ball player , a rookie shortstop that 's batting 347. the poor kid was once mixed up in a hold- up . but he 's trying to go straight -- except there 's a bunch of gamblers who wo n't let him .
so they tell the kid to throw the world series , or else , huh ?	more or less . only for the end i 've got a gimmick that 's real good .
got a title ?	bases loaded . there 's a 4o-page outline .
oh , you 're one of the message kids . just a story wo n't do . you 'd have turned down gone with the wind .	no , that was me . i said , who wants to see a civil war picture ?
well , seems like zanuck 's got himself a baseball picture .	mr. sheldrake , i do n't want you to think i thought this was going to win any academy award .
of course , we 're always looking for a betty hutton . do you see it as a betty hutton ?	frankly , no .
now wait a minute . if we made it a girls ' softball team , put in a few numbers . might make a cute musical : it happened in the bull pen -- the story of a woman .	you trying to be funny ? -- because i 'm all out of laughs . i 'm over a barrel and i need a job .
sure , gillis . if something should come along -	along is no good . i need it now .
have n't got a thing .	any kind of assignment . additional dialogue .
there 's nothing , gillis . not even if you were a relative .	look , mr. sheldrake , could you let me have three hundred bucks yourself , as a personal loan ?
could i ? gillis , last year some- body talked me into buying a ranch in the valley . so i borrowed money from the bank so i could pay for the ranch . this year i had to mortgage the ranch so i could keep up my life insurance so i could borrow on the insurance so i could pay my income tax . now if dewey had been elected -	goodbye , mr. sheldrake .
so you need three hundred dollars ? of course , i could give you three hundred dollars . only i 'm not going to .	no ?
how 's that about your being my friend ?	do n't you know the finest things in the world have been written on an empty stomach ? once a talent like yours gets into that mocambo- romanoff rut , you 're through .
forget romanoff 's . it 's the car i 'm talking about . if i lose my car it 's like having my legs out off .	greatest thing that could happen to you . now you 'll have to sit behind that typewriter . now you 'll have to write .
what do you think i 've been doing ? i need three hundred dollars .	maybe what you need is another agent .
you do not deny having killed this man , miss desmond ?	did you intend to kill him ? just answer me that .
was it a sudden quarrel ? had there been any trouble between you before ?	if it was a quarrel , how come you had the gun right there ?
this guy -- where did you meet him for the first time ? where did he come from ? who is he ?	did he have a wife ? did he had a girl friend ? did you know them ?
did the deceased ever threaten you ? were you in fear of bodily injury ?	did you hate him ? had you ever thought of doing something like this before ?
well , it 's one way to get her down stairs .	okay . and let 's have the car right outside .
bring something to drink .	yes . madame .
wait a minute . i want you to get out the car . you 're going to take the script over to paramount and deliver it to mr. de mille in person .	yes , madame .
madame is wanted on the telephone .	you know better than to interrupt me .
paramount is calling .	who ?
paramount studios .	now , now do you belive me ? i told you demille would jump at it .
it is not mr. demille in person . it is someone by the name or gordon cole . he says it 's very important .	certainly it 's important . it 's important enough for mr. demille to call me personally . the idea of having an assistant call me !
i myself was surprised at mr. de mille 's manners .	say that i 'm busy , and hang up .
if you will pardon me , madame . the shadow over the left eye is not quite balanced .	thank you , max .
cameras ? ... what is it , max ?	the cameras have arrived , madame .
what is the scene ? where am i ?	this is the staircase of the palace .
oh , yes , yes . they 're below , waiting for the princess ... i 'm ready .	all right . camera ! action !
you and your husband have been kind to me , alura . i have something to tell you : i 'm going away . soon .	but where ?
i 've discovered a new way into the phantom zone .	but the phantom zone is for criminals .
i 'm an artist , alura . my work comes first . other people come second .	how can you create beauty ... with a selfish heart ? the spiky insect-creature flies closer and closer around the little girl 's head , buzzing angrily . her look of delight turns to fear . she tries to shoo the creature away . it flies off toward the thin membrane that encloses the city .
but the power source , zaltar .	it could n't be helped . the city will have to make do with three .
but what will happen ?	the guardians will be angry . they may even send me to the phantom zone . you see , i did n't really have permission to borrow it . i must go explain to them ...
i said stop , i did n't say run into a brick wall .	what is it ?
what does it mean ?	the danger . the one nigel spoke of . it must be near .
oh , fiddlesticks . what could be dangerous about a baseball game ?	softball .
it must be the girls . one of the girls .	but which one ?
we 'll bide our time and keep watch . young girls just ca n't keep a secret . if one of them 's up to something -- we 'll find out .	and then , like great cats -- -we pounce ! and destroy !
bianca , try not to be so bloodthirsty when you 're at the wheel . ok ?	sorry , mistress .
is he your entertainment for tonight ?	he will be . in about five minutes .
i came as quickly as i could . what is the danger ?	it 's what we were warned about .
a storm dragon ?	no , a super girl .
why did she have to show up now ?	eliminate her .
that 's easy for you to say , bianca .	you can do it . you 're the most powerful woman on earth .
yes ! you own the coffer of shadow . nothing can withstand its power .	i 've been saving it . for the right moment .
what do i do ? i do n't know her name .	the naming of names is not necessary . just concentrate on her face . your shadow will do the rest .
next time , remind me to do this out in the yard .	yes , of course , it was foolish of me .
i think i 'd better keep it .	whatever you say .
home ?	no way . i 'm not going to let that little hussy make a monkey out of me .
sure glad you did n't let make a monkey of you .	shut up , and get me a hacksaw .
i do n't feel like it right now .	she did n't take it from you , did she ?
that little girl ? ha . now go on , get me some tools .	there 's no need . i learned the craft from my grandmother .
at last . ultimate power .	and the first thing we do is get rid of supergirl !
i do n't want much , selena . i have simple tastes .	what do you want ?
western europe .	i 'm sorry , but i already promised bianca she could have switzerland . you know how she loves to ski .
is this nigel 's doing ?	it 's a warning , that 's for sure .
maybe it was just an accident .	there 's no such thing as an accident . everything has meaning , if you can read the signs .
wait ... do n't leave me in here ...	it 's for your own protection .
what 's happening ?	i 'm taking you to the hospital .
let me out . i have to talk to you .	later .
do n't leave me .	i have to .
when can i see , you again ?	relax . tomorrow this will all seem like a bad dream . goodbye .
you 're alive ! she did n't kill you !	who did n't ?
that woman who 's after me . she hates you . because she knows i love you .	you love me ?
my angel . my goddess . i feel i 've always loved you all my life . i 'll die if i ca n't spend the rest of my life just looking at you , holding you in my arms ...	we have to have a long talk about all this .
this is my favourite place in the city .	are you sure it 's all right for us to be here ?
like it ?	yes . it reminds me of home .
where superman 's from ? krypton ?	no . argo city . it was on a chunk of rock that was part of krypton once -- -but we moved it to inner space .
i 'm sorry , i do n't understand .	it 's not important . the important thing is i 'm here to find something and i think you can he1p me .
i used to work here summers when i was a kid .	ethan , tell me more about this woman who 's after you .
let 's talk about us , not her .	tell me where i can find her .
but be reasonable . if i do n't do something to stop her she 'll try again . and maybe hurt you .	i 'll be safe with you . we can stay together the rest of our lives .
we ca n't do that .	why not ?
we 're from different worlds .	just give me a chance to show how much i love you . love changes everything . love makes everything possib1e .
all this talk about love , it 's silly .	you do n't like me ? you hate me ?
of course i do n't hate you . i do n't hate anyone .	what do you feel about me ?
there 's one sure way to find out how you feel .	what 's that ?
let me kiss you .	no .
you 're not afraid are you ?	of course not , but ... there are things we do n't understand .
if we wait until we understand everything we 'll be dead . come on . you can learn more from one kiss than from years in school .	well ... i guess one is all right .
is this how ?	terrific .
i thought i 'd show you one of my favourite places .	it 's paradise . we could be very happy here .
but i have to go back . i brought you here so you 'd be safe . from her .	you ca n't just abandon me . alone .
great ! i'ii build a house -- right over there , with a veranda looking out to sea . and i 'll plant a garden ! papayas , pineapples , bananas , mangoes -- - anything 'll grow here . and i'ii fish in the lagoon , and we can go sailing in a dugout canoe , and -- -	ethan -- -when i said 'a while ' i meant a couple of hours .
she said it would n't last .	what would n't last ? what 's the matter with you ?
i do n't love you any more .	just like that ?
away . from you .	but why ?
because you remind me of all the dumb things i said .	i sort of like what you said .
that makes it worse .	but i do n't understand .
hi .	hello . are you still mad at me ?
i 'm not mad at you .	it seemed that way to me .
i know i was acting funny -- -i 'm sorry . it 's just ... i miss it .	miss what ?
and now ?	and now ... the guitars are out of tune , and the words do n't make sense , and somebody unplugged the mike ...
you think so ?	i do n't see why not .
but what if -- -it was n't real ?	feelings are real . once you 've had them , they 're yours forever .
hey , listen , when all this blows over , maybe we could get together every now and then and see each other . and maybe something might . happen again . what do you think ?	are you asking me for a `` date '' ?
why not ? you 're a good-looking girl . and i 'm -- - available .	are n't you forgetting about selena ?
there 's something very dangerous about her . something evil ...	i know what it is . she has this lead container shaped like a gargoyle . inside there 's a silvery ring ...
that 's the power source that was lost from argo city ! that 's what i came : to find ! where does she live ?	in this big old house on orchard avenue -- -but you better stay away from there .
wait . do n't leave me .	you 'll be safe here . i 'll come back as soon as i have the power source .
before you go ...	what ?
and you can see how you feel about me , right ?	yes .
you 've had your fun , selena , the game is over .	she has hostages .
it 's her shadow-self ! her dark side !	how do i fight it ?
no thanks . i have friends in the resistance . they 'll vouch for me . i figure i might get a million bucks for my memoirs .	i 'll come back as soon as i can .
she 's right . they 'll string her up .	do you want to come to argo city ?
hey ! ethan !	hmmm ?
a little .	can you get us out ? it 's all a misunderstanding . we thought they were selling hamburgers in that place .
hey , i thought you were gon na mention us upstairs .	i did .
finished your estimate ?	well , there 's several ways to go .
you must be very popular in the neighborhood . i always see your truck parked around .	i have a lot of repeat business . people seem to like my service .
i bet they do .	what 's that big black scar on the ground ? like a fire .
what is it ?	a passionfruit smoothee .
to us . and to the seeds we 'll plant together .	i 'll drink to that .
oh no , not you again .	what an adorable hat .
they think i have a concussion .	and you think you 're in love .
i know it .	this `` love '' of yours will soon wear off . i gave you a temporary love potion .
why should i believe you ?	it 's the truth . in twenty-four hours you 'll forget all about that girl .
yes , yes i saw the whole thing . how could you be interested in that puny little girl ?	but she is real , it was n't just a concussion .
nurse ! nurse !	you ca n't escape from me that easily . i 'm afraid you do n't know who i am .
nurse !	do n't think i 'm weak , just because i 'm a woman . i have power . give in , stop fighting me , ethan . i always get what i want .
this is your problem , right here . this girl 's driving you insane , ethan . let me help you .	i do n't want your help .
no !	i never met a man i could n't have -- and you 're no different from the rest !
i 'm wise to your tricks , lady .	i could force you .
if that worked , you would 've done it already . no , you want me to drink it of my own free will . well let me tell you , sweetheart , it 'll be a cold day in hell before i fall for that one again .	go on , talk big ! i 'll soon have you purring like a kitten .
you 've been without water for a whole day . let 's see how thirsty you get in a week .	you vicious --
they want me . does n't it make you proud ?	yeah .
guess ! go on .	i do n't know . you seem afraid .
you 're a regular einstein , are n't you ?	supergirl ?
you ca n't put her out of your mind , is that it ?	well ... i guess i ca n't .
why the empty cage ?	that one was for you . but i thought i 'd wait and see how you behave when supergirl gets here . i 'd hate to lose you , ethan .
you sure are a good cook , selena . man , that looks too pretty to eat .	better eat it quick . it wo n't look too pretty when it 's all covered with ants .
selena , i 've been thinking . it 's time i settled down -- -and i do n't know a nicer lady to settle down with than you .	why george , are you proposing ?
marry me , selena . the hardware store does n't bring in much now , but ...	george -- -i thought you 'd never ask .
hey , where you going ?	i 've got things to do .
what about my proposal ?	call me next week . maybe we can have lunch .
nice to meet you . lucy 's told me all about you . your cousin clark taught me everything i know about the newspaper business .	nice to meet you .
do you have any theories about last night ?	theories ?
i believe there 's a rational explanation for everything . but i do n't know what it is .	can i quote you ?
where is your cousin clark , by the way ?	he 's off doing a top secret uh , investigation .
gosh , what do you suppose .that is ?	well , lucy , it 's nice to see you 're feeling better . nice to meet you , jimmy .
can i give you a lift ?	oh , no thanks .
someone 's chasing him .	say -- -you think that 's the same guy who was in the accident with lucy ?
yes .	the scoop of the year !
oh , jimmy , ca n't you forget about your career for one second ?	-- planet . i mean , you were there . do you think it was natural , or like some people are claiming , supernatural ?
jimmy , would you please put those poor flowers in water before they die ?	oh , sure .
i had to dump the papers in a trashcan . the danvers have been arrested !	how do you know ?
i saw them dragged out of the administration building .	did anybody notice you ?
i ca n't help it if men notice me .	lucy ! be serious . we could be executed for treason !
i sure wish superman was around . he would n't let any of this go on . not for one minute .	i wish they 'd tell us what they 're going to do with us .
i 've been in love with you for years . remember how you used to visit your sister in the newsroom ? and put your fingerprints on my lens .	remember ? i was trying desperately to get you 're attention .
you were ? you mean we could 've been ... you-know-what ... all this time ?	you bet your ass .
why did n't you tell me ?	you 're supposed to guess .
i am almost an adult . this is what i want .	but kara , no one has ever gone from here to earth . the journey is dangerous .
it was my fault we lost the power source .	years ago . and it was zaltar who stole it .
superman will return it .	why have n't you been able to contact him ? he should have returned from the neutron galaxy ages ago . he may be dead . zor-el but what can you , a mere girl-
be brave , my .daughter . be wise .	as brave as my father . as wise .
what are you making :	it 's going to be a tree , i think .
what 's a tree ?	it 's something they have on earth . you know , where your cousin went .
where is earth ?	did n't you study six-dimensional geometry in school ?
even i have trouble with that sometimes . earth is in outer space . and we 're in inner space .	i do n't understand .
you see , a tree is a living thing .	can you create life ?
i 'm sorry ... i did n't know .	it was my fault . you are n't old enough to use the wand . i should n't have given it to you .
i can do that .	no sweat . when 's the rest of your stuff arriving ?
there is n't any .	this is all your clothes ?
i have money to buy more , but i have n't had a chance since ...	since what ? ? did you have a fire at your house or something ?
i 'd rather not talk about it .	you 're not ... an orphan are you ?
my cousin clark is my only relative on earth .	oh wow , i should 've known . me and my big mouth . listen , you can borrow any of my clothes you want . any time .
she did that deliberately .	she 's a beast .
how 'd you do that ?	must 've been a defective puck .
keep an eye peeled for myra . she 's out to get you .	but what for ?
your hair looks the same .	it was just a trim .
no thanks . you go on .	you sure ?
linda babes ! there 's this all-night party at eddie 's ... his folks are away ...	oh , i do n't know . i 'm not signed out for an overnight .
go back , sign in , and climb out the bathroom window . mccloskey 's always zonked out : she 'll never hear you .	it does n't seem right .
why is he acting so strangely ?	i dunno , but he 's gon na get creamed .
lucy ; come back !	somebody 's got ta do something ! !
i 'm afraid i have some bad news about your car .	mr. danvers called . i 'll get a new one with the insurance money . b.f.d .
listen , i know i 've been saying you ought party more , but keep your hands off this one , will yak ? he 's private property . i 've been waiting years for him to develop .	he 's nice .
you 're not gon na stay for the ice cream ?	i have to get back . i 'm having dinner with the danvers .
do n't you believe in knocking ?	oh , yes . knocking . the pre-entry signal . i forgot .
what can i do for you ?	i 'm linda lee .
i mean , it would probably be there , if you received it .	here it is . oh ... of course . you 're the orphan . i 'm so sorry about your parents . we 'll try to make you happy here .
no plans for the weekend , linda ?	no , mr. danvers .
ca n't have you moping around the campus . why do n't you come home with us for dinner ?	i 'd love to .
thank you both so much . it was a lovely lunch , mrs. danvers . i had a wonderful time . and you 're a terrific chess player mr. danvers .	what ? me ?
cheer up , nigel . it 's not the end of the world .	it may well be . i know how you won that election selena . you ca n't fool me .
i have plans nigel . you could come with me ... i 'm going places .	you 're not going anywhere . except back to nowheresville . you 're too impatient , selena . look around you -- all these people have served years and years of apprenticeship . some of their families have been in the craft for generations . you ca n't join and take over our whole organization in a few months .
i just did . because i have the power .	you 're going to pay a terrible price . the power of shadow is tricky . use it too much and it takes over .
bianca 's taught me all ! need to know . i 'll be safe , as long as i do n't go too far .	cigarette ?
nigel , get out of here . and do n't come slithering back . nigel shakes his head .	you need me , selena . i 'm the only one who can save you from a terrible fate .
balefire on you , selena !	you scorpios can never take a joke .
you think you are on top now . well there is someone coming to challenge you . i saw it in the cards this morning .	throw him out .
nigel , get lost .	i have to talk to you .
you 're wasting your breath .	you used to listen to me . when you asked me to teach you something of the craft .
... trust the wisdom of the ancients , trust the great mother to protect us ... why . are you staring at me like that ?	i was just thinking , if i had your skin problems , i 'd use a good tannisroot ointment . every night .
nothing 's wrong with my skin .	such a shame . you ought to take better care of yourself .
you better have a pretty good explanation for this , selena .	we are in great danger . a being has come to earth with powers far beyond those of anyone member of the craft .
which of you is willing to make that sacrifice ?	you would ! you revealed our existence so you could have all of our power .
maybe you 'd like to get rid of this supergirl yourself , nigel ?	why get rid of her at al1 ? you 've used the coffer of shadow too much . it is beginning to rule your heart .
that was meant for me !	thank you . i 'm going to close this up again .
who are you ?	i am selena . give him to me . now . or you 'll both be sorry .
that ought to keep you out of my hair for a while .	a cheap trick .
the danvers . and two of your little friends .	it 's just one more crime you 'll have to pay for .
you 've run out of things to throw , selena .	not yet .
i 'm free . i can never thank you enough .	for what ?
ever since i found that thing i 've been like a prisoner in a terrible nightmare . you have no idea how awful it is to be mean all the time .	your nightmares are over . i 'm taking this back to argo city where it wo n't be misused . you could come too . it might be safer for you .
what 's it like ?	it 's the most beautiful place in the universe .
where is inner space ?	it 's everywhere . but water is always the door .
they 'll be grateful . if you had n't found it , it would still be lost . look , up ahead .	yes , i see it . shining like a jewel .
what is this place ?	this is the phantom zone . but why did you come here from argo city ?
i was on earth ...	earth ? you crossed the dimension barrier ? by yourself ?
shouldnt 've done that .	... but the person who has it . tricked me , and sent me to the phantom zone .
it 's dangerous to use a power source on earth . it can unleash all sorts of terrible forces -- -	i know .
others ?	criminals .
... mid pleasures and palaces though i may roam ... ''	what ? palace ? hardly .
it 's lovely . . .	no , no . not lovely . 'perfect ' . did everything just right . nobody telling you to change this , move that around . please yourself . that 's the secret of happiness .
are you happy , zaltar ?	what kind of a question is that ? of course : i am . i do whatever i want . all the time .
you look at them ? how ?	the phantom zone overlooks everywhere.. if you have the right tools .
that horrible woman !	told you . would n't listen to me . knew it would make you sad .
zaltar , please help me .	of course , my dear . what can i do ?
there 's no way out of the zone . no one 's ever escaped . that 's why they send the criminals here .	if there 's a way in , there must be a way out .
there is a way .	i knew it !
but it 's impossible .	why ?
then teach me how .	no , it 's no good -- -you ca n't practice -- - you only get one go . a thing like that . no . sure you do n't want a sip of this ? it 's delicious , i think .
takes a long time , you know , learning the wand . just begun to understand it myse1f . give things a kind of life -- can also take away life ; works backwards too . besides i ca n't let you take my wand . only have the one , what would i do ? i 'd be helpless . it 's out of the question .	then come with me .
leave the zone ? what would i do on earth ?	you could do anything . you could sculpt mountain ranges ... draw with rainbows ! you 'd have superpowers .
superpowers . got you in a lot of trouble , did n't they ?	please . i have to get back to earth . my friends are in trouble . and unless i bring back the power source , argo city will die .
you 're going to take me back ?	going to try . did n't say i could .
i heard my mother ask you once `` how could a man with such a selfish heart create beauty ? '' she was wrong , zaltar , you have a generous heart .	not doing this for you . just sick of this place , that 's all . wretched singing sculptures , always yowling at you . boring !
you can use the wand .	better than when i was a child .
what 's that ? never saw anything like that .	do n't stop . keep moving .
yes , must n't stop .	it 's selena . i 'm getting so i can recognise her work .
zaltar . use the wand !	too late . too late . save yourself .
goodbye ...	zaltar !
yeah ? what do you want ?	buddy , are we in trouble .
what ?	first the supplier could n't find the invoice . then the order came up short . then i missed the four o'clock plane from cleveland and had to rent a car , and then i got a darn flat tire on the highway ! can you beat it ? boy , your boss must 've been furious when i did n't show up by the end of the day today , huh ?
what are you talkin ' about ?	good lord , fella ! i 'm talking about your boss .
mr. roebush ?	roebush ! that 's the guy ! buddy , he 's gon na nail our behinds to the wall ! this is special order ! he said he had to have it before ... omigod ! ! what 's tomorrow ?
tuesday .	tuesday ! i got to get it all set up in his office tonight before all those big shots come here tomorrow for the meeting ! !
s'not bad , s'very good , but ... y'know what 's wrong with this ... singapore ... thing ?	sling . singapore sling . what 's wrong ?
not enough vodka in it .	there 's no vodka in it .
aha ! what 'd i tell ya !	what ? what did you tell me ?
got vodka in it now . got ta give it a new name . hey , listen , you thought it up , we 'll name it after you . what 's your name ?	brad .
brad is not a good name for a cocktail .	hey ! y'know what they used to call me in high school ?
brad ?	no , no , on the football field . they called me ... ... the smallville flash .
man , you do n't never pass out , do ya ?	nope . never .
here i am , honey , and i 'm all yours . remember when you were queen of the prom ? all the guys had to wait in line to get a dance . but now there 's only one name on your dance card , sweet thing , and it 's --	brad wilson .
hiya , sweet thing . little guy 's getting ' hassled , huh ? kent , you still here ?	i seem to be .
all the kid needs is a couple of pointers from the ol ' champ here . kent , i bet you did n't know i won the all-country bowling trophy two years in a row .	uh , no , i did n't know that , brad .
say , brad . i think he 'll be better off doing it his way .	for a guy who was lucky to be water-boy on the high school team , you sure got a big mouth , kent .
i just think ricky would rather not get a bowling lesson in front of the other kids .	the kid needs a man to show him --
lana lang . how great to see you .	clark .
you look wonderful .	you always did . can i give you a hand with that ?
you should n't say that , you 're the chairman -- ... uh , chairperson ...	and here i am , just standing here . that 's terrible . thank you .
you 're welcome ... ? ?	for reminding me , i mean . can you follow me ?
i ca n't clark already asked me . did n't you ? he used to love this song . did n't you ? so he just said -- `` would you dance with me ? ''	sure , lana , i 'd love to .
you 'd be surprised how many offers i did n't get . even brad would n't stick around for this . it really is n't easy .	the streamers ? they 're no problem , you just pull on them and --
and three years after the royal wedding , the king abdicated . is n't that terrible ?	it sure is .
you know what 's the problem ?	too much mayonnaise ?
mayonnaise ? donald loved mayonnaise . why would you think that was the problem . ?	i did n't --
no , the problem is -- why do i stay in smallville ? believe me , i 've asked myself the same question . do you know how lucky you are to live in metropolis ? the big apricot .	but lana , you could --
that 's easy to say . but how ? and what about ricky ?	who ?
you ... um ... you never got married ?	oh ... i came close once .
that song . i remember one day i came into the music room and you were fooling around at the piano . and i thought -- what am i going to do with all this potato salad ?	you thought that ?
i just ca n't stand this .	hey , he 'll be all right . believe me lana , i know . i was a late bloomer myself .
it is n't only that he 's small for his age . how would you like to be the only kid in town without a father ? look at him , he 's stewed to the gills in the middle of the afternoon .	but all he had was chocolate milk .
gee , i have n't done this in years .	some people do n't think it 's healthy .
well , it 's true you have to be careful things do n't spoil , especially with mayonnaise or cream .	clark , i think you worry too much about mayonnaise .
me ? ?	i 'm talking about salt . oh , go ahead , pour it on , relax . that 's what picnics are for .
and even nicer when there 's a man around , which is n't all that often .	there 's a lot of choices here .
no , all the good ones are married . that 's why brad thinks he 's god 's gift to women . this woman anyway . he 's single . he wo n't take no for an answer , but he 's the only one who 's asking . and he knows it .	i meant all the choices here . all this -- -- cole slaw , guacamole -- this is some picnic !
peanut butter and jelly .	no , thanks .
no , i mean ricky . he 's not interested in any of this stuff .	well , this pate is rather ... unusual .
gee , i have n't laughed like that since -- since -- i really ca n't remember when .	me neither ...
so ... how much longer do you think you 'll be in smallville --	you know , i was just thinking , lana -- -- someone like you could do do really well in metropolis --
i can never get a way from it .	old ties are hard to cut .
that 's the biggest change in smallville , you know . they 've taken over this town . everybody who is n't actually working for wheat king -- like i do -- is out there -- on a wheat king thresher . do you think i could do it ? do you ?	ride a thresher ? well , i do n't know . girls are trying just about everything now but --
no , what you said before , could i make it in metropolis ? i 've dreamed about it , sure , but i never really thought about it . what would i do when i got there ?	call me .
the dog 's always doing that . and the car 's always doing that .	can i help ?
he really was !	uh-huh .
well , are n't you excited ?	lana , i 'm from metropolis . i see superman every day .
gee , i always loved porch swings .	me too . that 's why i put this one up .
no , well in this case i think i can speak for him . i mean , i 'm pretty close to him , you know . superman will be there on wednesday .	well , he 's going to get the best home-cooked meal he 's had in ... in a long time . you tell superman we think he 's wonderful .
i guess he misses a lot of dinners .	but if you would n't mind settling for me --
hi , lois . morning , jimmy , you 've got mustard on your lapel . excuse me , mr. white , i do n't mean to interrupt but -- -	please , kent , not now . i 'm trying to put out a newspaper here .
mr. white , please , i promised those people i 'd get back to them by this morning . what do you think ?	look , i do n't know , kent . . . clark personally , i think it could be a terrific story !
i 'm getting a cramp in my elbow from this .	let me do it for you , mr. white .
-- but you deserve the vacation , lois .	oh . you 're going away .
uh ... excuse me , folks ...	kent !
well ... not quite like this .	mom and i do this all the time .
mr. kent ! superman was here !	what !
do you really know superman ?	we get together sometimes .
mr. kent , could i ask you something ?	sure .
hi . mister kent . guess who mom 's having dinner with tonight ? superman !	actually , that 's why i stopped by . he 's realy sorry , he wanted to make it , but then he ... ran into a problem .
anyway , the reunion 's just the hook for the story . what it 's really about is how the typical small town 's changed in the last fifteen years . how do you like this a title : can you go home again ?	say !
so , mr. white ? can i go ahead and make my travel arrangements ?	exactly what i was about to ask about me .
you 're the best , lois .	i 'd better be . suddenly i 've got competition to keep up with . your high school reunion article . i though it was terrific . and fascinating . especially about the girl back home . i 'll tell you what , clark , i 'll take you to lunch and you can tell me all about it .
gee , i 'm sorry , lois . but i 've already got a lunch date . with mr. white 's new secretary .	oh ?
it 's practically an american ritual , mr. white ! is n't that so , jimmy ?	i would n't know mr. kent . most of the people i went to high school with are still in high school .
but my uncle al , on my father 's side , he wo n't eat her stuffing , he says it should be cooked on the outside of the turkey and she puts the stuffing inside the turkey . so my mother told my aunt ellen . . . aunt ellen 's my father 's half-sister , i told you that , right ?	mmmmm . . .
the thing is though , my cousin arnold , aunt rosey 's arnold this is , he got mad when uncle al insulted his mother 's stuffing , so now the problem is --	what 's that ?
wow , what a beautiful sunrise !	at one o'clock in the morning ?
keep talking to that state trooper so he does n't notice where i 'm going , okay ?	what are you doing ?
name ?	gus gorman .
ah yes , august gorman . have you looked for work this week , mr. gorman ?	yeah .
what kind ?	kitchen . . . technician
dishwasher ? any luck ?	nope , but --
mr. gorman , according to our records you have been unemployed for 36 weeks .	thirty-five .
not counting this week . you secured employment last june as a messenger and were discharged after one day for . . .	they said i lost it on the subway , but it ai n't the truth ! it was a pickpocket took it !
a television set ?	well , it was one of them little bitty two-inch screen japanese jobs .
the only other employment you found was in a fast-food joint -- -- which lasted . . . 28 minutes ! well ! that 's some kind of record . talk about fast !	man , them people was crazy ! how they 'spect you to learn all that jive on the first day ? `` hold the pickle ! hold the lettuce ! extra onions ! special sauce ! no special sauce ! '' ai n't nobody found no meat inside that glop yet .
mr. gorman , the city of metropolis is generous to a fault , but . . .	i know , i 'm the fault .
thirty-six weeks of chronic unemployment , thirty-six weeks of living off the taxes of hard-working citizens . do you know what you are ?	do n't call me a bum ! i ai n't no bum !
you are , i was about to say , no longer eligible .	what about this week 's check ?
sonofagun ! look at this here !	first paycheck ?
first rip-off , man ! supposed to be 225 bucks a week ! you know what this sucker says ? ? $ 143.80 ! federal tax ! state tax ! social security tax !	that 's so you 're still getting some money when you hit 65 .
actually , it 's probably more like $ 143.80 and one-half cent . there 's always fractions over in a big corporation , but they round it down to the lowest whole number .	what 'm i gon na do with half a cent ? buy me a thoroughbred cockroach ? everybody loses them fractions ?
they do n't actually lose 'em . you ca n't lose what you never got .	who gets it , the company ?
no , not really . they ca n't be bothered collecting half a cent from your paycheck anymore than you could .	so where is all them half-centses ?
how many sugars ?	one . and a half .
quittin ' time , gus . comin ' ?	uh . . . no , man . i got some work to finish up here .
workin ' overtime ? what are you doin ' , buddy , looking for a raise ?	yeah . a raise . .
gus ?	say what ?
the boss wants to see you .	say who ?
please , mr. webster , you 're a great humanitarian . ai n't you heard what it 's like in them jails ? you send an innocent boy in and he gets thrown in with killers and robbers and rapers and raper killer and robber rapers and ...	mr. gorman , just answer me one question ...
you 've been a naughty boy have n't you ? c'mon now , admit it , you were kinda naughty .	uh ... yeah . i did n't think of it that way exactly , but ...
say , fella , i understand . i can -- what do the kids say these days -- `` dig where you 're comin ' from . '' you want to be rich , right ?	uh ...
now me , i was born rich . i 've never worn the same pair of socks twice .	yeah ? what do you do with 'em ?
i believe they 're laundered and sent to some charitable institution . i do n't know what the heck they do with 'em . maybe they use them for dust rags , or pen wipers ...	or socks .
yes ! that never occurred to me . her ya go , buddy , single-malt . gus , my friend , you 're a genius . okay , a naughty genius , but hell , nobody 's perfect .	'cause i know about getting ' them half-centses ?
gus , webco , the webster industrial complex , is a family-owned cartel . a little magnesium here , a little zinc there . some railroads here , some farm machinery there . you follow ?	i 'm tryin ' to .
gus , do you know what i want now ? i want coffee !	black or regular ?
man , what is this ?	plants . plants always make an office cozier .
under different company names . i control the price of coffee beans in brazil . the price in venezuela . java , south korea , north korea , the aleutian islands , guam , bolivia , and the republic of gabon !	decaffeinated too ?
but y'see , chum , the problem i got is that one country just wo n't play ball with me . you know how that can just bug a guy , do n't you ?	which country ?
columbia .	columbia .
wipe 'em out ?	destroy the entire colombian coffee crop down to the last bean .
but mr. webster ... you 're doin ' okay with brazil and them other places . what 's wrong with just one little old country doin ' their own thing ?	a very wise man once said ... i think it was attila the hun ... `` it 's not enough that i succeed . everyone else must fail . '' and you are going to do it for me .
gus , tell me , have you ever heard of vulcan ?	that what they call you ?
how do you do that ?	like everything else in the 20th century , gus . you push buttons .
always making yourself beautiful for me , are n't you ? so , gus , can you make vulcan do what i want it to ? you did n't answer me , pal . did you hear about that prison riot last week ? it seems they were complaining about rats in the cells ...	yeah , yeah , i can do it .
when ?	first question got to be `` where . ''
what ?	not `` what . '' do n't need a genius to figure out `` what . '' need a genius to figure out `` where . '' he says i 'm a genius , your don -- brother ! bubba ! your bubba ! see , if y'all do n't want them to trace it back , you got to punch this in from someplace nobody 'd ever think off . some little rinky- dink operation with a little mickey- mouse computer . ross it 's got to be someplace you can sneak into .
hey , boss .	just the man i wanted to see !
turn on the t.v .	i did . is n't it neat-o ?
uh ... what channel were you watching ?	what are you talking about , fella ?
it ai n't . it 's nowhere . it blew up . that 's how come they shipped the dude to earth when he was a baby . well . i know some stuff too , y'all .	wait a second . astronomers know where the planet used to be , right ? and you know what happens when a planet explodes ? debris . pieces floating in space .
just hold on a minute . i have been doin ' some thinkin '	god , that 's what i keep you for .
that 's what i been thinkin ' about . how you been keepin ' me . i ai n't getting ' nothing outta this gig .	gus , if there 's anything i hate , it 's greed .
he sure was n't actin ' bad and nasty that day in smallville . man , he was so full of niceness i was startin ' to feel funny about layin ' that chunk of ...	kryptonite !
every oil tanker and super- tanker and super-duper-tanker in the ocean is controlled . totally , by computers . computers to tell them where to go , how much oil to take on , where to deliver it .	they ai n't got captains ?
and do nothing . just sit there .	then how 's all the people gon na get their oil ?
and then shut down the pipe lines .	pumps stop pumping oil . pipe lines stop pipin ' oil . tankers stop deliverin ' oil . man , this is high stakes .
lookit , you 're getting ' what you want all the time . it ai n't right that i do n't get somethin ' ! i never get somethin ' !	i knew it , i knew it , go be nice to people and they think they can ask for the moon !
now ... when do i get a taste ?	i should think a taste of freedom is enough , do n't you ? or would you prefer jail ?
is this blackmail ?	do n't be getting ' racist with me , man .
is this whitemail ?	fair 's fair .
a waste-basket ? gus those are plans . blueprints .	for what ?
a computer .	we 've already got some .
not like this one you ai n't . nobody in the world got one like this 'cause it do n't exist yet . we got to build it .	you designed it ?
i invented it , man . in my head . it 's a stone killer-diller get-down get-it-on and twice-on-sunday super mutha computer .	what will it do ?
everything .	what will it get me ?
anything .	tell me more ...
yeah ? how 's it look ?	it looks wonderful . it is wonderful , let 's face it .
i told you it was n't no jive .	gus , it seems we are talking state-of-the-art technology here . we are talking unlimited power . we are talking `` get-down hot-cha daddy-o '' whatever you called it .
stone mutha .	exactly . stoned mother .
but a machine this powerful is going to make powerful enemies . people who will want to destroy it .	ai n't nobody gon na mess with my machine ! i 'll ... i 'll ... what will i do ? i 'll build in a counter-punch ! anything attacks it gets counter- attacked ! and wiped out !
can you do that ?	yeah , sure . ai n't nobody gon na stomp my electric train ...
remember , gus . a machine does n't want anything except to keep on being a machine . you 've got to make sure it can figure out how to beat any opponent .	man , all it got to do is find their weak spot . you bet on the machine in any fight you name , you gon na win your bet .
you want to mess with superman ?	ca n't wait , pal , ca n't wait .
awright . i got me my electric train , mama . i finally got -- hey , what y'all doin ' up there ? !	join the party , genius ! come on up !
how you doing down there ?	do n't make me talk , please . i got enough problems just hangin ' on .
hey , you 're perfectly safe .	i ai n't about to argue with you . what 's gon na happen to them three ? ross the boss and those ladies ?
that 's up to the judge , gus . it 's not your problem anymore .	watch out for them air pockets !
no , we 're just going down .	we gon na crash ?
i never crash , gus . that 'd be embarrassing .	we back in metropolis ?
whatcha wan na stop here for ? not that i ai n't glad to be on the ground , y'understand .	just a second .
thanks . let 's go	i was afraid you 'd say that . hey , is there a bus station around here ?
hey listen , i did n't know your mama was comin ' by ...	sister ! i 'm his sister !
through the telephone line terminal , that ai n't nothin ' .	oh bubba , think of the possibilities .
you will command the tankers to sail toward a 50-mile area in the middle of the atlantic ocean .	and do what ?
i know , by computers .	will you stop interrupting ? ! you will command the pumps to stop pumping .
who is she ?	her name 's lorelei ambrosia . she 's webster 's girl friday .
who 's the other woman ?	that 's his sister . vera webster .
you 're amazing , olsen . a boring banquet and you bring back 3,000 boring pictures . then superman puts out a fire on third avenue this morning and you stand there and watch the whole thing and you do n't take one picture ! !	i did n't have my camera with me .
all right , kent . i just hope you know what you 're doing . if you really think smallville is your big chance , go for it .	what about me ?
what about you ?	a story like this cries out for great human interest pictures . the big dance ! the homecoming game ! mr. kent posing next to his old locker !
why do i have to do this ?	you ! you 're lucky i did n't fire you . i get a chance at exclusive on-the-spot pictures of the biggest forest fire in history and what does he come back with ? ? ? a broken leg and twelve melted rolls of film .
ricky ? where ... what ...	i 'd wash that out with some iodine ... okay , mercurochrome .
thank ... you .	anytime .
oh . i 'm lana lang . this is ricky .	we 've already met .
and this is ... ... clark . my friend is around here somewhere , i 'll just look for ...	i 'm sorry , i 'm in a real hurry . see you around , pal .
you know , i really was n't expecting all this .	well ... i guess they did get a little carried away .
he was asleep before his head hit the pillow . well , this was only the biggest day of his life . i really do n't know how to thank you .	you just did , with that great dinner .
there 's no rush .	but the bridge ...
it 's hard to believe ... a great looking girl like you all alone like this . as she glances up at him , she is first flustered , then flattered , then ... finally ... just realistic :	listen , are you sure you should n't do something about the bridge ?
the picture looks blurry .	the picture 's fine . that 's the way she looks in real life .
what terrific story ?	kent 's been invited to his high-school class reunion .
hey , i 'd definitely shoot color on that one , jimmy . it 'd be a crime to just use black and white .	okay , kent , call your people and tell them the prodigal son is coming home . favoring clark -- happy now , he turns to leave the office . shot loses perry but we continue to hear his voice , o.s .
lois , i 've got to hand it to you . you 're amazing . who else could manage to turn a three-week tropical vacation into a front page story that 's going to blow the lid off government corruption in the caribbean ?	i just knew i was onto something when that taxi driver kidnapped me .
i thought you 'd never get here .	hey , do n't expect me to save you . because i do n't do that anymore .
well , do n't let me keep you from anything .	i 'm in no rush . so what do you have in mind ?
lots of things ...	tell me .
i 'll do more than tell you . i 'll show you , back at my place . if you 'll just do me one little favor first .	okay , what is it ? you want a ride ?
never . i get air-sick . you would n't like that .	no , i do n't think i would . so ... then what can i do for you ?
i do n't know you , lady .	but the other night ...
ross , honey , it 's time for your massage ...	bubba , does this woman have the right to burst in without knocking ... !
if you do n't mind , we are trying to hold a meeting here !	why do n't you hold your breath , instead ? maybe you 'll turn blue . on you that 'd be an improvement .
why stop at coffee ! a cup of coffee gets the world off to work in the morning , but what keeps the world working ?	diet soda ?
how would you know ?	hey , i know a lot of things !
`` at a special session of the general assembly , 178 countries voted to censure superman . with only columbia abstaining . '' ross that fella 's becoming a public menace .	and he use to be such a sweetie pie ! what 's wrong with him the last two weeks ?
i ca n't see anything .	turn on the light .
where 's the light switch ?	where do you usually find a light switch ?
come on , will you ? we 've got to get ready before he gets here .	gus ?
you ! activate circuits 29 through w7 and start full power coordinates on exterior defensive systems :	in other words , push this red button .
oh , superman !	cut the mush , lorelei . he 's after our skin !
i ca n't ! it 's out of control !	but how ? where 's it getting the power from ? ? ? !
mr. white , please , it 's time for you to draw this month 's winning jingo number . the prize is an all-expenses trip to south america .	why ca n't the idiot in circulation who dreamed up this imbecile contest in the first place -- -
53 .	53 !
okay ? goodbye .	you 've got to pick three more numbers .
mr. white , the next number , please ?	how 'm i supposed to turn this thing ?
by hand . like the pioneers did .	could n't we just get a computer to do this ?
mr. white , you be in this shot , handing them their plane tickets .	why do i have to do this ?
it 's modern . it 's up-to-date . it 's state-of-the art . people , i am in love with this machine . go ahead , mr. white .	where 's the handle ?
85,000 dollars .	missing ? ? ? ?
i do n't know who . whom . i ca n't trace it . in the old days it was simple . we kept books , we had ledgers , we could see what was going in and what was paid out . if somebody wanted to rob you , he 'd come in with a gun and say 'stick 'em up . '' now they get theses blasted computers to do their dirty work !	my friend , you are yesterday . whoever pulled this caper is tomorrow .
now , vera ... uh , simpson , you know my staff dietician ?	hello .
well , chum ? what now ? kiss the 85 thou goodbye ? pay some thief 's salary while he thinks up new ways to shake the money tree ?	he 's bound to slip up sooner or later .
that 's what i want to know ! by whom ? whom ? ? ? ?	get a hold of yourself , vera . nobody else ever will .
i do n't kiss .	oh , right . well then , just shake hands .
vulcan is the weather satellite our government put up in orbit to monitor the weather .	but if somebody re-programmed it , it could do much more .
it could make weather !	storms ! floods !
computers talk to other computers , right ?	somehow your twisted little mind should be able to figure out how to tap into the main computer at the aerospace center and reach vulcan .
she 's not his mama either .	gus gorman , this is my psychic nutritionist .
someplace where nobody knows him so they ca n't connect him with us .	well , webco has a hundred and twelve subsidiaries and every one of them is tied to our central computer system . how about ... hmmmm , someplace small ...
you mean ... you mean ... vera ! vera ! the magnitude of this ! ! !	today coffee -- --
small potatoes .	we already have a super-tanker .
chicken feed . if gus gorman can push the right buttons -- -	i could have it all ! holy cats ! all the oil ! all the tankers ! all the pumps ! the gosh-darn world will be out to lunch ! no heat , no gas -- sis , this is some nifty idea !
he ruined it ! that lousy do-gooder , he ruined it .	do n't cry , bubba .
nice try , butch , but it would n't be effective against superman . you 'll see ! now that he 's pulled this stunt , he 'll stick his nose in my oil scheme and ruin that one , too ! i 've got to get rid of him ! i 've got to !	how ? shoot him ? you know about him and bullets . not to mention knives , tanks , bombs ...
wait a minute ! she 's right ! kryptonite . i remember reading about it in an interview with him . nuts ...	what 's wrong ?
i just remembered the rest . there is n't any more . the only chunk that ever landed on earth disappeared a couple of years ago . it was in this story in the daily planet .	where did it come from ?
so ?	so all we 've got to do is pick up the garbage . we just have to find our where in heaven krypton used to be . then good old gus here contacts the vulcan satellite --
do n't you see ? okay , so you did n't kill him . nobody 's perfect . but that stuff we ran up in the lab was n't a complete failure after all . right after gus gave it to him , superman started to turn into a selfish , ornery , malicious , conniving ...	a normal person .
and now that superman 's out of the nice guy business ...	we can get to work on that oil !
that 's it ! the last tanker ! they 're all mine now ! all ...	not quite . what is that in the lower right hand corner ?
come on , let 's give it a dry run .	wait for gus to get here , sis .
he 's the only one who can operate this --	like fish he is . i know enough about computers to put a phd to shame . come now , brother dear , you did n't think i was going to let that little man run the show , did you ? gus gorman telling us what to do -- i 'd sooner kiss a pig !
he 's coming ! he 's going to hurt me !	do n't bet on it !
yes ! this time we got it right !	it 's your genius , pal ! you built a machine that can find anybody 's weak spot , just like you said .
jimmy , how 's the -	yeah . i 'll check .
anybody been hurt ?	so far the hostages are unharmed .
hostages ?	tourists , about twenty of 'em .
are you okay ?	she 'll be fine .
lois , i usually do .	then maybe you should get your glasses checked .
not everyone can have x-ray vision , you know .	do i detect a note of jealousy ?
lois , what are you doing ?	when was the last time you heard me sneeze ?
uh . . .	well , you never will again ! thanks to vitamin c ! i 'm reading a book that says the foundation of a sound body structure is one thousand milligrams of vitamin c every day .
one thousand ? ? that 's an awful lot of oranges . you know there are pill , lois . i 've seen them .	oh sure . the american answer to everything . pills . no , this is -- -- natural .
i do n't ?	of course not . not when you 've got so much going for you .
i do ?	sure ! but nobody knows it . least of all you . look , would you mind if i gave you some constructive criticism ?
actually , yes .	well , you should n't be more aggressive , clark ! trust your instinct ! when you see your opportunity , grab it ! i do .
lois , why do n't you at least get one of those automatic ones ?	have n't you heard ? there 's an energy crisis . no , this was good enough for my mother --
maybe i could try --	be my guest .
clark , everything i was saying -- ca n't you see i only say it because i really care ?	really ?
it is kinda romantic .	in july ? ? ?
'magic fingers . ' fifty cents .	hah , some guys say i have magic fingers .
yeah , thanks . . . . i mean , really ! posing as newlyweds to uncover the honeymoon racket in niagara falls . i mean , . imagine wasting a great reporter - -- uh , reporters -- on this . perry white and his sunday magazine exposes .	but this should be exposed . they get kids here who are just starting out in life and they take them for every nickel they can get . that 's what perry says .
a `` complimentary corsage . ''	oh sure , everything is complimentary . until you get the bill .
i was . . . uh . . . just wondering about the.. . .the.. . . the uh , arrangements . sleeping arrangements .	mr. smith - -- the `` complimentary couch . ''
i do n't know , they look pretty happy to me ...	that 's because you can hardly see through those things .
hey , are you hungry ? i 'm hungry .	lois , you 're amazing .
aw , c'mon -- anybody can get hungry .	no . i mean here you stand with one of nature 's most awesome spectacles and the whole time you 've had your back to it . are n't you impressed ?
where were you ?	i was getting hot dogs . what do you mean ?
i mean it strikes me funny that every time superman comes around , you disappear .	superman ? oh , was he here ?
lois , i do n't have the vaguest idea -- as usual -- what you 're --	do n't fake me out , clark . or whoever you are .
who ? ? ? ?	listen , i 've got to give you credit . your disguise is nearly perfect . i mean , if you fooled me , and i am nobody 's fool --
you 've been under a lot of pressure lately -	uh-uh . listen , i 'll tell you what . you say i 'm wrong . and i say i 'm right . so why do n't we make a little bet on it ?
because of what i 'm betting . my life .	what ? ?
oh clark , no !	lois , help ! i ca n't -- i ca n't swim -- !
it 's true . it 's true .	lois , i . . .
i was right . you are superman .	oh come on , that 's ridic -
you do n't have anything to be sorry about . how could i . . .	maybe you wanted to .
i did n't think i wanted to .	well , not in your mind , but maybe . . .deep in your heart . . .
i 'm in love with you . how do you feel ?	we 'd better talk .
i 'm listening .	not here , perry 'll be calling at six to find out what 's happening .
`` what 's happening . '' oh , is that the understatement of the year . well , so . . . where do you want to . . . talk ?	i guess it would be all right if - lois , now that you know me , i think you ought to know it all .
i want to .	let 's go to my place .
let 's go to my place .	your place ? maybe i should change , maybe you should , too .
you did it . you gave it all up for me . i . . . i do n't know what to say .	say you love me .
clark . . . it does n't matter . . . we can move . . .	do you . . . ah . . . want to step outside ?
blood . . . my . . . blood . . .	let 's get you inside . . . .
maybe we ought to hire a bodyguard from now on .	i do n't want a bodyguard . i want the man i fell in love with .
i have to go back . . .to the fortress . . .	but what can you do ? there 's no way now . . .
do n't . . . it 's not your fault . . . you did n't know . . .	he knew . i heard him . i just did n't listen .
hi .	oh , hi .
sleep well ?	never closed my eyes .
i know , i know all the arguments , you do n't have to tell me . that 's what i did all night -- i `` listened to the voices of reason '' till the dawn came up . do you have any idea what a vile sound it to hear the first bird singing when you 've been up night crying ?	i 'm sorry .
me too , oh , i tried to convince myself , believe me , `` it 's like being married to a doctor , '' i said . doctors are practically never at home . the get emergency calls in the middle of the night and their wives manage to live with it . then a voice said , `` could you be a doctor 's wife ? or are you too selfish . . . ``	you 're not selfish at all .
`` they ? ''	everybody . everybody else . i 'd be buying my little rainbow at the their expense . all the ones who say `` help . come quick . now '' i know who you 'd have to pick .
what else could i do ?	oh , i 'm not blaming you . i just know me . i 'd be jealous . jealous of . . . of all humanity . some rival , huh ?
lois , someday --	please do n't tell me `` you 'll find somebody else someday . '' cause . . . . . . well , you are a pretty hard act to follow , you 'll have to admit that . oh , i 'll get by , do n't worry about me .
see what happens when i do n't have my orange juice ? the human body is only a workable , fairly fragile machine when you treat it with the same respect you 'd show to -- -- . . . gee . . .	take it easy . take a deep breath .
. . . superman ? . . . . .	lois , i really do n't see why --
i 'll try to remember that . . .	well , you should . because i appreciate you , too , you know .
you do ?	sure . especially if you 'd be a really terrific guy and bring me a cheeseburger to go --
everything on it ?	everything on it .
get your head out of the clouds , kent . where you been the last twelve hours ?	uh ... home ...
do n't you watch television ? do n't you listen to the radio ?	actually i was trying to catch up on my reading . there 's a lot of dickens i never got around to --
but . . ..that 's terrible !	that 's why they call 'em terrorists . go down to the morgue and dig up anything you can find on past incidents of --
does lois know about this yet ?	does she know about it ? she 's in it !
what ? ?	the minute the story broke i bundled her on the first concord out of here . if paris goes kablooey i want the best reporter i 've got right there in the middle of it .
gee . but --	no offense , kent . you 're good , but lois is the best we 've got .
lex ... lex , how could you do that to otis ?	what else is ballast for ?
how would you like to take a little vacation ? i mean you 've earned it , you know ? you deserve it .	there is some good in you , lex , after all .
you 'll have to pack quickly .	a bikini ! i 'll need to buy a new bikini , lex . c'mon . after being cooped up in that prison , have n't you thought about me in a bikini . . ... once maybe ?
a parka .	you thought about me in a parka . that 's sick , lex . really .
mush ! mush !	look at this ! snow . ice . your idea of a good time .
a good time ! is that all you care about ? !	i would n't know . i 've never had one .
i like trees .	so does your average cocker spaniel . give me another one . under . . . the big one there .
you 'll miss the battle of the century !	good . my heart ca n't take it .
well done , miss teschmacher .	why am i doing this ? why am i here ?
this way lex .	it ' s fantastic ! -- -- - this place is genius .
genius ! -- lex .	i 'll be alright .
no , me , me , me . thank you .	it 's beautiful .
it has everything .	wrong .
why did n't you go before we left ?	that was two days ago . frankly , i think this place is a bit boring . it 's all white . why does n't the guy put up some posters ? maybe some bullfight things . . .
artemis ? do you read me ?	what 'd he say before ? he saw a girl ?
i think he said a `` curl . ''	what 's a curl ?
is n't that what the old canaveral guys used to call a comet on an east-west trajectory ?	how the hell would i know ? i was in high school back in those days .
mr. white , the pressroom wants to know how much longer to hold the front page .	give it another ten minutes . if we do n't -- hell , i 'll tell him . pete ? if we have n't got anything new in the next ten minutes just go with the wire service copy under the 40 pt . banner and run the picture for three columns . kent , i need a background story for the page 3 sidebar . give me every thing you know about this terrorist group .
a gang of terrorists seized the eiffel tower in paris	he knows where the eiffel tower is , olsen . you do , do n't you , kent ?
i ca n't understand it ! where is he ? i mean , he shows up every time a cat gets stuck in a tree , and now he decides to pull a disappearing act ?	maybe we just don ' t know his game plan .
game plan ! it 's fourth down and long yardage , the two-minute warning sounded and the ball 's deep in our territory ! how brilliant do you have to be ? !	superman 's got something up his sleeve , that 's for sure . we just have n't figured it out . is n't that right , miss lane ?
you no longer can serve humanity if you invest your time and emotion in one of them at the expense of the rest . surely this is not how you repay their gratitude , kal-el . could you really abandon the weak and the needy merely to fulfill some selfish dream .	selfish ! but they get a chance at happiness . ca n't i have that chance ?
you have been given a higher form of happiness . the happiness you feel by serving others , by inspiring them to --	yes , but it 's not all i feel .
patience , kal-el . you begin to sound like an earthling . superman mother , you speak only of honor , of sacrifice , of responsibility --	because that is your heritage . those are the values we lived by on krypton .
and she -- the one you have chosen -- she feels as much for you ?	yes .
-- as the keeper of the archives of krypton , it falls to me to tell you of the darkest episode in our planets history .	now this i want to hear .
for many eons the peoples of our world have lived together in harmony . then there appeared among us three anti-social elements - what on earth are classified as `` criminals . ''	my kind of people .
the three proved - after exhaustive efforts - incapable of rehabilitation . now as you know , we had no death penalty -	sensible enough .
and so our scientists constructed , from an irreversible mathematical equation , the phantom zone . in it we imprisoned these three arch-villains for all eternity .	no possibility for parole ?
the elders have , of course , thought long and hard about that question .	i asked the right question .
the one danger we have considered is that the phantom zone might - we can not predict - just might be cracked by a nuclear explosion in space . i can not say i am glad you asked me that -	i did n't ask her anything . . .
do n't feel bad , mr. luthor . it almost worked . i mean california almost threw up right in the ocean . millions of people almost killed . if it had n't been for that guy superman - that overgrown boyscout ...	i want my liberace record back tonight .
delete in cutting	i mean they ca n't even trace that guy on that radar they got , every time they try he just flies off .
where ?	north .
why ?	to ski ?
otis , your brain defies any known scientific laws in its infinite capacity to deteriorate . every man has a vulnerable point . some like you otis , have more that one . i did n't see superman 's in time . but now through patience , invention and skill , my black box is just about ready .	oh ! that black box in our cell ?
shhhhhhh !	that little black box , mr. luthor , i mean -- what 's it for ?
that little black box goes beyond any known conventional radar , it tracks alpha waves .	ahhhhhh -- alpha waves .
wait , wait , wait just a moment . wait till you 've got to know better will you please . wait , -- look , i can give you anything you want . i can give you the brass ring , the - er -- unlimited freedom to maim , cure , destroy , chew - plus lex luthor 's savvy . lex luthor 's career guidance ... lex luthor 's school of ...	we have all of this without you . you can not bargain with what you do n't have .
no , jor-el , the baseball player that came from porto rico . yes jor-el your jailer .	the son of jor-el on this planet ?
oh my fullness , as i explained to you before , i am about the best there is . second best there is .	revenge ! we will kill the son of our jailer !
he flies as well , then . . .	constantly .
he has powers as we do . . .	certainly . but - er . oh magnificent one , he 's just one , but you are three , or four even , if you count him twice .
oh , general , the world is a big place . thank goodness , my needs are small ... as it turns out , i have this affinity for beachfront property . . .	what do you want ?
superman ! the --	really lois , we 've got to stop meeting this --
you must be freezing .	i must be . but i 'm not . your home . this is your home .
so -- i hope you like it .	like it ? it 's magnificent ! not that it could n't use a woman 's touch . especially around dinner time .
i never did this before . . . i have to tell you .	hey , do n't worry . you 'll be fine , just . . . well , do n't rush it .
it must be tough , having to be clark kent .	oh no . i really like it sometimes . and if it were n't for him , i would n't have met you .
perhaps there is some good in you after all , lex luthor .	me ? i 'm loaded with good ! i mean i 've never even used it .
wait ! do n't go in ! it 's a trap !	luthor , you poisonous snake . . .
i knew you 'd double-cross me , luthor . a lying weasel like you could n't resist the chance . . .	are you kidding ? i knew it all the time . did you see how they fell into our trap ? beautiful . . .
too late , luthor . too late . . .	listen . have i got a proposition for you , superman . i mean i owe you one , you know ? now do n't say yes or no till you hear me out . . .
which one would you like to join , luthor ? pick a hole .	wait a minute , wait a minute , let 's talk a deal , superman . we can take a lunch on this --
you said it . three-to-one should get you both ears and the tail .	he ran in fear from us . . .
why do you say this to me when you know i will kill you for it ?	kill me ? lex luthor ? extinguish the greatest criminal flame of our age ? eradicate the only man on earth . . .
there is something more you want . the greed is written on your face .	perhaps a small . . . incentive , your ultimate . a tiny bauble to help me jog my memory . . .
what more ?	cuba .
no drinks . no movie . this is the last time i take a charter flight .	where is his home , lex luthor ? which way ?
put down lex luthor !	put down lex luthor ?
hey , let 's be fair . actually , there 've been two or three times --	now i shall have the son of jor-el as my slave ! forever . if not , the millions of earthlings you protect will pay for your defiance . beginning with this one .
i 'm the man they 're protecting . i 'm the president . i 'll kneel before you if it will save lives .	it will . starting with your own .
who is this imbecile ? where is he ?	i wish i knew . -- oh , god .
who is this . . . superman ?	you 'll find out , general ! and when you do . . .
and now they are willing to release the rest of the hostages ?	in return for a guarantee that we will not launch an attack an them .
there will be no attack ? no attempt to overpower the terrorists ?	um . . . .we have made this guarantee .
yes , but will you honor it ?	we have not the choice to refuse , have we , if we believe it is a real hydrogen bomb that they have .
free !	free !
strange . i tore those metal fibers like paper . and what he did . . .. was amazing ! something is happening . . ..	yes . to all of us . the closer we come to an atmosphere with only one sun - a yellow sun - the more our molecular density gives us unlimited powers !
then we must go there too . to rule . finally - to rule ! and then you shall have what you want .	delete in cutting
so this is the planet houston . . .	what shall we do now ?
look , they need a machine to fly .	brave young heroes . be nice to them , my dear . blow them a kiss .
you are master of all you survey .	and so i was yesterday . and the day before .
this `` super '' man is nothing of the kind . i have discovered his weakness .	yes ?
he ... cares . he actually cares about these . . . . . .these people . these earth people .	sentimental idiot .
he 's captured non !	do n't worry . i will draw his fire . with a few of my own .
general -- - ?	we must combine our strength .
did you really believe we would give up our advantage ?	`` super-sucker . `` for once , lex luthor was right .
it 's brilliant . daddy thinks so , too . you 'll write a new series -- 'metropolis after hours . '	i really do n't think . . .
but you 're perfect for it . you 're young , you 're single , you 're successful ...	and i 'm usually in bed by ten-thirty .
they make my eyes itch .	do n't worry . i wo n't make you do it alone . i know all the right places . i 'm a member at all the right clubs . . . we 'll start tonight at the grand opening of the metro club ! it 's a date !
you 're late . very late .	gosh , i 'm sorry , we better get in line .
i 've never been in a place like this before .	this is metropolis after hours ! this is what you 'll be writing about . c'mon , let 's dance .
do n't tell me . you learned to dance at church socials .	actually , i had a crash course from my mother the night before my prom .
my prom was so boring . we all flew to paris the next day to recover . . . sometimes my whole life seems boring . i thing maybe i should just give everything away and go live among the poor people . then i remember how smashing i look in sable . . . oh , it 's all so confusing . you think i 'm silly , do n't you ?	no ... metropolis is a confusing place . back in smallville -- my hometown -- everything was more simple . people would sacrifice everything just to lend a helping hand .
oh . . . no , there 's no one back home .	what about here ?
well , my career takes up a lot of my time .	do n't tell me you 're waiting for lightning to strike . wide-eyed romantics are an endangered species .
that sounds kind of pessimistic .	no , realistic . there 's no magic in the world . girls just do n't get swept off their feet anymore .
i feel kind of light-headed . . .	do n't worry , i 've got you .
maybe i should sit this one out .	do n't give up . this is a perfect subject for your series on young metropolis . now let 's get those knees up !
now you try , clark . we 'll start you off with 60 pounds .	if you say so . here goes .
he 's a jerk . i never noticed it before . seems like a lot of people i know are jerks . . . . . . maybe you think the same thing about me . that 's why you keep avoiding me .	i 'm not avoiding you . i 've been very busy and . . . i like you . . . i really do .
then prove it . lois is doing an interview with superman about his peace mission . . .	yes , i know . i 'm sure it will be a great story .
gee , i do n't think . . .	come early . the view is so romantic from my balcony .
hello , lacy . can anybody break a twenty ? the cabbie did n't have any change .	. . . let me get my purse .
should n't you pay the cabbie ?	oh . . . right . . . i 'll be back in a flash .
i missed you . it was n't any fun up there with just lois and superman . they 're so boring . let 's go do something wild !	but they 're expecting us . it would n't be polite .
oh . . . my . . .	clark . . . !
hi . is dinner ready ? i 'm famished .	let 's sit down . they walk to the table . lois calls out to the balcony .
gee , i 'm really sorry .	no mind , it 's only antique irish linen .
daddy 's offered me jobs at some of his other companies . but , i 've been thinking maybe i 'll take some time off . i 'm going to find a place like smallville , in the country . maybe a farm . . . see what the slow lane is like .	i 'm sorry to see you go .
you do n't have to be polite , clark . i 've got a pretty good idea of how you feel about me .	i 'm not so sure you do .
any more like you back home , clark ?	like me ?
you 'll find a good man lacy . you deserve one .	maybe if you 'd have met who i am now , instead of the spoiled brat you met a few weeks ago , it would have been different between us .
regardez . voila monsieur david warfield .	that tycoon who owns all those sleazy tabloids ?
no paris ?	i do n't think we 're being treated fairly , lois . and i 'm going to tell miss warfield .
the president is about to speak . i do n't think it 's going to be good news .	you always overreact , clark . how terrible can it be ?
oh , probably just a picture request . i 'll take care of it if you want , lois .	i do n't think 'fan mail ' fits this letter . read it , clark .
'are you or are you not part of a plot to weaken our national defense ? '	it 's her father 's grey matter that 's weakened if you ask me . how can i ask superman such a dumb question .
. . . please leave your message at the beep .	clark , it 's lois . this is the fourth message . i 've left . . . where are you ?
it 's just a bad flu , really . how did you know . . .	you have n't been at work . . . you did n't call the office . . . you did n't even call me . how could you not call back ?
superman ? has something happened to him ?	everyone 's saying he 's . . . dead . but i know that is n't true . i feel it in my heart . i think he just needs help .
it must have been a super effort to get out of bed , clark .	well , i 'm feeling a lot better . . . almost chipper . . . . . . and all because i had a visit from a very good nurse .
close the curtains . the sun is hurting my eyes .	of course it is . do you know what the sun is ? why it 's just one huge nuclear bomb . a bomb with enough radiation to incinerate an average man like . . . that .
but superman is n't an average man .	and what am i ? a shriner ? no , if you 'll join forces with me , together we can make the world safe for war profits again .
boys , old lex has a secret recipe in this dish . . . call it a genetic stew . you help me place it on one of your missiles and i promise you . . . if superman throws it into the sun , he 'll get the biggest surprise of his life . i 'll be able to introduce superman to his first nightmare . . . a nuclear man !	and this so-called . . . nuclear man . . . of yours can defeat superman ?
and what do we get out of it ?	if my plan works , gentlemen , i 'll just take a tiny commission . . . something . . .appropriate . . . a number with a lot of zeros after it .
lex , we all appreciate how you 've supported us lately and . . . uh . . . in recognition of your hard work we 've decided to increase your commission to 12 percent .	gee guys , that 's swell of you . but . . . i 've got another idea .
impossible ? why ?	because i made a vow . never to interfere in the destiny of your planet .
but what good is a vow if everything gets blown away ? what good was my letter ?	i 'm going to pass this letter on to all the leaders of the world . i promise you . for it is they , and not i , that represent the people of earth .
well , i do n't understand .	i 'm sorry .
would you mind taking a walk with me ?	absolutely !
would you mind waiting for me in the visitor 's gallery ?	n-no ... i mean ... you bet .
awesome !	jeremy , i need you to tell the people of the world what you see .
well . . . i see the ocean currents . . . and the rain . . . and mountains and rivers . . . but . . .	go on . . .
but you ca n't tell where one country begins and another ends . you ca n't see any borders . it 's just . . . one world .	good . if you can see it , and i can see it , maybe some day everyone will see it .
not so fast ! all trips are canceled . we pay for wire services . and what we do n't get from them , we 'll invent .	mr. white , come with me i want to see
who does clark kent think he is anyway ! he never even said good night !	clark kent ! you socialized with him . . . a . . . reporter !
oh . . . no . . . i mean , we just went dancing . . . for a story . . .	your grandfather had one iron rule that 's stood me well . never fraternize with the help . keep too your own station . am i clear ?
darling , it 's good riddance . let her go . and while you 're at it , fire that clark kent . he has n't been here in days . he has n't even called .	i know daddy . i 'm worried about him .
did n't we have our little talk about personal involvement with the help ? now that you 're the publisher . . .	daddy . . . ?
yes , darling ?	stuff it .
tone down our headlines ? lacy , that 's all the common man reads !	i 'd just like to have a little less sensationalism .
no , daddy . our business is journalism . we ca n't continue to be so irresponsible . . . or else we 'll just lead everyone into a disaster .	do n't be over-dramatic , young lady . what kind of disaster could we help bring about ?
is he for real ?	one hundred percent . and i like him that way .
i think he 's kind of cute .	forget it , princess . clark is the world 's oldest boy scout trustworthy , loyal , obedient , helpful ... and i do n't remember the rest , but he 's them too . and i promise , he 's not interested in anyone like you .
but all men like me , lois . i 'm very rich .	. . . and very nave !
this letter was addressed to superman care of me .	superman gets mail here ?
i think there 's an angle .	an angle ?
i know i 'm not exactly a girl scout but . . . maybe if i show him i 'm trying . . . he 'll like me .	who ?
clark . he 's late again . i ca n't figure him out .	that 's because there 's nothing to figure out . now will you please pay attention . i 'm not through insulting your father .
and your heart beats faster just thinking about him .	right . . . you want to tell him how you feel . . .
but he 's never there .	why , lois , i did n't know . . . who is he ?
what 's he going to say ?	something . . . wonderful .
what 's that ?	our other dinner guest .
where 's clark ?	he was getting on . . . and then this man with luggage and . . . oh , it 's a long story .
are we going to skip the country , uncle lex ?	lenny , , you pathetic product of the public school system . your uncle lex has had only one thing on his awesome mind during his incarceration . . . destroying superman !
do you realize what i can create with a single strand of superman 's hair !	a toupee that flies ?
. . . i look at you , lenny , and i know how the romans felt when the barbarians arrived at their city gate .	but why the hair ?
he missed the door , uncle lex .	quiet ! you 'll make him self-conscious .
whoa . . .	he has all of superman 's powers . if i 've planned it right . . .
gee , uncle lex , i do n't think this guy 's much of a dancer .	let 's try to keep your i.q . a family secret , leonard . before we launch him against superman , we have to test him ... see how well he does with mayhem and destruction . kind of a coming out party under the glare of media covering the metro club gala . and once he proves himself , then . . .
superman broke your monster , uncle lex .	i must have miscalculated . how . . .
gee , uncle lex , i was just getting to the good part .	get the box , nephew .
hey , uncle lex , how 's the nuclear guy goin ' to find his way here ?	oh leonard . . . when i sent the remains of my last experiment . . .
the one superman wrecked up ?	not how i might have put it , but , correct . the remains i sent to the sun included the creatures genetic memory . he 'll remember everything that he experienced . not to worry . he 'll find his way back to me . did you hear that ?
you 're spookin ' me out , uncle lex .	there !
hey ! he looks . . . normal .	he 's . . . beautiful . perfect .
hey ! just remember i made you .	you 're just an experiment , freako !
what was that about ?	did n't you see it ? he lifted me up and crashed me down .
he 's . . . cold . . .	good . let 's hope he stays that way .
of course ! that 's his one vulnerability . the one way he can be stopped .	what ?
boy , are you gon na get it .	my nephew , leonard . he worships me . let 's share a toast to you . . . a nice guy who 's about to finish last .
we 'll all fry .	this was n't in the plan .
do n't worry honey , i 'm sure he 'll make a swell husband .	ready , uncle lex ?
you think he 'll find us .	never . but we have to hide out for a while . lay low . say . . . a couple of years . by then i 'll have a new plan .
what i need this for ?	for dignity . my reputation is at stake . just put it on .
i had n't counted on this but . . . . . . of course - the power of the sun has given him internally generated heat . i am a ...	you are . . .
what ? a genius ? . . . an inspiration ?	you are . . . nothing . i am father now .
i am an experiment ? i am freako ?	i made you , and i can destroy you .
destroy superman !	wait ! not yet ! back !
nifty , huh ? goodnight sweet prince , parting is . . . inevitable now , destroy superman .	first , i have fun .
nice bit . you 're good . with my brain and your , well , frankly , brawn , the possibilities are staggering . i could be . . . emperor , king ! did you see how scared those guys were ?	what do you fear ?
me ? now ? with superman dead and you on my team ? it 's like i 'm the coach and you 're the best power forward ever . what could i have to fear ?	destiny .
stop ! i command you . . . you mutant !	i am master now .
guess who ? it 's your old friend , lex .	luthor , i suspect if you had actually planted a bomb you 'd be far away from here by now .
if you have any social skills , you 've learned them from a rattlesnake . just what are you up to ?	know something ? you 're a workaholic . a good guy 24 hours a day . stop and smell the roses sometime . take up a hobby . get a pet . . . a kitten or a puppy . . .
it 's common knowledge you hate children and animals . why are you back in metropolis ?	why ? because i want to be the first one to introduce you to a new kid on the block .
look closely at his cell structure . see anything familiar ?	you 've broken all the laws of man , luthor . and now you 've broken the laws of nature ! . . . i assume you must have hidden a device in one of the missiles i hurled into the sun !
your time in prison has twisted you into a delusionary state , luthor .	no , no , listen . i escaped with only one thing on my mind . . . the end of superman .
i 'm not going anywhere .	i 'll ignore that . . . so , i created a monster who did n't work nearly as well as i might have liked -- you were clearly his better -- he needed more energy , more power .
which explains why you sent his organic matter to the sun .	precisely . and then it came to me . my greatest ever plan . i made a deal with some minor league bad boys . arms dealers , renegades generals , you know the type . with you gone , we 'll make a fortune rearming the world .
you 'd risk worldwide nuclear war for your own personal financial gains .	nobody wants war . i 'd just like to keep the threat alive .
superman . . . but you 're ... dead !	still having delusions , lex luthor ?
i 'll deal with you later .	right , good . tell you what , we 'll wait right here . till you get back .
but . . . how could you beat him ?	high school physics , luthor . while i was recuperating i had time to figure out that if your foul creature was born from the sun , it must have been his source of energy .
but . . . but is n't the world about to be osterized ?	no . . . it 's the way it always is . . . on the brink . . . with good fighting evil .
i know , but --	stop saying you know when i say 'y'know . ' i know you know . yes , i know you 're here , otis . what do you want , a brass band ?
you 'll be designing monuments soon , albert ! hotels ! palaces !	bunkers !
there 's some slice american cheese ... and ... a half a bottle of club soda , i think .	wonderful . otis will go above and steal some big macs .
ahhhh , my favorite part of the day . who else could have thought of this aquarium ?	nobody else .
that the planet blew up on may 23 , 1937. that the rocket ship with the revolting little freak in it took three years to reach earth . ergo ?	he 's thirty-five years old .
you 're a great architect , albert .	thank you .
ah ! the guest of honor at last ! and about time , too !	we 're running out of smoke .
but mr. luthor , sir , i already --	and stop interrupting . his is the big scene . your finest hour ! you rose to the challenge , baby ! and you lost . that 's the best part !
it 's very simple , otis . very simple , the xk101 rocket . it 's nothing , forty years ago we in the fatherland were working on this . five more years , we would 've had it . but then -- -- that silly war ... why , my cousin werner had already --	albert !
yes , so , well , werner would 've gotten to that too but -- -- but the xk101 flies only eight feet above the ground ... well below the radar limit ! so what ? we could have done that soon . we had ways to make people ta -- ways to avoid the radar . and this xk101 -- they think it 's so smart that they keep it in 'missile silos ' underground . hah ! we kept many things underground .	one of them should 've been you .
yes , mr. luthor . the xk101 can travel anywhere in the world undetected . it also has a sensory device built into it so that it can detect any obstacle in its path and avoid it . it just goes around it or over it . the xk101 never quits ! it will not stop until it reaches its pre-targeted target !	got it ? otis ?
me ?	not you . you . tell me again .
you 'd better get a new alarm clock . the chief has been hollering for you .	i 've been on the job .
a hot story , huh ?	it was hot , yes .
you and lois , you get all the action . there she is , out in the wild west and everything .	lois is n't here ?
she 's in california . that 's wild enough , i guess .	what 's she doing in california ?
clark ... son ... that ... thing you did with the sheriff today ... those ... stunts ... you do n't do those things at school , do you ?	no , mom . you know i would n't break my promise .
do n't worry , mom . i know .	anyway , we kent 's do n't like showoffs , ai n't that so ? a body 's got to be humble even if he knows that he 's better'n his neighbors .
mom ...	i know .
i talked to ben hubbard this morning . he 'll be more than glad to bring in the crops on shares .	he 's a good man , ben is . your father always said so .
mother ...	i know son , i know ...
do you know where you 're headed ?	north . it 's north
keep warm now .	i will .
i 'd like to .	well !
i 'll bet you have some good ideas .	hey , you 're getting a better class of people in your office these days , boss .
your bookie ?	no .
i know . he sends a check every week to his dear gray-haired old mother .	actually , she 's silver-haired .
not ... gray .	not really , no .
are there any more at home like you ?	not really , no .
well , how are you enjoying your first day on the job ?	i think i lost a week 's salary at the dart board .
some people are n't the athletic type .	but otherwise it 's swell .
see ? did n't i tell you this was a tough town ?	unbelievable .
hey !	what the -- !
stop him , clark !	he may have a gun !
it is n't worth getting a heart attack over , lois .	you 're great with the advice , clark . maybe you 'd better take over the lovelorn column .
know what ?	you described the exact contents of my purse .
what now , my love ?	huh ?
big night coming up ?	oh , not really . i guess i 'll just watch a little tv and -- -- unless ... would you be interested in dinner ?
thanks , clark , but i 'm booked for the night .	oh .
it 's not what you think . darn it . i 'm going out on a story . the secretary of defense is landing at the airport tonight and this kid 's going to be there to make sure he answers a few questions he 'd rather duck .	do n't you ever give up ?
for what ? oh , i 've see the way the other half lives . my sister , for instance . it looks terrific , but is that what i really want ? three kids , two cats , and fifteen needlepoint pillows ? i 'd go bananas after one week . hell , i need this crazy existence of mine . like i need the plague , right ? that 's what your thinking .	no . i 'm just thinking that you smoke too much , if you do n't mind my saying so .
there 's no real proof that tobacco --	lois , you should see what the inside of your lungs look like .
can i take you to the airport ?	not unless you can fly .
i 'm telling you , i was there .	you were probably so scared you did n't look to see what the trick was .
it was n't a trick !	oh sure . a man flies in the sky like a pigeon and it was n't a trick .
clark kent , if you had only seen it the way i did , you -	it was done with wires . they must have rigged him like they do with peter pan .
there were n't any wires . i looked .	mirrors , then . it 's done with mirrors .
he grabbed me ! he held me ! he set me down gently ! how could that be done with mirrors ?	look , there was probably a trampoline on the roof somewhere and this joker just took a big bounce .
why would he do that ? how would he know i was going to suddenly slip .	i do n't know , lois , but i do know a fraud when i hear one . this thing goes against all natural laws .
you 're just jealous .	jealous ? of what ?
what 'd you call him ?	superman . pretty good name for him , is n't it ?
is that what they 're calling him ?	they will once i hang it on him in tomorrow 's edition .
super ... man . hmmm ...	it is n't that i still do n't like you , clark . it 's just that ... well , once you 've had something like that happen to you , it kind of changes a girl . i 'm going to make some coffee . you want some ?
oh , what a chance ! if i could just -- get to him .	you 're not the only one .
listen ... thank you .	you too . i just ... i ca n't get it on for good guys . y'know ?
you ! the girl from the volcano ! kryptonite ...	help ! i mean -- i ca n't stop saying it . silly , is n't it - there 's nothing to worry about . help ! see .
what are you doing here ?	screaming
besides that .	he wants to see you . lex luthor .
the bald man ! the one who tried to kill me ?	the way you describe him does n't really do him justice .
could n't we forget the plane ? you could lift me in your big strong arms ?	sure , and let the plane crash in the middle of the city .
oh .	look , lady , you saved my life once . i owe you a favor . but i ca n't understand why you follow a man like that .
what can i tell you ? he 's my leader .	okay . take me to your leader .
you and your real estate .	me and my real estate ? how many other girls , miss teschmacher , are lucky enough to have a park avenue address like this ?
it is n't a park avenue address . really .	so it 's six hundred feet below park avenue , it 's still a park avenue address .
why does it all mean so much to you ? all the time , 'land , land , land . '	my father always said to me , 'son , do n't invest your money in anything but land . land ! stocks rise and fall , banks fall , people are no damn good , but they 'll always need land and for that they 'll pay through the nose . 'remember that , ' my father said . 'land . ''
your father was a sick weirdo .	i know that . bu tin this case he was right . arnold 'buster ' luthor , the most inept check forger of his time -- a pity he did n't live to see his son strike out for the big city . a pity he did n't live to see how , from humble beginnings , i created an empire .
this ? ?	compared to what came before ? a year of living in the sewers ? a part of that will always be with me .
so i 've noticed .	criers and complainers ! that 's what i get ! moaners and groaners ! me , lex luthor , who figured out how to live in luxury without ever paying one cent in taxes . lex luthor , who built this fantastic kingdom under the sea , so to speak , hidden and undetected by the fools who eke out their miserable lives on the streets above .
streets , sunlight . when was the last time i saw sunlight .	you 'll be seeing stars in a minute , miss teschmacher . y'know ?
speaking of feeding things , what about dinner ?	what about dinner ? i have to worry about the crime of the century , that 's all . y'know ? am i supposed to worry about what 's in the refrigerator , too ? what 's in it ?
again ? ? ?	first the pets , otis .
i needed this , y'know ? i really needed this . just when i 'm nearing the fruition of my project , big bird flies into town . go ahead ! kill me by inches ! put me on the agony rack !	you think he 's for real ?
nuts . he made it .	tough guy , huh ?
bet he makes it .	you 're on .
shut up .	i did n't say a word .
damn ! this will get him .	place your bets , ladies and gentlemen. ,
what 's the temperature now ?	fifty degrees below and still falling .
krypton !	krypton ? the place where superman comes from ?
some people can read 'war and peace ' and come away thinking it was a simple adventure story . other people can read the ingredients on a chewing gum wrapper and come away with the secret of the universe . y'know .	i read the article .
see ?	see ? i see . it 's you who do n't see . does n't see . i can not believe it ! how you people fail to grasp the long-range significance of this ! y'know ?
i 'm going to bed .	stay and listen ! besides , it 's twelve in the afternoon . this is no time to go to bed .
mr. romance ...	deductive reasoning , my friends ! that 's the name of the game . what does it say here ?
meteorites !	bingo !
ahh . 'national geographic . '' in my day , this made 'playboy '' look like mother goose .	i do n't mean to denigrate your misspent youth , lex , but what does that rock have to do with --
tune me in , lady . an explosion such as the one superman describes would have altered the molecular structure of the krypton rock .	i know i 'm going to get rapped in the mouth for saying this , but so what ?
breathe that air , miss teschmacher .	i will as soon as i get the sand out of my nose .
you 're happy , are n't you ?	la de da da ...
the door jam , miss teschmacher . this ethiopian shmendrick here , in his simple , unconscious way , needed something to wedge the door open , the better to inhale the flies that form such an important part of his diet . so he grabs something from the table ...	we just take it ?
what do you suggest , my dear ?	the least we can do is leave him another door jam .
about vesuvius . about superman writhing in the bowels of the volcano . ahh , the look on his face when he saw that kryptonite . when will i see another , y'know ? y'know ?	i do n't like to talk about it , lex .
weak sister . i still ca n't figure out why it took so long for you to catch up with us after we all ran out . y'know ?	you ever try to run in high heels ? you probably did .
ready ?	ready .
they stop for nothing .	but if i put my leg out like claudette clobert in --
do n't let me down .	you ? ! how about me ?
no news is not good news . y'know	there was a recipe on the back --
you 're not going to hit me ?	hit you ? a clever girl like you ? 'he turned slowly , slowly in the lava ... ' was how you described it . now that 's clever . i have to hand it to you .
you 've been under such a strain . and i 've ... i 've -- -- neglected you . mea culpa ! y'know .	i know ...
she knows . clever , very clever . and unappreciated . but i 'm going to take you away from all this .	a night on the town instead of under it ?
i do n't understand .	yours not to reason why , miss teschmacher . relax ! enjoy it ! just look at that smog !
this all has something to do with superman , does n't it ?	your volcano chum ? your junior life-saving buddy ? let 's get high .
oh . why ? does he live up here ?	not exactly . but it 's his kind of neighborhood .
nothing , nothing . i just want to invite him to tea .	tea ?
you got wax in your ears ?	what if he does n't show up ? what if he 's taking a nap ?
danger ? ? somebody ? ? ? lex -- where are you going ?	lex is going bye-bye .
where 's mine ? ! where 's my parachute ?	miss teschmacher , superman is a fairly bright individual . my understanding of the way he works is that he wo n't be fooled by a simple trick .
good . fine . now where 's my parachute ?	i 'm wearing it .
i mean the other one !	what other one ?
you ca n't do this to me !	of course i can . i love you .
but you ca n't ignore these facts ! it 's suicide ! worse than that , it 's genocide .	jor-el , be warned . this tone of yours approaches insolence .
my friends , i am not a rash , impulsive person . i 'm not given to wild , unsupported statements . we must evacuate this planet immediately !	you are one of krypton 's greatest scientists jor-el -
then -	but so is vond-el
i have sworn to uphold the laws of krypton .	this discussion is terminated . the decision of the council is final . you will cease pursuing this matter . any attempt by you to continue , to create a climate of fear and panic among the populace , will be deemed an act of insurrection !
as an irredeemable criminal ? you compare me to them ?	if you persist , you leave us no choice .
will you abide by the council 's opinion ?	neither my wife nor i will attempt to leave krypton .
what 're you writing , lois ?	an ode to spring . are there one or two `` t 's '' in bloodletting ?
two .	'and the people on the street , the little man who runs the corner newsstand , the old lady sunning herself on the stoop the kids playing stick ball -- none of them will ever forget the night of senseless bloodletting that turned a friendly block part into a nightmare . '
boy !	gets you where you live , huh ?
how come you get all the good stories , lois ?	it 's because i 'm an intrepid girl reporter , jimmy . besides , the chief of detectives has the hots for me .
need i ask who 's favored to collect at the end of this week .	on the salary he pays me , i ca n't make my rent without it .
it 's a ... baby .	what 's your name , boy ?
well - got ta change that tire if were gon na get home .	all of us .
the good lord works in mysterious ways .	he sure as heck does that .
all these years , happy as we 've been , how i prayed and prayed he 'd see fit to give us a child . and just when i finally accepted my bitter lot ... no one must ever know .	folks 'll ask question .
we 'll say he 's a child to my cousin in north dakota , and just now orphaned . poor thing .	guess i 'd better hitch up the rig and come back to get that ... that thing he was settin ' in . what do you make of that thing ? martha ? you listening ?
i was thinkin ' what to call him . i was thinkin ' i had an uncle who was a fine man , you recall him ? the church sexton	who ? clark ? i never cared two hoots for that fella . jonathan jr. that 's got a ring to it .
got all a 's this year . teacher said he 's the best 5th grader in the -	do n't brag now , jonathan .
oh , dear . that is n't what i --	what your mother means , clark , is that she do n't want folks to think you 're special .
it 's the only logical conclusion . if he remains here , he 'll be as dead as ...	-- as we will be .
lara , please ...	but why earth , jor-el . they 're practically animals .
they are primitive , lara , but they are not animals .	a million years behind us . jor-el , he 's only a baby .
their atmosphere will sustain him . he will look like one of them .	he 'll be weightless .
yes , true . but on other worlds there would be other problems - heat , cold , no life , no life support systems ... no , lara , believe me ; earth is the least of evils . on earth , his lighter gravity will render him almost weightless - that ca n't be helped . but with his denser molecular structure , he will also be strong . he will be fast , he will be virtually invulnerable .	he will be odd , different .
you 've been doing some research in the archives .	i want to know what my child is going to face .
i do n't know what to say . look , i -- i just -	enjoyed it ?
i guess i got carried away	my son , i foresaw this . i knew -
no ! you could n't imagine -	how good it felt !
... .to feel yourself . very well . you are revealed to the world . but still you must keep your secret identity . first of all , you will need it as an escape valve . you can not be special twenty-eight hours a day -	twenty-four .
or twenty-four as it is in earth time . furthermore , if you will reveal yourself , your enemies will have a way of getting at you where you are vulnerable : by hurting the people you care for . ah , this earth ... this world you live in , kal-el ... resist its temptations , its rewards , especially its political system .	there are none of them any good anyway .
here 's the story on that east 19th street murder spree . page one with a banner headline seems about right to me .	it does , huh ? clark kent , i 'd like you to meet lois lane .
lois , take kent there and introduce him around	okay , but ... why ? no offense .
lois , the kickback story ...	nine to five it 's a pulitzer prize , i know .
if one of you can get that -- i mean , i want the real superman . who is he ? where 's he from ? what 's his favorite ball team ? what 's up ?	he is . usually .
easy now , miss , i 've got you ? ? ?	you 've got me ? who 's got you ? ? ?
do as i say . let go !	oh , god ! i 'm going to die !
who ... who ...	let 's just say i 'm a friend . and watch yourself from now on with those things , okay ? i mean if the good lord wanted people to fly he would have given them wings .
with my luck , now it 'll rain .	not a chance . it 's too nice a night .
superman ? ? ?	right on the first guess .
wha ' ... what are you doing here ?	i came to talk to you .
the answer is yes . now what 's the question ?	there 's been a lot of confusion in the media about who i am and what i 'm up to and all that . i 'd like to set the record straight . with your help .
this is incredible . i was just sitting here trying to figure out how to contact you . i mean , you do n't have an answering service , right ?	unlisted number , shall we proceed ?
well ... flashlight ?	i think you 'll be able to remember it . i doubt you 'll misquote me .
if i do , you can punish me . fly me to bermuda and just lave me there for two weeks . this is fantastic ! i wish clark were here .	who 's clark ? one of your colleagues ?
oh , i 've got to get some matches . my cigarette .	i 'd appreciate it if you did n't smoke .
oh . well , where do we start ?	ask , you 're the girl reporter .
okay . let 's start with these strange powers of yours .	you think they 're strange ?
i did n't mean that in any pejorative way .	i guess they are a little odd .
well , i mean it 's not everybody that can deliver an air mail letter without putting a stamp on it .	i would n't do that . it 's against the law .
oh .	the reason i can fly is because my molecular structure is so constituted that i have a lighter density under earth 's gravitational force .
it must feel great .	it 's not bad .
how old are you ?	thirty-five .
how much do you weigh ?	195 pounds .
what about this x-ray vision of yours ?	what about it ?
can you really see through anything ?	uh-huh .
is it true you 're impervious to pain ?	yes . although i can get a headache just like anyone .
do bullets really bounce off you ?	only when somebody shoots them at me .
what color underwear am i wearing ?	pink .
can you actually fly faster than the speed of sound ?	sure .
do you like pink ?	very much .
where do you hail from ?	well , i was born on a planet your scientists do n't know too much about . it 's in the xeno galaxy . or it was . it was called krypton . that 's k-r-y-p ...
i ... uh ...	no speeches , otis . just watch what albert has prepared . what are you waiting for ?
now then , otis . did you get what i asked for ?	yessir . just what you wanted .
there .	not there ! a pine tree in death valley ? idiot ! this is for the north woods section !
did i do good , mr. luthor ?	excellent , otis . but what took you so long ?
what 's the matter , otis ?	matter ? with me ? nothing 's the matter .
i broke the man out of prison --	i 'll always be grateful , mr. luthor .
i gave him steady employment --	i 'll never forget you for that , mr. luthor .
i gave him this new face .	i ... uh ... check .
and now he lies to me . he has been stealing ladies ' purses again . have n't you ? have n't you , you miserable petty crook ?	i guess i ... uh ... regressed .
please ...	otis ...
is that real enough for you ?	it is for me .
but , to someone from the planet krypton , this substance would be lethal because of its high level of radioactivity . kryptonite ! ah , kryptonite ! that 's the stuff !	you mean bullets and fire and all that ca n't hurt him , but this kind of rock --
well , gents ? what did i tell you ? it 's a piece of cake .	it 's a twinkie , boss .
they 're killing me by inches ! go ahead ! make me suffer ! milk me dry .	maybe it 's being polished or something . maybe they 're cleaning it .
cleaning a rock , otis ? jot it down . as soon as we 're back , he feeds the pets .	oh , mr. luthor ...
i still do n't get it .	ah , dear simple otis . albert explain it to him .
sort of .	good enough for you . now then -- -- tell me something i like to hear . as many times as i hear it ...
what is this ? ? !	makes cecil b. demille look like the senior class play , right ?
well -- you 've got me ! what can i say ?	plenty ! about 'the crime of the century , ' remember ?
this is california . the richest , most populous state in america . and growing like a sonofagun .	i do n't need a geography lesson , luthor .
it 's just that -- i spent a fortune on these things ! and all for naught ! what a waste --	of time , luthor .
at the san andreas fault . maybe you 've heard of it .	sure . it 's the joining together of two land masses pushed together eight million years ago . the fault line itself is unstable and always shifting , which is the reason you get earthquakes in the california area from time to time .
nice ! most of california would have been destroyed . millions of people would 've been killed ! the west coast as we know it would have --	-- dropped into the sea ! bye-bye california ! hello , new west coast ! gold coast ! my coast . and now ... well ... i left my heart in san francisco ...
it would never have worked , luthor . you are a dreamer -- a sick , twisted dreamer .	maybe i should get help .
it would n't hurt . you ca n't go on living in fantasies . did you really think you could get hold of a nuclear bomb ? and drop it ? why , our strategic defense boys would have --	you 're right , you 're right , superman . there were wrinkles to iron out . but , well ... ... there is this new rocket , the xk 101 .
the xk 101. luthor , that operates on radio waves . and with our fail-safe system , only the president himself can push that button .	i know . i know . i never promised myself a rose garden .
still , foolishly , perhaps , i had a theory that eliminates the presidential push-button . i was doing my homework ...	on radio waves ?
luthor --	you guessed it ! you 're always one step ahead of me . are n't you superman ? yes , right . there was a police helicopter buzzing the area and transmitting on the same frequency as the garage doors . the minute the signal went out -- zip ! zip ! zip !
well , that 's their problem , t.s . but -- but the xk 101 also works on a radio wave control system . the problem was to find out the frequency . problems , problems , i 've had so many ...	they 'll soon be over .
well , it 's very impressive but you built this junk for nothing .	for the first time today , superman i must tell you that you 're wrong . but how could you know that - oh , well . i guess i could tell you now . y'see , actually ... but this conversation is becoming rather dry , is n't it .
now who 's the dreamer , superman ? even you ca n't fly that fast !	we 'll see how fast i can fly .
yes , we do know each other . i 'm alison jones .	alison jones .
yes .	ally . that was my nickname .
ally . that 's right .	how are you ?
i 'm just fine , ally . what about you ?	i 'm fine . still working with my father .
and what does he do again ?	he used to work with you . until you found out he was having an affair with your wife .
ally jones .	how is mrs. stephens ?
we 're ... not together .	i 'd heard that . but she 's well ?
yes ... fine .	and zoe ? how 's zoe ?
i 'm glad to hear that zoe 's okay .	are you still in touch ?
not really . the last time i saw her was at that clinic . that was a long time ago .	which one ?
which one ?	which clinic ?
i do n't remember the name . it was near a beach .	sunnyridge . that was a long time
so there were others ?	other clinics ? oh sure . clinics , half-way houses , treatment centers , detox units ...
then ... when did she get better ?	she did n't .
but you said ...	that 's where i 'm going . to see her .
she 's in trouble ?	yes . do you find there 's something strange about this meat ?
what ... does it turn to ?	it turns to steaming piss .
i 'm ... so sorry .	that 's okay .
i ... do n't think so .	i woke to the sound of zoe 's breathing . it was laboured . i looked over and noticed she was sweating and all swollen . i grabbed her , rushed to the kitchen , and splashed water on her face .
what happened ?	i did n't know . i was in a panic . i guessed she 'd been bitten by an insect , but there was no doctor . the nearest hospital was forty miles away , and zoe was continuing to swell . klara took her in her arms and tried to breast-feed her , while i dialed the hospital . i finally got a doctor on the line . he sounded young , but cool . he was confident , but there was a nervousness . he have been an intern . this was the first time he ever had to deal with anything like this . he wanted to seem like he knew what he was doing , but he was just as scared as i was .
what happened ?	nothing . we made it to the hospital . i did n't have to go as far as i was prepared to . but i was prepared to go all the way .
well , it was nice meeting you again , mr. stephens .	mitchell . it was nice to see you again , ally .
alison .	alison .
say hi to zoe .	i will .
i hope she gets better .	i 'll tell her that .
my name is ...	mister , i do n't want to know your name .
i understand .	no you do n't .
i can help you .	not unless you can raise the dead .
mr. mitchell stephens , esquire , would you be likely to sue me if i was to beat you right now ? beat you so bad that you pissed blood and could n't walk for a month . because that 's what i 'm about to do .	no , mr. ansel . i would n't sue you .
leave us alone , stephens . leave the people of this town alone . you ca n't help .	you can help each other . several people have agreed to let me represent them in a negligence suit . your case as an individual will be stronger if i 'm allowed to represent you together as a group .
case ?	the walkers have agreed . the ottos . nicole burnell 's parents . it 's important to initiate proceedings right away . things get covered up . people lie . that 's why we have to begin our investigation quickly . before the evidence disappears . that 's why i 'm out here tonight .
that 's my daughter . or it may be the police to tell me that they 've found her dead . she 's a drug addict .	why are you telling me this ?
that 's my daughter . or it may be the police to tell me that they 've found her dead . she 's a drug addict .	why are you telling me this ?
hi , nicole .	hi , mr. ansel . hi , jessica , mason ...
they just finished supper .	was it good ?
i 'll be back around nine .	okay .
are you sure ?	yeah .
it just seems ... kind of weird .	why ?
i do n't know .	nicole , i 'm just going to pack all this stuff and give it to the church for charity . do n't feel bad . unless you feel strange about wearing it .
no . i mean , i remember mrs. ansel wearing some of this stuff , but ... i do n't feel funny about that . i really liked her .	and she really liked you . she would 've given you all this if she 'd outgrown it , or ...
what do you mean 'outgrown it ' ?	i 'm not sure .
goodnight , mr. ansel .	goodnight , nicole .
why would he do that ? you did n't have anything to do with the accident .	because i was driving behind the bus , mary . because i saw it . i saw it happen ...
i used to like it here . i used to care about what happened . now i think i 'll sell my house and move the fuck away .	billy , please . the children .
how is nicole ? is she around ?	she 's resting . in her room .
so what brings you out tonight ?	well , sam , i might as well tell you the truth . it 's this lawsuit you 've gotten yourself all involved with . i want you to drop the damned thing .
i do n't see how that concerns you , billy .	it does concern me .
well , i do n't know why it should . there 's a whole lot of people in town involved with lawsuits . we 're hardly unique here , billy . i mean , i can understand how you feel .	how ?
well , it being so depressing and all . but it 's reality . you ca n't just turn this off because you happen to think it 's a bad idea .	why not ?
because it 's what we have to do .	well i do n't want a damned thing to do with it .
i 've tried to stay out of it . but it turns out that 's not so easy , sam . you 've gone and got yourself this lawyer . mitchell stephens . you and risa and wendell and the ottos .	so ? i mean , lot 's of folks have got lawyers .
if that bastard does subpoena me , if he forces me to go over this again , then all those other lawyers will line up behind him and try and do the same thing .	that wo n't happen , billy . mitch stephens ' case is small , compared to some of those other guys . the way he told me , all he needs is for you to say what you saw that day , driving behind the bus . i know it 's a painful thing to do , but it 'll only take a few minutes of your time . that 'll be the end of it .
that 's wrong , sam . you know that . we 'll be tangled up in this thing for the next five years . this is never going to go away ...	c'mon , you know that wo n't ...
no , billy . we ca n't drop the lawsuit . you know how much we need the money .	why ? you got money from dolores ' insurance with the school board . we all did .
it 's not enough . for hospital bills . for nicole .	i 'll help pay for nicole , if that 's what you 're really talking about . i 'll even give you the money i got for my kids . that 's what we used to do , remember ? help each other . this was a community .
nicole 's coming over to look after the kids tonight . she 'll be there around six .	billy , that 's too early .
she said she 's got to be home by nine .	ca n't you make it later ?
have you been waiting long ?	a while .
does this mean i ca n't take a shower ?	no . it should be dry by now .
what time 's he coming home ?	when the game 's over , i guess .
what are you thinking ?	tomorrow i 'm going to put sean on the bus . he wo n't want to go . he never does . he 'll cry and want to hold on to me .
yes .	it 's natural .
your kids never cry .	well , maybe that 's because they know i 'm going to follow them . behind the bus .
they can look forward to that .	sure .
you 're leaving .	i better get back .
good night , billy .	good night .
i stopped by the station a while ago . i stared at the bus . i could almost hear the kids inside . there was a lawyer there . he told me he 'd gotten you signed up . is that true ?	something made this happen , billy . mr. stephens is going to find out what it was .
mr. stephens says that someone did n't put a right bolt in the bus ...	risa , i serviced that bus . at the garage . there 's nothing wrong with it .
... or that the guardrail was n't strong enough .	you believe that ?
i have to .	why ?
because i have to .	well i do n't .
is it true that you gave nicole one of lydia 's dresses ? that she was wearing it when the bus crashed ?	yes .
why did you do that , billy ?	you think that caused the accident , risa ? that it brought bad luck ? christ , it sounds to me you 're looking for a witch doctor , not a lawyer . or maybe they 're the same thing .
dolores . no one calls me 'mrs . driscoll ' .	what do you mean by that , dolores ?
about the ottos ?	yes . what do you mean by 'hippies ' ?
i mean , the way they look . their hair and clothing ...	do they have any reputation for drugs ?
no , nothing like that . the ottos are what i 'd call model citizens . they 're regular at town meetings . they give their opinions in a respectful way . they always help out at various fund-raising bazaars in town , though they are n't church goers .	and they loved bear .
those are all from the fair last year . abbott and me were judges at the pet show .	for rabbits ?
billy loved to see his kids in the bus . they always sat in the back , so they could wave to each other . it comforted him .	from what ?
from what ?	did he have any particular problems that you knew of ? financial pressures ... run-ins with the law ...
no , nothing like that . billy 's wife , lydia , died of cancer a few years ago . he took over raising the children by himself . it was obvious how much he missed lydia .	you talked about it ?
that 's the way i thought of them sometimes .	berries .
abbott and i used to do a lot of that in the spring .	berry-picking .
yes . the old-fashioned way .	and what 's that ?
a strange little fellow , but you could n't help liking him . he was close to ten but seemed more like a frightened five or six .	were his parents ... attentive to him ?
what do you mean ?	you mentioned that he had a learning disability .
that 's right .	did his parents attend to that ?
what do you mean ?	did they give him special care ?
i have a question for you , mr. stephens .	what 's that , dolores ?
i told you that i was doing fifty miles an hour when the accident happened . that 's how i remembered it . but the truth is , i might have been doing sixty . or sixty five . and if that 's true , that i was over the limit when the bus went over , what would happen then ?	that would complicate things .
because i 'd be to blame , right ?	billy ansel will insist that you were driving fifty-one miles an hour . just like you 've done every morning for the past fifteen years .
he knows that ? billy ?	yes . he does .
you 've talked to billy ?	i did .
and billy told you that he 'll tell that to ...	mrs. driscoll , if billy ansel does not volunteer to say so in court , i will subpoena him and oblige him to testify to that effect .
it 's clear to me and other people that you have suffered significantly from this event .	what other people ?
excuse me ?	who 's been talking to you about what i 'm feeling ? who should care about what i 'm feeling ?
you heard what abbott said ?	yes .
anything you did n't understand ?	there might have been a word or two that slipped by . maybe you could clarify it for me , just to be absolutely sure .
that 's what he said , is it ?	yes . abbot understands these things .
he never took his eyes off his mother , even as he moved to sit beside nicole . he looked frightened .	why would he be frightened ?
good morning , wanda . hi , hartley .	hi , dolores .
what do you think ?	well , it 's certainly what you 'd call interesting .
you hate it .	i did n't say that .
i could wrap it up . protect the other kids .	i 'll just strap it on the roof .
it 's for the school bazaar .	oh , it 's bizarre alright . c'mon bear . let 's get you out of here .
away from your crazy mom .	the ottos always waited for the bus with bear . they were the only parents who did that , together like that . i guess they 're what you might call hippies .
you want a cup of tea or something ?	a cup of tea would be nice . would it be alright if i sit down for a few minutes , mrs. otto ? i want to talk to you .
but dolores said she saw a dog and tried to ...	how long has dolores been driving that bus , mr. otto ? how many times has she steered clear of danger ? what went wrong that morning ?
i did n't ask if you wanted milk .	no . a little sugar though .
we 've only got honey .	i 'll ... take it straight .
he thought it was cute when i called him frankenstein . it was n't . i feel like his monster .	is n't it a lovely day ?
what happened to summer ?	summer 's over . it 's fall .
and winter ?	well , winter 's far behind us now .
how was it ?	we had a terrible winter last year , did n't we , sam ?
so do you like your new room ?	it 's interesting .
your dad spent all his spare time in here . he wanted to make it absolutely perfect .	i feel like a princess .
is this mine ?	yes . it 's a present .
from you ?	no . from mr. stephens . that was him on the phone just now . he was calling to see how you were .
maybe we should n't be talking about this just now , with you barely home . are n't you hungry , honey ? want me to fix you something ?	no . what 's this lawyer business ?
nicole !	it 's the truth .
that was billy ansel on the phone . he wants to come over to talk to us .	did he say what about ?
no .	was he drinking ? could you tell ?
is he coming over now ? right away ?	that 's what he said .
hey , billy ! what brings you out on a night like this ? c'mon in . take a load off .	would you like a cup of tea , billy ? there 's a piece of cake left .
the pied piper of hamelin . by famous hanover city ; the river weser , deep and wide , washes its wall on the southern side ; a pleasanter spot you never spied ; but , when begins my ditty ...	what 's a ditty again ?
it 's like a song .	oh .
what 's vermin again ?	rats ! they fought the dogs and killed the cats , and bit the babies in the cradles , and ate the cheeses out of vats . and licked the soup from the cook 's own ladles , split open the kegs of salted sprats , made nests inside men 's sunday hats , and even spoiled the women 's chats , by drowning their speaking with shrieking and squeaking in fifty different sharps and flats ...
nicole ?	yes .
can i sit beside you on the bus tomorrow ?	do n't you usually like to sit at the back ? to wave at your dad ?
i want to sit beside you tomorrow .	okay .
nicole ?	what , mason ?
that 's right .	well , if he knew magic - if he could get the kids into the mountain - why could n't he use his pipe to make the people pay him for getting rid of the rats ?
because ... he wanted to them to be punished .	the people in the town ?
yes .	so he was mean ?
no . not mean . just ... very angry .	oh .
should i keep reading ?	okay .
i do n't like thinking about the accident . i do n't even remember it happening . besides , it just makes people feel sorry for me , and ...	you hate that .
you can only feel lucky that you did n't die for so long . then you start to feel ... unlucky .	that you did n't die ? like the other children ?
it would be strange if you did n't feel that way .	what do you want me to do for you , mr. stephens ?
they work for the people we 're trying to sue . their job is to try to minimize damages . our job , nicole , is to try to maximize them . you have to think of it that way . as people doing their jobs . no good guys or bad guys . just our side and their side .	i wo n't lie .
i do n't want you to lie .	the truth is that it was an accident , and no one 's to blame .
there 's no such thing as an accident , nicole . not in a situation like this .	you seem very sure about that .
dolores .	yes . dolores ... and even your mom and dad . but i 'll make sure you go last .
why ?	so you can keep on getting well before you have to go and do this . it 's not going to be easy , nicole . do you understand that ?
it was snowing .	unless the report from the national weather bureau for the district on january 23 goes into the record , i will object to that question .
i object to the form of that question . note that .	was the bus on time ?
there was nothing reckless in mrs. driscoll 's behavior ?	i object to that form of question . note that .
note my objection . she said , 'as i 'm talking . '	did there come a time when the bus turned off staples mill road onto
note that she said 'pretty clearly ' . not 'clearly ' .	and what was the weather like at this time ?
i have no questions .	thank you , nicole .
do you have a room ?	will you be spending more than a night ?
what about doreen ?	she ... she was a friend of mine .
when ?	at school . she fell for kyle just before we graduated . got pregnant , and ... went to live in a trailer up on a woodlot kyle 's dad used to own . kyle started spending more and more time at the spread eagle ...
that 's the local bar ?	... coming home drunk and i guess feeling trapped by his life and blaming her for that ... and ...
what do you mean ?	people who will help our cause .
that 's great , wendell . that 's the sort of thing i need to know . so it does n't come back to haunt our case later on .	there 's the prescots ...
tell me about the ottos .	wanda and hartley . they lost bear . he was their adopted son . a beautiful boy . indian .
yes .	that 's good . judges like adopted indian boys . tell me more about the ottos .
they 're smart . been to college . they moved here from the city about a dozen years ago .	what do they do ?
crafts .	crafts ?
have they ever been busted ?	no .
need a hand ?	sure , it you could find a towel in this bag . i know my wife packed one in there ...
you always think you 're prepared for these things .	tell me about it .
how old is she ?	almost three .
is this it ?	perfect .
here we go .	thanks .
i 'm in a car wash .	a car wash ! wow , i 've never talked to you when you 've been in a car wash. make sure you 've got the windows closed .
remember that time we were having the car washed and i started playing with the automatic window ? how old was i , daddy ? five or six ? i got absolutely soaked , remember ?	why are you calling me , zoe ?
nothing 's wrong with trying to talk to me , zoe .	so what 's the problem ?
the problem is i have no idea who i 'm talking to right now .	'cause you think i 'm stoned , daddy ? 'cause you think i 've got a needle stuck in my arm ? is that what you 're thinking , daddy ?
daddy ! ! !	yes .
why ca n't you talk to me ?	i ... i just need to know what state you 're in so i know ... how to talk to you ... how to act ...
yes , i 'll accept the charges .	daddy ?
yes .	i 'm calling because i 've got some news for you , daddy . some big news .
news ?	do n't you want to hear ?
yes . give me your news , zoe .	you always think you know what i 'm going to say , do n't you ? you always think you 're two steps ahead of me . the lawyer .
tell me your news , zoe .	okay . i went to sell blood yesterday . that 's how it is . i 'm in this fucking city where my father is a hot shit lawyer , and i 'm selling my blood .
that 's not news , zoe .	no . but this is . they would n't take my blood .
do you know what that means , daddy ? does it register ?	yes .
i tested positive .	yes .
what do you want me to do , zoe ? i 'll do whatever you want .	i need money .
what for ?	you ca n't ask me that ! not anymore ! you asked me what i wanted . not what i wanted it for . i want money .
do you have the blood test ?	you do n't believe me ? you do n't fucking believe me ?
i can hear you breathing , daddy .	yes . i can hear you breathing too .
oh god , i 'm scared .	i love you , zoe . i 'll be there soon , and i 'll take care of you . no matter what happens . i 'll take care of you .
some more wine ?	i 'm afraid this meat is overdone .
i 'm sorry about that , mr. stephens . would you like to try the fish ?	what is it ?
we do .	is there shrimp on it ?
yes .	if you could pick the shrimp off , as well as anything that touches the shrimp ...
i 'm not sure if that will leave much on the plate .	well , let 's see what we get .
i 'm sorry for coming over unannounced like this , mrs. otto , but the walkers said you would understand . i know it 's an awful time , but it 's important that we talk .	who are you ?
i 'm a lawyer .	you ca n't come here .
please , let me explain . i 'll only take a moment of your time .	no .
the walkers spoke very highly of you .	you 've been retained ?
yes .	their child died , and they got a lawyer .
it should be said that my task is to represent the walkers only in their anger . not their grief .	who did they get for that ?
dolores ?	it 's my belief that dolores was doing exactly what she 'd been doing for years . besides , the school board 's insurance on dolores is minimal . a few million at the very most . the really deep pockets are to be found in the town , or in the company that made the bus .
you think someone else caused the accident ?	mrs. otto , there is no such thing as an accident . the word does n't mean anything to me . as far as i 'm concerned , somebody somewhere made a decision to cut a corner . some corrupt agency or corporation accounted the cost variance between a ten-cent bolt and a million dollar out-of-court settlement . they decided to sacrifice a few lives for the difference . that 's what 's done , mrs. otto . i 've seen it happen so many times before .
so you 're just the thing we need .	excuse me ?
is n't that what you want us to believe ? that we 're completely defenseless ? that you know what 's best ?	listen to me , mrs otto . listen very carefully . i do know what 's best .
are you expensive ?	no .
if you agree to have me represent you in this suit , i will require no payment until after the case is won , when i will require one third of the awarded amount . if there is no award made , then my services will cost you nothing . it 's a standard agreement .	do you have this agreement with you ?
are you a reporter ?	no .
kyle lambston 's a drunk . nobody likes him . he 's a nasty piece of work .	in what way ?
been drinking since high school . fucked himself up . used to be smart enough .	any criminal record ?
probably half a dozen traffic convictions . drunk driving . lost his licence . that 's why he do n't work no more .	ca n't get off that shitty dump they live on . what little money comes in goes to booze .
how does the family survive ?	do n't know . food banks , welfare , church charity . they scrape by .
now on that morning , did there come a time , nicole , when you left your parents ' house ?	yes .
what time in the morning was this ?	about eight-thirty in the morning .
no . i was alone . my sister jenny was sick and stayed home that day .	was there anything unusual about the driver , dolores driscoll , or the bus that particular morning ?
yes .	and where did you sit that morning ?
my usual place . on the right side . the first seat .	and according to your recollection , there was nothing unusual about the drive that morning ?
no .	did there come a time when all the children had been picked up ?
yes .	you remember that much ?
yes .	there was a brown dog that ran across the road up there , right by the dump , and dolores slowed down not to hit him , and he ran into the woods . and then dolores drove on and turned onto the marlowe road , as usual . i remember that . i 'm remembering it pretty clearly .
you are ?	yes .
i will offer that report . well , then , now that your memory seems to be clearing , can you tell us what else you observed at that time ?	before the actual accident ?
i was scared .	why were you scared ?
this is before the accident , nicole . do you understand what i 'm asking ?	yes , i understand .
why were you scared ?	dolores was driving too fast .
mrs. driscoll was driving too fast ? what made you think that , nicole ?	the speedometer . and it was downhill there .
you could see the speedometer ?	yes . i looked . i remember clearly now . it seemed we were going too fast down the hill . i was scared .
how fast would you say mrs. driscoll was going ? to the best of your recollection ?	seventy-two miles an hour .
seventy-two miles an hour ? you 're sure of this ?	positive .
you believe that the bus driven by mrs. driscoll was going at seventy- two miles an hour at this time ?	i told you i was positive . the speedometer was large and easy to see from where i was .
you saw the speedometer ?	yes .
did you say anything to mrs. driscoll ?	no .
why not ?	i was scared . and there was n't time .
there was n't time ?	no . because the bus went off the road . and crashed .
you remember this ?	yes . i do now . now that i 'm telling it .
what do you remember about the accident ?	i remember the bus swerved , it just suddenly swerved to the right , and it hit the guardrail and the snowbank on the side of the road , and then it went over the embankment there , and everyone was screaming and everything . and that 's all . i guess i was unconscious after that . that 's all . then i was in the hospital .
that was great .	really ?
you 're going to blow everyone away .	you mean it ?
of course .	you do n't sound like one hundred percent absolutely sure .
what 's so funny ?	just the way dolores gets so excited about bringing the kids to check out the animals . it 's like the biggest thing in her life .
what took so long ?	nothing .
what 's that ?	mrs. ansel 's clothing .
they say i 'm lucky because i ca n't remember the accident .	do n't even try to remember .
how do you like it , nicole ?	the ramp ?
pretty slick , eh ?	very slick .
do you like the colour ?	it 's okay .
the door needs a lock .	sure . i 'll fix it right away .
that 's too high . i 'll never reach it .	oh . i better get some spackle .
he 's a lawyer . he 's our lawyer .	you and mom have a lawyer ?
well , yes . he 's your lawyer too .	my lawyer ? why do i need a lawyer ?
it 's because of the accident , nicole . most people in this town whose kids were on the bus have got lawyers . a lot of people ... well , people in this town are very angry . us included .	but you did n't lose me .
you 're going to need special care for a long time to come . it 's not going to be easy . not for you , not for any of us . because we love you so much . and it 's going to cost money . more than we can imagine .	what about insurance ? does n't insurance pay for these things ?
partly . but there 's a lot the insurance does n't cover . that 's one of the reasons we have a lawyer . to make sure the insurance gets paid and to help us look after the rest .	how will he do that ?
what are you up to , nicole ?	nothing .
nothing good on your t.v . ?	as opposed to this t.v . ?
are you sleeping ?	no .
nicole , tomorrow mr. stephens wants you to make your deposition at the courthouse . i thought i 'd take you over .	great .
what do you mean ?	i mean i 'm a wheelchair girl now . it 's hard to pretend i 'm a beautiful rock star . not like you used to tell me . remember , daddy ? all the people that were going to discover me ? where are they now ?
he could n't look at me . but i looked at him . right at him . his secret was mine now . we used to share it . but not anymore . now , i owned it completely .	well , okay . i 'll take you about nine-thirty in the morning . that 's okay with you ?
yes .	how about sunday night ? that 's always the best time .
what 's going to happen to dolores ?	i do n't know .
will the police do anything to her ?	it 's too late for that . she ca n't drive the bus anymore . the school board saw to that right off .
she 'll move away .	there 's talk of that .
well , there 's the hamiltons . joe and shelly hamilton .	yeah , right .
that sonofabitch owes thousands to the bank and half the businesses in town . he 's about to lose his house and car .	but charlene ...
do n't even think of the bilodeaus or the atwaters . they 're all inbred .	the ottos .
yeah , well , they probably smoke weed .	you do n't know that .
loretta ... sidney falco ...	how do you do , mr. falco . if you know anything about horses , sit a minute . help yourself to a glass of this n.y. state champagne - that 's what my husband buys me .
you ought to stop this nonsense , loretta , these two dollar bets .	it 's compensation , leo , for the marginal life we lead . sidney , did you hear the story about the cloak-and-suitor who -- ?
that 's right ! tell him , so i can read it in hunsecker 's column first !	oh , are you a spy for the other side ?
will you mind your own business !	hitler !
where are we running ? what am i missing here ?	waiter , the check . this man is trying to hold a gun to my head !
how are you tonight , mr. falco ?	is `` he '' inside ?
but of course ...	alone or surrounded ?
hello , sidney . wan na table ?	just hopping tonight . leo bartha been in ?
he 's somewhere ...	thanks , i see him ...
come on boys , break it up ...	the next time you want information , falco , do n't scratch for it like a dog - ask for it like a man !
did she accept ?	you do n't like it , do you . i think she will accept , but i 'm not sure . she may be too dependent on her brother .
excuse me , steve . i said namely you should n't go around wild , blaming people without justification .	i thought you might have a faint idea of how this item originated .
boys , this gets nobody nowhere - you 're over excited , steve and -	do n't apologize for me , frank !
i want to speak to miss hunsecker , please .	we 're on our way there now ...
i still think he 's responsible for the smear .	not that i 'm convinced , but you 'll never prove it in a million years . steve , you 'll do what you want , but it ca n't hurt ; he offers you an olive branch - so today like olives !
i could think of better places to meet her , instead of here . he lives on the whole top floor .	i doubt that it matters any more .
joe , give my nephew a drink .	your nephew does n't want a drink .
that 's a lollipop that , boy . the kid is only great .	and with ten percent of his future , you 're great , too , frank .
went over to philly yesterday an ' seen the folks ... it 's nice you send them the fifty a month ...	see my mother ?
thanks for the publicity spread you got the boys for the benefit tomorrow .	robard 's my client . i did it for him and his club , not your boys .
frank , i think maybe you lied to me .	looka , sidney , you 're my own sister 's son , but where does that give you the right to call me a liar ?
you told me that your boy was washed up with susie hunsecker , did n't you ?	yeah , and it 's the truth , to the best of my knowledge . and , frankly , i 'm glad . for steve 's sake , i 'm glad , not yours . i manage these boys and i got their best interests at heart . steve should n't get mixed up with no bimbo at his age .
you told him that ?	not in those exact words - you know what a temper he 's got .
when do these hot-headed boys of yours go on the road ?	coupla weeks . for eight weeks .
that 's a nice tour . all booked ? when was susie around here last ?	four five nights ago . that 's how i know the romance is off . also steve 's in a very bad mood .
listen , frank , you 'd better make sure you 're telling me the truth .	i do n't like this threatening attitude . when it comes to it , what the heck is it your business what they do , this boy and girl ...
... people catch on quick to such an item . van cleve already called me - he 's firing the quintet .	then what are you doing here ? go over there and fight ! if van cleve fires your boy , it gives a lie the ring of truth !
i see bartha gave you cold tongue for supper . hey , wait a minute !	i 'm late for a date with a dame .
how is dear old j.j. by the way ?	call him up and ask - he might drop dead with shock .
you do n't know that lunatic yet ? whims - egotistic whims ! like the gag - when you got him for a friend , you do n't need an enemy ! that 's what the fight with bartha was about . `` leo '' , i says , `` hunsecker froze me out . so i 'm eating humble pie this month - please print me an item . ''	and , instead , he printed his heel in your face ?
friends call me otis - sometimes tricky otis .	otis was outraged when i told him van cleve was going to fire you . tell him not to pay any attention to anything you-know-who says about you-know-what . right , otis ?
i hate j.j. -- but not that much at this moment ...	give me a chance --
blessings on thee , the both ... well ... got ta run now . see you two kids later !	hurry back .
well , son , looks like you went out and bought yourself a packet of trouble ...	you 've been very kind about it , mr. hunsecker . hunsecker give susie credit for that . i took her word that there was nothing to the smear . matter of fact , i 'll have my say about smears on the show today . that 's why i 'd like your personal assurance , too .
mr. hunsecker , there 's nothing to that smear . you have my sincere word ...	i 'll by that , son . now , you owe me a favor . be good to my kid sister ...
take it easy , susie . he would n't be much of a man if he did n't understand my concern . would you , son ?	no , i would n't ...
does he have to be here in our hair ?	why , has he bothered you before ?
is it news to you ?	son , lots of people tell me i 'm a gifted man , but i still ca n't see around corners .
just exactly what are you so hot about ? i mean , i know it 's a difficult thing to be an artist in this crudest of possible worlds , but --	nuts ! i 'm not here as an artist ! i 'm here as an average joe , who happens to love your sister susie !
frankly , son , you lost me on that last hill . just give us the punch line ...	no punch line . maybe i was just admiring your know-how -- -yours and falco 's .
why do you keep coupling me with falco ?	he 's here , is n't he ? do you think , sir , when he dies he 'll go to the dog and cat heaven ?
i do n't take kindly to you and falco selling me ethics . who 's the injured party here , you ?	right now you 're in no position to ask questions ! and your snide remarks -- -
mr. hunsecker , you 've got more twists than a barrel of pretzels .	you hear that , susie ... continue please ...
susie , as always , is free to say anything she thinks . go on , dear , say exactly what 's on your mind , dear .	those `` dears '' sound like daggers . may i suggest that you stop daring her to speak ?
may i lift my eyebrows ? what is this ? what are you trying to do ?	i 'm trying to get susie to stand up to you . but your manner is so threatening that she 's afraid to speak !
if looks could kill , i 'm dead ...	no , i do n't care about you -- you 're fantastic . my whole interest , if it 's not too late , is in susie ... and how to undo what you 've done to her ...
and what have i done to her , besides not buy her a new fur coat lately ? sidney , you were right -- the boy 's a dilly .	why ? because i do n't like the way you toy with human lives ? - your contempt and malice ? because i wo n't be the accomplice of your sick ego - and the way it 's crippled susie ... ? you think of yourself - you and your column - you see yourself as a national glory ... but to me , and thousands of others like me , you and your slimy scandal , your phony patriotics - to me , mr. hunsecker , you are a national disgrace !
but my day with susie is n't over yet and --	ten 'll get you fifty you 're playing hookey from a padded cell !
susie , you 're very much in my thoughts today .	why ?
what a question , dear , with that newspaper in your hand ...	did sidney tell you about it ?
not being partial , are you ?	no , i 'm not . i 'm not !
why are you trembling , dear ... ?	history repeats itself . everything that happened to alan leslie ... began with a smear like this ...
it 's just as if i 've seen a ghost today ...	but that was n't your fault , dear , what happened to leslie . i 've told you that a million times ...
then whose fault was it , j.j. ? it was someone 's fault , was n't it ?	i would n't have called the boy exactly balanced ...
sidney is a liar !	who said sidney ?
you know , dear , we 're drifting apart , you and i , and i do n't like that .	i thought we were talking about sidney ?
let me finish , dear . you had your say , now let me have mine ...	i have n't said anything yet , j.j. , but if -
i started to say we 're drifting apart . a year ago , in your wildest dreams , would you have walked by that door without taking up this situation with me ? today i had to call you in !	i 'm taking up the situation with you now ...
when i 'm certain , i 'll let you know ...	a man could n't ask for a squarer shake . let me have billy van cleve ... do n't ever tell anyone , susie , how i 'm tied to your apron strings ... billy ! j.j. ! what 's this about that boy ? what boy ? where are we , lug , in a drawing room comedy ? you 're brain is warming up , sweetheart - yeah , dallas ! ... no , do n't explain your point of view , but ...
susie likes to keep her girlish secrets . but in her heart of hearts i imagine , dallas , that she fancies you in an uncommon way . now , what about you , son ? not just tom-catting around ... i hope ?	j.j. , steve is n't ...
susie , did you know about this accusation ... ?	no ...
susie , i 'm sorry if -- -	sometimes i think all men are fools ! ...
you in a mood , susie , to run over to milgrim 's later and buy a few new frocks ?	no . i 'm going home .
no ! no ! do n't touch me !	susan ! ...
err ... the supreme court story , i was telling you - justice black .	yes , the justice , that 's right . but i think you had it in the column .
and i believe that 's precisely where i read it , too . you see , j.j. , where i get my reputation for being the best-informed man in washington .	now do n't kid a kidder .
now , come , j.j. , that 's a little too harsh . anyone seems fair game for you tonight .	this man is not for you , harvey , and you should n't be seen with him in public . because that 's another part of a press agents life - he digs up scandal among prominent men and shovels it thin among the columnists who give him space .
there is some allusion here that escapes me ...	we 're friends , harvey - we go as far back as when you were a fresh kid congressman , do n't we ?
hello , harry .	bonna sera , commendatore . come sta ?
i just checked `` downtown '' . quiet everywhere tonight .	incidentally , what happened to that doll ? - you gave me the item last night . still alive ?
yeah . at bellevue . still hanging on . but they still do n't know if she was pushed .	she mighta jumped . love suicide ? check it for me , phil ... it 's a real heart throb .
say hello to sidney falco . tickle him - he 's been a bad boy tonight . he called you my fat friend .	i do n't believe it .
say , that 's good - it 's nice - in fact , it 's apt , harry !	yeah , i got eyes . i put things together .
can i come out ? no .	i have to talk to you , alone , j.j. , that 's why .
you had something to do for me - you did n't do it .	can i come in for a minute ?
mac ! i do n't want this man at my table ...	i have a message from your sister .
i know manny davis .	everyone knows manny davis ... ... except mrs. manny davis .
match me , sidney ...	not just this minute , j.j ... .
why do n't you answer the man , sidalee ? he 's trying to take you off the hook .	you just had a good example of it . a press agent eats a columnists dirt and is expected to call it manna .
what , some cheap , gruesome gags ?	you print them , do n't you ?
yes , with your clients ' names attached . that 's the only reason those poor slobs pay you - to see their names in my column all over the world ! now , as i make it out , you 're doing me a favor !	i did n't say that , j.j .
spahish ... that must show he likes `` spigs '' , too .	i like harry , but i ca n't deny he sweats a little .
you told me you 'd break up that romance - when ?	you want something done , j.j. , but i doubt if you yourself know what 's involved .
i 'm a schoolboy - teach me , teach me .	why not break it up yourself ? you could do it in two minutes flat .
frankly , j.j. , i do n't think you got the cards to blitz me .	i do n't ?
correct me if i 'm wrong , but i do n't think so ...	i 'll listen one more minute .
awright , that brings us up to five weeks ago . `` sidney , i got a nasty little problem here . '' did i say no ? i 'm frank to admit - it do n't jell as fast as we like ... but all of a sudden i ca n't get you on the phone no more ! why ? ... and why , as of this date , am i frozen out of the column ...	are you finished ?
no , lem me finish . i do n't like this job ! that boy is dumb only on matinee days - otherwise he 's got a head . and susan , like you said , she 's growing up . two heads . what i mean , we got a slippery , dangerous problem here !	not `` we '' , sidney , you !
correct me if i 'm wrong - we ! because when i 'm out on this very slippery limb for you , you have to know what 's involved .	ha ! my right hand has n't seen my left hand for thirty years !
i 'll do it , j.j. - do n't get me wrong - in for a penny , in for a pound . i 'll see it through , but stop beating me around the head . let me make a living !	what you promised - do it ! do n't finagle around . it 's later than you think .
uh huh .	when ?
j.j. , i want you to get them back their job , steve and the quintet .	you mean they 've been fired already , on the basis of this crude smear ?
i know steve . no .	then maybe you can tell me if he 's as solid as you say , why does he rap me every chance he gets ?
well , what have i got ? alimony to a pair of tramps ? they 're of no concern to me . it 's you who count , but do n't get me wrong - i do n't intend to let you break your neck again !	j.j. , you said you want to help me - prove it !
how ?	get steve back his job ... please ...
he means that much to you ... ?	yes . with your `` prestige '' it only takes a minute - ten cents worth of american tel and tel .
you 're picking up my lingo , hon .	i read your column every day ...
susie , i like this new attitude of yours . you 're growing up and i like it ! i do n't like it when you 're limp and dependent , when you 're odd and wayward . this gives you a chance for real survival in a very lousy world . because , do n't forget , dear , you wo n't always have me with you , will you ... ?	no , i wo n't ...
i 'm not sure i can reach him in time .	sure you can if you want to , and i know you 'll want to ... by the way , what 's your beef against little sidney ?
i got that boy coming over here . what 's so funny ?	with a pocket fulla firecrackers - good .
i think you loused this up but good . if i can trust my eyes , and i think i can , susie knows all about your dirty work .	ca n't hurt ...
ca n't hurt ? i had to get him back his job .	i like that , too . look , j.j. , we can wrap this up in one neat bundle , addressed to the dumps - to oblivion . we 're going great , but please play it my way . i cased this kid . know his ins and outs ... he 's fulla juice and vinegar , just begging for some big shot like you to give him a squeeze . do little sidney a favor : squeeze ! - you know , j.j. - the porcupine bit - needles .
but it 's too late . i got him back the job ...	no , that 's the point - he wo n't accept your favor ! the manager yes , but not the boy .
well he 's got her in a tizzy , i 'll tell you that !	sure , he steams her up - wants her to stand on her own two feet and all that jazz !
and who 's feet is she on now ?	presumably yours ... that 's according to st. dallas .
what 's this boy got that susie likes ?	integrity - acute , like indigestion .
what does that mean - integrity ?	a pocket fulla firecrackers - looking for a match ! it 's a new wrinkle to tell the truth ... i never thought i 'd make a killing on some guy 's `` integrity '' .
full of beans , ai n't you ? but you know that you 'll stand or fall by what you 're doing now ...	calculated risk . only we happen to know , j.j. , that you like me . i 'm your star pupil -- i reflect back to you your own talent .
let 's forget cats and dogs and other pseudo-literary remarks -- - i 'll just lay it on the line ! what about that big rumpus in my office today ? you were there , frank ! where , according to st. dallas , j.j. was responsible for the elwell smear !	do n't go wild , sidney .
what are you so chipper about ? if i put a cross on every one of your mistakes , you 'd look like a graveyard !	but not for anything i did today ...
are you listening ?	how does it matter who 's sister ? the main thing , they 're through and -
why do something that would drive them right back into each other 's arms ? not to mention that this time susie would know who shot the arrow ...	she knows now .
j.j. , it 's one thing to wear your dog collar ... but when it gets to be a noose ... i 'd rather have my freedom .	the man in jail is always for freedom .
sidney , i told you -	j.j. , i swear to you on my mother 's life , i wo n't do it . if you gave me your column i would n't do a thing like that ...
i was trying to build her up , not tear her down -	is that why you were romancing her , you mutt ! let 's call it quits , my dear . i 'd like it fine if you found another home . that means the front door is open ! pack your things , rent a moving van and git ! and as for marriage , let me hit you with a few choice facts : you are n't ready for marriage ! you 're incompetent - a capricious and shaky frail with a sick fatality for frail and useless men !
talk to her , sidney ...	talk to her yourself ...
listen with care - this will cost me everything , so you know i 'm telling you the truth !	you 're incapable of the truth ...
i know ... i know you 're the strongest cop in town .	i call him the boy with the ice cream face !
what 's all the rush ? you said three o'clock .	he 's leaving early . after this `` set '' . he 'll be out in a couple of minutes ...
it 's nice , sidney , that you give me this tip ...	- he 's got them on him .
is that a fact ? he 's a dilly , ai n't he ? by the by , what did he have against this boy ?	he goes out with girls .
well , i 'll be darned . and what does j.j. think he should do ?	go out with different girls !
i thought he would .	yeah ... and another thing - he 's gon na say you 'resisted arrest ' ... you know j.j ... . !
that 's a question i usually like to ask you . your secretary phoned .	what about ?
could this be that boy ?	dallas ? could be . he does n't look like a reefer smoker ...
bribing me again ?	and why should i bribe the woman who holds most of my heart ?
who put this item in about the comic ? `` if there 's a more hilarious funny man around than herbie temple at the palace , you 'll have to pardon us for not catching the name . we were too busy screaming . '' does this temple have a press agent ?	no . it 's one of j.j. 's occasional beau gestes . evidently the fellow 's funny , so he gave him a plug .
what 's your favorite ribbon to go around your favorite chocolates ?	let 's wait till christmas - it 's more legitimate then .
do n't you ever get messages , eyelashes ? i called you twice .	i 've been up to here . listen , honey , tell me something . you know susan hunsecker ... ? has she been in ? i mean lately , in the last coupla days ... ?
i do n't think so .	you 're sure . find out for me .
is frank d'angelo around ?	at the bar - sidney ...
do n't tell me you started a polka with leo bartha ?	no . that 's what i mean - i 'm being fired for what i did n't do .
avidly . he was staring .	staring . consequently , when he approached me on his way out i was n't surprised , but i did n't let on .
he was writing a special sunday piece on ... ?	... cigarette girls ... and naturally -
you were thrilled to be interviewed . were you `` interviewed '' ?	in his apartment -
and where was his wife ?	i do n't know - it 's a big apartment . but i was n't interviewed . in fact , i was totally unprepared for what happened .
we 're old friends , chickie - quit it ! a big columnist comes in this room , without his ball-and-chain and you make like a delicatessen counter ! what did you think would happen in his house ?	but , sidney darling , the man must be out of his mind - it was only eleven o'clock in the morning !
do you think you could do something , sidney ?	that 's what i 'm thinking , rita . maybe ...
do you still keep your key under the mat ?	can you be there by two-thirty ?
rita , say hello to otis elwell .	hello .
back ?	one of those business meetings , honey - always coming up in the middle of the night .
do n't you know who that man is ?	yeah . otis elwell . the columnist .
yeah !	and he 's a perfect stranger to me .
what do you want all of a sudden - lady godiva ... ? where 's my other shoe ?	what kind of an act is this ?
do n't you think i have any feelings ? what am i ? a bowl of fruit ? a tangerine that peels in a minute ?	i beg your pardon ! i turn myself inside out to help you and now i 'm a heavy . here 's your shoe , there 's your coat , that 's the door !
sidney ... i ... i do n't do this sort of thing ...	what sort of thing ?
this sort of thing !	listen , you need him for a favor , do n't you ! and so do i ! i need his column -- tonight . did n't you ask me to do something about your job ? do n't you have a kid in military school ?
a girl needs a little romancing before she -	next time i 'll call in a guy to paint silver stars on the ceiling !
what would you think of me if -	nothing i did n't think of you before .
that 's the third time he 's called today .	he wants me to break a leg ?
no , an arm , he said . i told him you were sure the item would be in mr. hunsecker 's column in tomorrow 's ...	it is n't . i 've just seen the early edition .
but ...	but what ?
that makes five days in a row that mr. hunsecker 's cut you out of his column .	may i rent you out as an adding machine .
who else phoned ?	the renting agent and the tailor .
pay the rent . let the tailor wait .	it wo n't leave much of a balance in the bank ... mr. robard ? could you locate him ?
i wish i could help in some way , sidney .	help me with two minutes of silence !
go home , sally . it 's late ...	i hate to see you like this --
yes , but as a new subscriber you 're under no obligation to take more than three books . and if you mail the enclosed card within ten days --	sidney , i know you by now . do n't do a dance with me ...
you mean you do n't want the extra free gift of a colorful giant map of the world ? ? ?	sidney , please , dear , if you feel nervous ...
so what 'll you do if i feel nervous ? you 'll open your meaty , sympathetic arms ... ?	sid ... you got me so ... i do n't know what ...
you ought to be used to me by now .	i 'm used to you ...
if that 's for me , tear it up !	take a top coat .
what 's the matter ?	nothing ...
did you send my folks in philly the check ... ?	yes .
i put a lotta trust in you , chickie ...	i know you do , sidney .
i swear , sidney , i ca n't help it - sometimes i wonder what i see in you ...	that 's no way to talk ...
or what you see in me , for that matter ...	stay down town tonight . maybe we 'll take in a show , etc .
where 's those glossy prints you promised ? tonight 's the latest i can place them -	well , thanks , anyway - let 's forget it . it 's cold out here , susie .
i 'm feeling too good to fight with you , but that is n't what i said - i said you snoop . for instance , what were you doing around my hotel the other night ?	begging your pardon , i have n't been down the bowery in years !
it 's a habit with me . so now i 'm briefed . so what ?	frank thinks i should n't have come here -
why me ... ?	why not you ?
that 's your idea of logic ? i tell the judge i did n't murder the man - the judge says , `` why not you ? ''	only two men in this town could be responsible for that smear - you or hunsecker or both .
dallas , ask your own manager - he 's standing here like a pained wolfhound - hunsecker and elwell are enemies to the knife . so how do you get him doing j.j. a favor ?	it is a favor , is n't it ?
you 're talking very fast .	well , i 'll tell you what - excuse me for breathing , will ya ? how do you like it ? he comes to my office and -
frank , you do n't listen ! j.j. just told you to shut your mouth !	do n't you think it 's about time you shut yours ? who are you to tell a man like frank d'angelo to shut up ? !
give him credit -- -the boy 's gall is gorgeous !	why do n't we hear what susie has to say ?
you watch him , al , i s ... s ... stutter !	temple , i caught your act the other night and -
did you now ? on which bounce ?	- and i just had to drop by and tell you how great i thought you were .
no , i do n't mind . i 'm busy too .	good ! we 're all off to utica , so excuse me , mr. frannis-on-the- portisan .
if there 's a funnier man in the world than herbie temple at the palace ... uh ... pardon us for not catching the name , we were too busy laughing . no , make that 'screaming ' . it 's sweet of you , j.j. , thanks . probably see you at twenty one tonight . no , for supper , late . right . 'bye ...	speak to this lad , al , ... to mr. falco .
and it would cost a pretty penny , huh ?	you tell him , i stutter !
you 're touchy , sidney - do n't be so touchy ...	i was n't looking for a brawl . i came to bring him a present . wan na bite to eat ?
feels like a monday night , do n't it ... ?	not to me . sometimes , the world feels like a cage . then someone comes along and opens the door ... and it 's never monday night again ... i wish you and steve could like each other .
we stick in each others craw .	yes , but why ?
where do you come off to make a remark like that ?	who could love a man who keeps jumping through burning hoops , like a trained poodle ?
do you think j.j. likes steve ... ?	frankly , yes , to my surprise . he thinks he 's very gifted - those boys 'll go a big mile , he thinks .
it 's given me a big lift to know that some people want me for myself , not just because i 'm my brother 's sister .	chickie , i 'll have to laugh at that - an attractive girl like you ... !
i hope that j.j. really likes steve , that it is n't an act .	why should he put on an act ? your brother has told presidents where to go and what to do !
it 's not my nature , susie , but i 'll talk to you like an uncle ...	but i do n't need an uncle , sidney .
listen , get a good night 's sleep - tomorrow 's another day . feeling sorry for yourself wo n't help .	i 'm sorry about steve , not myself . i 'm even sorry for my brother . to be so lonely , without one real friend in the world - to have to hang on to a worthless rag of a girl like me because she 's his only real family -
and i 'm sorry for you , too , sidney . you 're going down with the ship .	what ship ?
susie , whatever problems you have with j.j. - i did n't invent them ! what 're you blaming me for ? if you learned to let out your hatred you would be better off !	like you ?
yeah ! like me ! i do n't choke on my own gall - i fight back ! let them choke , not me !	i 'm not a man , sidney , i 'm -
i know that bit - you 're a girl ; you need a man to give you strength ! so what do you pick such weak sisters for ? do n't you know yet that you fight fire with fire , not with tear drops ?	i could almost forgive you if what you did to steve came from jealousy and love ...
i did n't do anything !	... but you did it for greed , sidney - and that 's pathetic .
do n't run away - i was always the man for you ! i 'm talking to you out of two years of silence - listen to what i say ! inside of six months -	please , sidney , i ca n't stand this -
j.j. , if you think -	do n't explain , sidney ... it does n't matter now ...
jimmy ! this is a coincidence . i am just going -	yeah . a coincidence you should run into the very man you 've been ducking all week ! this is my press agent , joan .
i tried to reach you twice -	what do you do for that hundred a week . fall out of bed ?
jimmy , i 'm on my way inside right now to talk to hunsecker . i can promise you -	joan , call a cop ! we 'll arrest this kid for larceny !
listen , when your band was playing at roseland -	that was two months ago . take your hand out of my pocket , thief !
no more you do n't ! what is this - you 're showing off for her ? they 're supposed to hear you in korea ?	he 's intuitive - he knows he 's getting fired !
this is big , you know . very big ! let 's go out later , drink some firewater . with the boys . fred can call millie and -	steve , i 'd rather you did n't say anything for a day or two ... until i tell my brother ...
you have n't told him yet ...	i 'm telling him in the morning after breakfast .
steve , my brother is n't as bad as he 's painted . he is n't perfect , but -	but he is n't going to like this , susie . and he makes you nervous , not me . no , i take that back - he makes me nervous , too . but i would n't give him a second thought if not for you .
his stooge , falco , is around - i saw him walk in . he 's been spying on me for weeks , susie .	darling , i do n't care - really i do n't . sidney 'd had a secret crush on me for years , but nothing we do is his business -
but he could be reporting back to your brother , could n't he ?	steve , dear , please forget all of this . what can it matter after tomorrow ?
i have a message for you ; i love you . may i dedicate the next number to you ? ... and the next , and the next . every sunday i 'll buy you a new bonnet -	if the stores are open -
and on monday , i 'll take it off and stroke your light brown hair and -	and on tuesday - hasenpfeffer . steve how do you think i realized i love you ?
i made you write a beautiful song ...	no , you had me eating that chinese food ! ...
i get the feeling , falco , that you 're always snooping around ...	steve , stop it please ...
hello , steve . i 'm glad you could come .	why did you call me ?
steve ... what you tried to do today ... you tried to take me up on a high mountain ... i could n't go all the way ... i failed you ... will you forgive me ? have i lost you , steve ? have i ... ?	well , maybe i was wrong , too ... but there 's no doubt , susie , that we have to face some serious things ...
no one 's ever stood up to my brother the way you did .	but you did n't do much about it , susie . you walked out , and there i was ... solo ... and not too good at that .
i just did n't think that i could antagonize him , steve -- for our sake , i mean .	susie , i was there for our sake , too . but what a world it would be if we were all afraid to learn to walk and talk because it might offend poppa ! by the way , i think your brother was completely responsible for the smears ...
steve , i ...	but i do n't care about that now . he knew what he was doing today . he was laying down the conditions under which he might consent to our marriage - if i would bend to every whim of his , like sidney ! i could n't do that , susie ...
no ! i 'm saying that for your sake you have to make a clean break with your brother !	but , please , steve , please - one step at a time ! i was born only yesterday ! ...
steve , i feel exhausted ... what do you want me to do ?	not what you 're doing now . at least do n't ask me - do n't ask him . you 're fighting for your life ! what do you want to do ?
you going to work all day ?	i 'm sorry , baby . this thing is just kicking my ass . i thought we had it with this one ...
... but the output went to shit after three seconds . i 'm thinking now it 's the way i 'm matrixing the command hierarchies ...	you need a break . you 'll see it clear when you come back .
i ca n't	miles , it 's sunday . you promised to take the kids to raging waters today .
baby , this thing is going to blow 'em all away . it 's a neural-net process --	i know . you told me . it 's a neural-net processor . it thinks and learns like we do . it 's superconducting at room temperature . other computer are pocket calculators by comparison . but why is that so goddamn important , miles ? i really need to know , 'cause i feel like i 'm going crazy here , sometimes .
imagine a jetline with a pilot that never makes a mistake , never gets tired , never shows up to work with a hangover . meet the pilot .	why did you marry me , miles ? why did we have these two children ? you do n't need us . your heart and your mind are in here . but it does n't love you like we do .
but i thought ... are n't we changing things ? i mean ... right now ? changing the way it goes ?	that 's right ! there 's no way i 'm going to finish the new processor now . forget it . i 'm out of it . i 'm quitting cyberdyne tomorrow ... i 'll sell real estate , i do n't care , , ,
please ... let ... the kids ... go ...	shut up ! shut up ! ! motherfucker ! it 's all your fault ! it 's your fault ! !
do you know about the chip ?	what chip ?
they told us not to ask where they got it . i thought ... japan ... hell , i do n't know . i did n't want to know .	those lying motherfuckers !
we should abort .	no ! ! we 're going all the way ! you got that , dyson ?
do you have bandages ?	in the bathroom . danny , can you get them for us ?
my god .	now listen to me very carefully .
look , whatever you want me to do , i 'll do . i just want my kids to have a chance to grow up , okay ?	no one must follow your work .
no good .	let me try mine .
now do n't take this the wrong way , but you are a terminator , right ?	yes . cyberdyne systems , model 101 .
holy shit ... you 're really real ! i mean ... whoah ! you 're , uh ... like a machine underneath , right ... but sort of alive outside ?	i 'm a cybernetic organism . living tissue over a metal endoskeleton .
this in intense . get a grip , john . okay , uh ... you 're not here to kill me ... i figured that part out for myself . so what 's the deal ?	my mission is to protect you .
yeah ? who sent you ?	you did . thirty years from now you reprogrammed me to be your protector here , in this time .
so this other guy ? he 's a terminator too , right , like you ?	not like me . a t-1000 . advanced prototype . a mimetic polyalloy .
what does that mean ?	liquid metal .
radical .	you are targeted for termination . the t-1000 will not stop until it complete its mission . ever .
where we going ?	we have to leave the city , immediately . and avoid the authorities .
can i stop by my house ?	negative . the t-1000 will definitely try to reacquire you there .
you sure ?	i would .
i 'm right here . i 'm fine . what 's the dog 's name ?	max .
i need a minute here , okay ? you 're telling me it can imitate anything it touches ?	anything it samples by physical contact .
like it could disguise itself as anything ... a pack of cigarettes ?	no . only an object of equal size .
well , why does n't become a bomb or something to get me ?	it ca n't form complex machines . guns and explosives have chemicals , moving parts . it does n't work that way . but it can form solid metal shapes .
we spent a lot of time in nicaragua ... places like that . for a while she was with this crazy ex-green beret guy , running guns . then there were some other guys . she 'd shack up with anybody she could learn from . so then she could teach me how to be this great military leader . then she gets busted and it 's like ... sorry kid , your mom 's a psycho . did n't you know ? it 's like ... everything i 'd been brought up to believe was just made-up fantasy , right ? i hated her for that . but everything she said was true . we got ta get her out of there .	negative . the t-1000 's highest probability for success now would be to copy sarah connor and wait for you to make contact with her .
typically , the subject being copied is terminated .	terminated ! ? shit ! why did n't you tell me ? we got ta right now !
negative . she is not a mission priority .	yeah , well fuck you , she 's a priority to me !
oww ! why 'd you do that ?	you told me to .
you have to do what i say ? !	that is one of my mission parameters .
jesus ... you were gon na kill that guy !	of course . i 'm a terminator .
listen to me , very carefully , okay ? you 're not a terminator any more . alright ? you got that ? you ca n't just go around killing people !	why ?
whattaya mean , why ? 'cause you ca n't !	why ?
now remember , you 're not gon na kill anyone , right ?	right .
swear .	what ?
everything .	cool .
does it hurt ?	i sense injuries . the data could be called pain .
how long do you live ? i mean , last ?	a hundred and twenty years on my existing power cell .
affirmative .	no , no , no . you got ta listen to the way people talk . see , you do n't say like `` affirmative '' or some shit like that . you say ... no problemo .
it someone comes off to you with an attitude , you say `` eat me '' ... if you wan na shine them on , it 's `` hasta la vista , baby '' .	`` hasta la vista , baby '' ?
yeah , or `` later , dickwad . '' or if someone gets upset you say `` chill out . '' like that . or you can do combinations .	chill out , dickwad .
that 's great ! see , you 're getting it .	no problemo .
and that 's another thing . you could lighten up a bit , yourself . this severe routine is getting old . smile once in a while .	smile ?
we 're not gon na make it , are we ? people , i mean .	it is in your nature to destroy yourselves .
excellent .	yeah , i thought you 'd like this place .
not even of dying ?	no .
you do n't feel any emotion about it one way or the other ?	no . i have to stay functional until my mission is complete . then it does n't matter .
torque wrench please .	here . i wish i coulda met my real dad .
you will .	yeah . i guess so . my mom says when i 'm , like , 45 , i think , i send him back through time to 1984. but right now he has n't even been born yet . man , is messes with your head . where 's that other bolt ? thanks . mom and him were only together for one night , but she still loves him , i guess . i see her crying sometimes . she denies it totally , of course . like she says she got something in her eye .
why do you cry ?	you mean people ? i do n't know . we just cry . you know . when it hurts .
pain causes it ?	uh-unh , no , it 's different ... it 's when there 's nothing wrong with you but you hurt anyway . you get it ?
alriight ! ! my man !	no problemo .
`` no fate . '' no fate but what we make . my father told her this ... i mean i made him memorize it , up in the future , as a message to her -- never mind . okay , the whole thing goes `` the future is not set . there is no fate but what we make for ourselves . ''	she intends to change the future somehow .
i guess , yeah -- oh shit ! !	dyson .
this is tactically dangerous .	drive faster .
the t-1000 has the same files that i do . it could anticipate this move and reacquire you at dyson 's house .	i do n't care . we 've got ta stop her .
killing dyson might actually prevent the war .	i do n't care ! ! there 's got ta be another way . have n't you learned anything ? ! have n't you figured out why you ca n't kill people ?
i 'll deal with the police .	remember what i said , you ca n't ...
drive for a minute .	where you going ? !
we do n't have much time .	what ?
is it dead ?	terminated .
will it melt in there ?	yes . throw it in .
no !	i 'm sorry , john .
no , no no ! ! it 'll be okay . stay with us !	i have to go away , john .
it must end here ... or i am the future .	i order you not to !
your foster parents are kinda dicks , right ?	gim me that phillips right there .
easy money !	where 'd you learn all this stuff ?
so she 's pretty cool , huh ?	actually , no , she 's a complete psycho . that 's why she 's up at pescedero . she tries to blow up a computer factory , but she got shot and arrested .
no shit ?	yeah , she 's a total loser . c'mon , let 's check out the 7-eleven , whatya say ?
out of the way , john !	no ! do n't kill him !
it , john . not him . it .	alright , it ! we need it !
we 're better off by ourselves .	but it 's the only proof we have to the future ... about the war and all that .
i do n't trust it ! these things are hard to kill , john , believe me , i know . we may never have this opportunity again .	look , mom , if i 'm supposed to ever be this great leader , you should start listening to my leadership ideas once in a while . 'cause if you wo n't , nobody else will .
yeah . drag , huh ?	i need to know how skynet get built . who 's responsible ?
mom ? you okay ?	i could n't ... oh , god . you ... came here ... to stop me ?
it 's okay . it 'll by okay . we 'll figure it out .	i love you , john . i always have .
yeah . right . how were you supposed to know ? fucking men ... all you know how to do is thrust into the world with your ... fucking ideas and your weapons . did you know that every gun in the world is named after a man ? colt , browning , smith , thompson , kalashnikov ... all men . men built the hydrogen bomb , not women ... men like you thought it up . you 're so creative . you do n't know what it 's like to really create something ... to create a life . to feel it growing inside you . all you know how to create is death ... you fucking bastards .	mom , mom , we need to be more constructive here . i do n't see this as a gender-related issue . she 's still tense . we still have to figure out how to stop it all from happening . right ?
i got it . piece of cake .	go ! i 'll finish here .
ready to rock ?	ready .
john , get out of the way ! !	shoot ! ! ! !
i know . this is a dream , sarah .	oh . yeah . they ... make me take this stuff ...
i love you . i always will .	oh , god ... kyle . i need you so much .
they took him from me .	it 's john who 's the target now . you have to protect him . he 's wide open .
i know !	do n't quit , sarah . our son need you .
i know , but i 'm not as strong as i 'm supposed to be . i ca n't do it . i 'm screwing up the mission .	remember the message ... the future is not set . there is not fate but what we make for ourselves .
kyle , do n't go !	there 's not much time left in the world , sarah .
it has helped me a lot to have a goal , something to look forward to .	and what it that ?
you said i could be transferred to the minimum security wing and have visitors if i showed improvement in six months . well , it 's been six months , and i was looking forward to seeing my son .	i see . let 's go back to what you were saying about these terminator machines . now you think they do n't exist ?
but you 've told me on many occasions about how you crushed one in a hydraulic press .	if i had , there would have been some evidence . they would have found something at the factory .
so what do you think , doctor ? i 've shown a lot of improvement , have n't i ?	you see , sarah ... here 's the problem . i know how smart you are , and i think you 're just telling me what i want to hear . i do n't think you really believe who you 've been telling me today .
you broke my arm !	there 's 215 bones in the human body , motherfucker . that 's one . now do n't move !
you 're already dead , silberman . everybody here dies . you know i believe that . so do n't fuck with me !	open the goddamn door !
this t-1000 ... what happens when you shoot it ?	ballistic penetration shocks it , but only for a few seconds .
can it be destroyed ?	unknown .
you look like handmade shit .	so do you .
i 'll bet . makes you a more efficient killer , right ?	correct .
my cpu is a neural-net processor ... a learning computer . but skynet presets the switch to `` read-only '' when we are sent out alone .	does n't want you thinking too much , huh ?
the man most directly responsible is miles bennet dyson , director of special projects at cyberdyne systems corporation .	why him ?
in a few months he creates a revolutionary type of mircoprocessor .	then what ?
in three years cyberdyne will become the largest supplier of military computer systems . all stealth bombers are upgraded with cyberdyne computers , becoming fully unmanned , afterward , the fly with a perfect operational record .	uh huh , great . then those fat fucks in washington figure , what the hell , let a computer run the whole show , right ?
basically . the skynet funding bill is passed . the system goes on-line august 4th , 1997. human decisions are removed from strategic defense . skynet begins to learn , at a geometric rate . it becomes self-aware at 2:14 a.m. eastern time , august 29. in a panic , they try to pull the plug .	and skynet fights back .
yes . it launches its icbms against their targets in russia .	why attack russia ?
because skynet knows the russian counter-strike will remove its enemies here .	jesus . how much do you know about dyson ?
i have detailed files .	i want to know everything . what he looks like . where he lives . everything .
the cpu from the first terminator .	son of a bitch , i knew it !
i must be destroyed .	can you get us in there , past security ?
is it safe for them here ?	take your kids . go to a hotel . right now . do n't pack . let 's go .
it 's finally over .	no . there is another chip .
are you afraid ?	yes .
... it 's ... like a giant strobe light , burning right through my eyes ... but somehow i can still see . look , you know the dream 's the same every night , why do i have to --	please continue ...
it 's not just a dream . it 's real , you moron ! i know the date is happens ! !	i 'm sure it feels very real to you --
on august 29th 1997 it 's going to feel pretty fucking real to you , too ! anybody not wearing number two million sunblock in gon na have a real bad day , get it ?	relax now , sarah --
where do you stand on all this ?	on all what ?
on furtwngler .	i do n't know .
you represent the united states now . we have a moral duty to be just and we have to be seen to be just .	major arnold believes he has a moral duty , too .
that 's because you had a proper upbringing .	that 's right . i was raised very strictly . so do n't speak before you are spoken to !
oh ! and do n't wave your hands about !	respect your elders and your betters !
and no elbows on the table !	eating is eating ... and ...
and talking is talking ! well , i think we better get on .	right . so , this is going to be very formal , too , now . lieutenant david wills requests die pleasure of die company of fraulein emmi straube at dinner any night she cares .
what does he mean , too correct ?	i do n't know .
do n't see me to my door , there 's no need .	but i promised your mother .
yesterday i read that furtwngler was asked to lead the new york philharmonic back in '36 , toscanini suggested it . had he accepted , he would have become the most celebrated conductor in america .	when he made his decision , he could n't have known everything . especially not the way people like you do , who 've returned from exile and feel that you have a right to pass judgement . because you are blameless , you think you know best who is a sinner and who deserves forgiveness . but you have no idea how people lived here .
when he met hitler at his birthday and shook hands with him , was he pleased ?	i do n't know . but you and i already know that he has saved lives .
'please remember that dr. furtwngler risked his life to help anyone who asked him . i personally testify to having seen literally hundreds of people lined up outside his dressing room after concerts to ask for his help . he never turned anyone away . after he heard me play ... i am a violinist ... he gave me money because i was unable to feed myself or my family and then he helped me to escape to sweden . he helped countless people in similar ways . '	and this , only one of these letters , major . i have lots of them .
lieutenant wills reporting to major arnold . sir .	for chrissakes i hate that shit , cut it out .
i 'm very sorry .	i 'm steve . what 's your name ?
david . david wills . i 'm your liaison officer with the allied kommandatura cultural affairs committee . sir .	sounds a lot of run . so they sent the big guns to check up on me . we recruiting children now ?
i guess so , sir .	you call me sir again and i 'll make you listen to beethoven .
where you from , david ?	was born here , in leipzig . i escaped in '36 . my parents , they sent me to my uncle in philadelphia . they were to follow . but they delayed and ...
i guess you admire musicians .	some .
you think a whole orchestra , what , a hundred and forty or so guys , could be orchestrated ?	i guess it 's possible .
so , what does the russki want ?	colonel dymshitz asked specially to see you .
what the hell are they doing ?	they 're trying to sort out some of the works of art the nazis stole from occupied territories . who really owns what ? that 's colonel dymshitz , on the far side .
david , need to ask you something . you heard this rumour the british found something called the hinkel archive ?	yes .
so what is it ?	the british occupy the building where this guy , hinkel , ran the nazi ministry of culture and it seems they 've ... they 've discovered his secret archive .
what 's that mean ?	i do n't know , but the british are excited about it , i know that . the rumour is hinkel kept a file on every artist working in the third reich .
jeez . and you think the british 'll share it with their allies ?	major richards said he 'd call to let us know .
okay , better question the next witness . i bet you a bottle of french champagne he tells us the baton story inside ten minutes .	five minutes .
you have a question for helmuth , david ?	yes . what was the orchestra 's reaction when they asked you to play for hitler 's birthday ?
yes , david ?	why not show dr. furtwngler the evidence . it may refresh his memory ?
you see , wilhelm , i 'm talking about ordinary , everyday reasons . which is why i want to discuss your private life . how many illegitimate children do you have ?	major , i do n't see how this line of questioning could ...
is n't it true that before every concert you got a woman in your dressing room and gave her the old conductor 's baton , is n't that true ?	major , this is deeply offensive and repugnant !
you bet .	and totally irrelevant .
major , that 's not a good argument . if dr. furtwngler did indeed enjoy all these ... these privileges , he enjoyed them because of who he is and what he is . that 's true of any leading artist in any country in the world .	but it still does n't make them saints . they still have to get up and piss in the middle of the night , do n't they ? they can still be vindictive and envious and mean just like you and me . well , just like me . ca n't they ?
what ?	your manner .
can i ask you a favour , major ?	yeah .
when you question him again , could you treat him with more respect ?	with more what ? more what ?
major , he may just be the greatest conductor of this century and that merits respect .	david , i do n't understand a thing about you . you 're a jew . are you a jew ?
yes , i 'm a jew . but i like to think first i 'm a human being .	a human being , oh , good , i 'm relieved , i thought you were going to say you were a music lover . this man , this great artist has made anti-semitic remarks like you would n't believe . i got letters .
major , show me someone who has n't made an anti-semitic remark and i 'll show you the gates of paradise .	what is it with you , david ? where are your feelings ? where 's your hatred , your disgust ? where 's your fucking outrage , david ?
hello , major , my name is dymshitz . i 'm glad to see you .	colonel . pleasure .
so , major , tell me , have you questioned dr. furtwngler ?	not yet .
i was in vienna . i had with me an austrian chauffeur , max his name was , he spent time in the camps . we were looking at these viennese cleaning up the bomb damage , scavenging for rotting food , butt ends , anything . i said , 'to think a million of these people came out to welcome adolf on the day he entered the city , a million of 'em , and now look at 'em . ' and max said , 'oh , not these people , major . these people were all at home hiding jews in their attics . ' you get the point , colonel ? the point is they 're all full of shit .	furtwngler 's in a different category .
a great artist will have great privileges in a russian zone .	that 's why he did n't get the hell out of here when he had the chance ! i put that to him , he could n't answer . why did n't he go and direct in america , like that italian , toscanini .
colonel . he had no sisters , no brothers , only a lot of love affairs .	anyway , major , why should he leave his country , his mother tongue , his family , his history , his past , his future , just because now , suddenly , there is a dictatorship ? why ?
but what ... before that turns rotten ... what if they surround the space with barbed wire , colonel ?	do n't talk about things you know nothing about . he was in a dictatorship !
yeah , yeah , art and politics , yeah , yeah , i heard all about that .	in a dictatorship , art belongs to the party . if you want to be a conductor , you have to have an orchestra . and you can only get an orchestra if you have contact with the power . all over the world you need the right contacts and you have to make the right compromises .
this is what i 'm saying . he must have had party contacts .	there are good party members who help , and there are dirty non-party members who inform on you . of course , they gave him privileges .
and suddenly , steve , suddenly you notice that they like you . they honour you , suddenly you are the director of the best museum in the world , for example .	what museum ?
i 'm sorry . museum ? not ... i said orchestra . sorry . believe me . help me , steve . you say you answer for someone from high up . i , too , have orders from high up . very high up . we want furtwngler . i 'll give you in return the whole orchestra , four , five conductors . i need him , steve .	no can do .
let furtwngler go . please .	i have a duty .
i 'm gon na get that fucking bandleader , colonel . no deal . no fucking deal .	then you 're going to kill me .
you live here , in berlin ?	yes .
you do shorthand and typing ?	yes .
okay , let 's see . how long were you in the camp for ?	three months .
says here because of your father . what 's that mean ?	my father was one of the officers in the plot against hitler . they arrested the plotters and their families .
your mother , too .	yes . she suffered longer . she was in ravensbruck .
steve .	there have been messages for you . a lieutenant david wills called from the allied kommandatura cultural affairs office in wiesbaden . i do n't know who he is .
think you can get me any of that ?	oh yes , major , i have recordings of all his symphonies . i kept them safe during the bombing . my favourite is the seventh symphony .
mine 's the eleventh .	but ... he only wrote nine , major .
i 'm kidding , emmi . what about a record player ? you have that , too ?	no . ours was damaged .
what 's in those files ?	the names of the members of the berlin philharmonic orchestra since 1934 together with their questionnaires . major , what am i to tell dr. furtwngler ?
i 'm sorry .	come in , emmi , this is your office , too . emmi , this is lieutenant david wills .
major , major ... he 's here ...	shut the door , emmi . sit down , emmi . we 're going to keep him waiting , too .
bruckner 's seventh , major .	do you know where the adagio begins ?
of course .	put it on ready to play , and i 'll tell you when to play it .
i 'm sorry but i have to leave . i 'll find other work . you 'll have to get someone else , that 's all .	what is this , emmi ?
i ca n't do this . it 's not right .	what 's not right ?
i have been questioned by the gestapo just like that . just like you questioned him .	emmi , stop ! i want to show you something . let me show you something and then if you want to leave , you can leave , please please . his friends , they did this . and he gave them birthday concerts .
but he had no idea , a lot of people had no idea . i only realised what was really going on when i got arrested .	if he had no idea , why did the jews need saving ? this is the question , emmi , to all germans : why did the jews need saving in this country ? why , if people had no idea ?
i want you to understand why you 're here . you 're automatically banned from public life under control council directive no 24. we 're here to look into your case before you appear in front of the tribunal for artists of the denazification commission . you understand that ?	i have already been cleared by a denazification tribunal in austria .
what they do in austria does n't interest me one little bit . okay ? i have your questionnaire here , gustav heinrich ernst martin wilhelm furtwngler , born berlin , january 1886. orchestral conductor . and you say here you were never a member of the nazi party .	that is correct .
could you tell us about being made a prussian privy councillor . how did that happen to a non-party member ?	i received a telegram from hermann goering informing me that he had made me a privy councillor . i was not given the opportunity either to accept or refuse . after the dreadful events of november 1938 , the violent attacks on the jews , i stopped using the title .
what about vice-president of the chamber of music , you used that title did n't you ? but then i suppose you had no choice there either , because i suppose dr. goebbels just sent you a telegram saying , dear mr. vice-president .	i do n't think dr. goebbels sent me a telegram . i was simply told . in a letter , i believe . i do n't remember exactly .
goebbels and goering were sure heaping honours on you . one makes you a privy councillor , the other makes you vice-president of the chamber of music , and you were n't even a member of the party , how do you explain that ?	well , there was a constant battle between goering and goebbels as to which of them would control german culture . i was simply a pawn . anyway , i resigned from the musikkammer at the same time i resigned as musical director of the berlin philharmonic orchestra . in 1934 .
then why did you conduct at one of their nuremberg rallies ?	i did not conduct at at the rally , i conducted on the evening before the rally .
that sounds like the small print in one of our insurance policies , wilhelm . and what about april 19 , 1942 ? the eve of hitler 's fifty- third birthday , the big celebration ; you conducted for hitler , did n't you ? was that in keeping with your view that art and politics have nothing to do with each other ?	that ... that was a different matter , i ... i was tricked .
how come ?	could i have a glass of water , please ? please , fraulein ?
i made no deal !	i do n't buy that .
i keep hearing you helped a lot of jews to escape . how did you do that ?	i do n't remember in detail , there were so many .
did you call someone you knew ?	i may have , as ... as i said , i simply do n't remember .
or maybe you called goebbels or goering ? you were so close you were in the same shithouse as them .	may i ask a question ?
sure .	when will my case be heard by the tribunal ?
your guess is as good as mine .	i need to work . i need to make my living . i live off the generosity of friends ...
tough , tough !	then why is it , please , that another conductor who was actually a member of the party , who used to play the horst wessel before his concerts , has already been cleared and is working again while i have to wait and wait and wait ?
i do n't know , he was n't my case . why did you escape to switzerland just before the war ended ?	it was because i learned that the gestapo was about to arrest me .
why were they going to arrest you ?	i believe it was because of another letter i 'd written to goebbels lamenting the decline of musical standards due to racial policies .
so , how did you learn that the gestapo was out to get you ?	during an enforced hour-long interval because of a power failure at a concert here in berlin , albert speer , the minister of armaments , said to me , 'you look very tired dr. furtwngler , you should go abroad for a while . ' i knew exactly what he meant .
you sure knew a lot of people in high places .	it would be truer to say , i think , that a lot of people in high places knew me .
you were real close to all of them , to adolf , to hermann , to joseph , to baldur , and now albert , so , let 's hear the truth , let 's come clean . what was your party number ?	if you are going to bully me like this , major , you had better do your homework . you obviously have no idea how impertinent and stupid your questions are .
i have a list of names here , people in your profession , who got out in '33 . bruno walter , otto klemperer , arnold schoenberg , max reinhardt ...	they were jews , they had to leave . they were right to leave . i could not leave my country in her deepest misery . after all , i am a german . i ... i stayed in my homeland . is that my sin in your eyes ?
steve arnold ...	i 've had enough of this , i 'm leaving .
i 've got to hand it to the british , david . you know what those guys are ? decent . tell me , herr dr. furtwngler , do you know hans hinkel ?	yes , a despicable human being . he was in the ministry of culture . his job was to get rid of jews in the arts .
yup , that 's him , that 's the guy . you know what else the little creep did ? he kept files , close on 250,000 files . and you know what 's in those files ?	certainly not , but i knew he had informers everywhere . even in my orchestra there was someone
who ?	i was n't told . i just knew it .
how ?	i was warned .
who warned you ?	goering . because hinkel was working for goebbels .
what did goering say ?	he told me to be careful as one of goebbels ' men was watching me . he read a report on me - everything i said was quoted word by word .
it is now nine o'clock precisely . i do not intend to be kept waiting again .	do n't talk to me like i was a second violinist . go back into the waiting room . miss straube will come and get you when i am ready to see you .
if it 's too hot , open your tie .	i wish to say something .
when i last saw you , i was unprepared . i did not know what to expect . in these past weeks , i have been thinking more carefully and making some notes . you have to understand who i am and what i am . i am a musician and i believe in music . i am an artist and i believe in art . art in general , and music , in particular , has for me mystical powers which nurture man 's spiritual needs . i must confess , however , to being extremely naive . i insisted for many years on the absolute separation of art and politics . my entire life was devoted to music because , and this is very important , because i thought that i could , through music , do something practical .	and what was that ?
maintain liberty , humanity and justice .	gee , that 's a thing of beauty , honest to god , a real thing of beauty . i 'm going to try to remember that . liberty , humanity and justice . beautiful . but you used the word 'naive ' . are you now saying you think you were wrong ? that art and politics ca n't be separated ?
i believe art and politics should be separate , but that they were n't kept separate i learned to my cost .	and when did you first learn that - when you sent the telegram ? was that the surrender signal , the waving of the white flag ?
what telegram ?	'happy birthday , dear adolf , love wilhelm . ' or words to that effect . that sounds to me like you were dropping on your knees and saying , 'okay , adolf , you win . you 're the number one man . have a swell party . '
i have no idea what you 're talking about .	the birthday greetings you sent to your old pal , adolf hider .
i never sent him any birthday greetings or any other kind of greetings .	think carefully , wilhelm ... maybe not in your own name , but as privy councillor or vice-president .
you wo n't find it because no such telegram exists .	well , i tried , you got to admit i tried . i thought i might just trap you there , wilhelm , but david here was too quick for me . smart move , david , smart move . no , i do n't have the telegram , but i know it exists . and i want you to know , wilhelm , we 're going to keep looking for it because i believe you sent it .
then you are wrong .	art and politics , yeah , art and politics . let 's look at that . you and the berlin philharmonic toured the third reich , played in countries the nazis had conquered . are you saying that conducting in occupied territories from 1939 on was n't a commercial for adolf and all he stood for ?
we never , never officially represented the regime when we played abroad . we always performed as a private ensemble . as i think i already told you , i was a freelance conductor .	you know something ? you should 've written our insurance policies for us because you got more exclusion clauses than double indemnity . what do you imagine people thought ? the berlin philharmonic 's taken over by doctor goebbels and his propaganda ministry but wilhelm is a freelance , so art and politics are now entirely separate ? is that what you believed ordinary people thought ?
have no idea what ordinary people thought .	no !
no , because i had only one intention . my only intention whatever i did was to show that music means more than politics .	tell me about von der null .
von der null ?	yes , von der null .
von der null ?	how long 's this going to go on , wilhelm ? i say von der null , you say von der null , i say von der null , you say von der null , we could go on all day . you know who von der null is , do n't you ? edwin von der nuell , music critic .
yes , i know who he is .	is n't it true that because he gave you bad reviews and praised this young guy , von karajan , called him a goddamn miracle , said he was a better conductor than you , then you had von der null conscripted into the army and no one 's heard from him since ?
that 's an outrageous lie !	you sure you did n't call one of your close buddies and say , god in heaven , did you see what that guy von der null wrote about me ? the greatest conductor on earth . i want him out the way . he had the nerve to accuse me i am not playing enough modern music . send him to stalingrad . is n't that what you did ? you do n't like criticism , do you , wilhelm ? you surely did n't like them saying there was another conductor who was better than you ... are you saying the name von der null was never mentioned in your talks with goebbels ?
well . once he said he 'd read what this man wrote about me .	and what did he say ?
he said , 'do n't mind him . his job is to criticise , your job is to conduct . '	and what happened to von der nul ?
i have no idea .	you 've really no idea ? i 'll tell you what happened . he died in stalingrad .
i 'm sorry .	now , that young conductor what 's his name ? that miracle kid , you know who i mean . von karajan ! but you called him something else . c'mon . what did you call von karajan ?
please stop playing these games with me . why you should bring up the name of another conductor is beyond my understanding .	i 'll tell you why . you remember we talked about you playing for hitler 's birthday ? and you told me that goebbels got to your doctors first , that you were tricked ?
come on , admit it . k worried you , did n't he ? he always worried you . in 1942 , he 's thirty-four years old , you 're already fifty-six . and goebbels and goering keep saying to you , 'if you do n't do it , little k will . ' never mind art and politics and symbols and airy-fairy bullshit about liberty , humanity and justice because i do n't care how great you are . it 's the oldest story in the book , the ageing romeo jealous of the young buck . the real reason you did n't leave the country when you knew you should have was that you were frightened that , once you were out of the way , you 'd be supplanted by the miracle kid , the party 's boy twice over , flashy , talented little k .	this is absolute nonsense !
well , i 'm just beginning to develop my theme . is n't that what you call it in classical music , developing your theme ? okay , so they played on your insecurity . that 's human , understandable . but , there is one guy who does n't like little k as much as he likes you - yeah , the number one man your old pal , adolf . he thinks you 're the greatest , and when he says , i want wilhelm for my birthday , boy , they better go out get wilhelm . so , josef calls and threatens you with little k. and you said to hell with the ninth in vienna , i 'll give it to adolf as a birthday present in berlin . that 's the trick they played , they got you by the balls and they squeezed . hard . why did you stay ? why did you play for them ? why were you the flag-carrier for their regime ? jealousy ?	of course there was a conspiracy against me , a campaign - even abroad .
i have illegitimate children .	what ?
i said i have illegitimate children . i do n't know how many .	you like the women , do n't you , wilhelm ?
stop this , please , stop this now !	no , i 'm not going to stop it . hitler himself offered you a beautiful house and a personal bomb shelter .
i absolutely refused the house and the bomb shelter .	but you see what i 'm getting at ? you get a gorgeous house , you 're highly paid . what are you gon na do , stay or leave ? one voice comes back at me : stay !
okay , wilhelm , go home now . go home and think about these past twelve years .	i do n't understand what you mean .
everybody says what a great benefactor you were to the jews . but -- i have things here you said and wrote . listen to this : 'the jew composer schonberg is admired by the jewish international . ' and what about this : 'jewish musicians lack a genuine affinity with our music . ' 'jewish musicians are good businessmen with few scruples , lacking roots . ' you deny you said these things ?	those attitudes do not exist in me .
i believe that . but just answer the question , do n't give me explanations .	speaking to party members i used their language , of course i did , everyone did .
do you know what that is ?	of course i know what that is .
okay , so what is it ?	bruckner 's seventh . the adagio .
how can i know such a thing ?	i 'll tell you , then . the last time this music was played on these air waves was after they announced that your pal hitler had shot himself . listen to it . they listen . did they pick little k 's recording ? did they pick some other conductor ? no , they picked you , and why ? because you represented them so beautifully . when the devil died , they wanted his bandleader to conduct the funeral march . you were everything to them .
have you ever smelled burning flesh ? i smelt it four miles away . four miles away , i smelt it . have you ever seen the gas chambers , the crematoria ? have you seen the mounds of rotting corpses ? you talk to me about culture , art and music ? you putting that in the scales , wilhelm ? you setting culture , art and music against the millions put to death by your pals ? they had orchestras in the camps . they played beethoven , wagner . the hangmen were playing chamber music at home with their families . i do n't understand the germans ' relationship with music . what do you need music for ? your pals you could call to save a few jews when millions of them were being annihilated ? yes , i blame you for not getting hanged , i blame you for your cowardice . you strutted and swaggered , you fucking piece of shit , king-pin in a shithouse . you talk to me about walking a tightrope between exile and the gallows , and i say to you , lies !	i love my country , i believe in music , what was i to do ?
helmuth alfred rode . second violinist since 1935. what 's it mean , second violinist ?	it means i was n't good enough to be a first violinist .
good , and according to your questionnaire , helmuth , you never joined the nazi party .	me ? never . never .
is it true you 're going to interview dr. furtwngler today ?	i 'll ask the questions , helmuth .
oh , we did n't play for his birthday , we played the evening before - it was the 19th of april not the 20th .	do you know hans hinkel ?
do i know hans hinkel ?	that 's what i asked .
do i know hans hinkel ?	you seem to understand the question , now how about answering it ?
i hear the british have his ... his archive , files , records .	do you know what 's in this archive ?
major .	helmuth .
guess what i am holding in my hand . you like guessing games ?	love 'em , helmuth . i give up . what are you holding in your hand ?
it 's dr. furtwngler 's baton , which i stole .	the one he kept in his right hand . yes , you remember .
yes , you remember .	how could i forget ?
show me .	show you ?
yeah , show me , i want to see you do it . pretend i 'm adolf . you 're the maestro , and you have the baton in your right hand , but you give me the salute just the same .	not here , major , there are people , if anybody should see ... please , please , major ...
and i see what you mean . you nearly poked my eyes out .	exactly . replaces the baton , gives steve the case .
great catch , kid . the boy runs off .	so . you wanted to see me .
you usually do n't work on sunday , major ?	all in the cause of humanity , helmuth . or should i call you one- zero-four-nine-three-three-one ?
what ?	one-zero-four-nine-three-three- one . or d'you mind if i just call you 'one ' ?
was a member of ... ? speak up ?	i was a member of the communist party . i was a communist . that 's what hinkel had over me . he knew everything . he held that over me . that 's how he made me co-operate .
oh , i see , he made you co-operate . and now are you a communist again ?	you do n't know what it 's like to wake up every single morning of your life terrified , you do n't know that -
i can give you freedom of movement , freedom to work , freedom , helmuth . but i need something in return .	major , we 're discussing a man of genius , i do n't want ...
the only thing i know is he 's an anti-semite .	of course . you , too . like everyone else in this goddamn country .
i 've remembered something else ...	yeah ?
furtwngler sent hitler a telegram for his birthday .	he did ?
one of your people told me .	one of my people ?
yes . a corporal . us army . a jew . he said he 'd seen the telegram in the chancellery .	son-of-a-gun . we 'll find the corporal and we 'll find the telegram .
but i need documentary proof . you know of anything like that ?	no . but that 's why we hated him . we admired him as a conductor but we all hated him too because he did n't have to join the party and yet he had a better life than any of us . he did n't have to go and deliver a report after every trip abroad . he got everything from them , everything . he was filthier than any of us party members .
there 's a rumour ... i do n't know if it 's true or not ... but ask him about von der null .	never heard of him , who is he ?
edwin von der null . music critic . he gave furtwngler terrible reviews while he raved about herbert von karajan .	who 's he ?
also a conductor . very brilliant . young . von der null called him 'the miracle von karajan ' . furtwngler was outraged and they say he had von der null conscripted into the army . the same thing happened to another critic . true or not , it 's not such a bad idea . critics give you bad reviews , you have them sent to the russian front . but if you really want to get furtwngler , ask him about herbert von karajan .	the miracle kid .
and ask him about his private life .	his private life ?
goebbels , yes , josef goebbels said , 'there 's not a single filthy jew left in germany on whose behalf dr. furtwngler has not intervened . ' no , no one could have been less of a nazi than dr. furtwngler .	but this was the same guy who conducted for adolf on his birthday .
oh ! the evening before , i see ...	yes , dr. furtwngler was absolutely clear about this : politics and art must be kept separate .
you ever seen adolf hitler 's eyes when he was making a speech ? i 've seen 'em on films .	yes .
was looking at furtwngler like that ?	i do n't know what you mean , major .
so , you never heard of him .	nope .
do you know who arturo toscanini is ?	sure .
he 's as big as toscanini , maybe even bigger . in this neck of the woods , he 's probably bob hope and betty grable rolled into one .	jeez , and i never heard of him .
you were in insurance before the war .	right . claims assessor .
conscientious , determined , dogged .	they said i was dogged ?
well , they say here that when you went on a case , you stayed on it . now we ca n't take every nazi in this country to trial , although i would like to ; it 's an impossibility . so we 're going for the big boys in industry , education , law , culture .	like this bandleader .
rudolf otto werner . wind section since 1936. what instrument did you play ?	first oboe .
i have your questionnaire here . it says you were never a member of the nazi party .	absolutely not .
no , i was never a nazi , i have no interest in politics , i 'm a musician -	hey , hey , slow up , fraulein straube has to take down what you say .
dr. furtwngler is a great musician . he actively opposed the nazis and later on he helped many jews to escape .	then how do you explain him being made a prussian privy councillor ?
it was hermann goering . i was told he just made the maestro his privy councillor , no questions asked . although dr. furtwngler stood up to him . and to dr. goebbels .	he also conducted for hitler , did n't he ?
yes , that 's true , but he refused to give the nazi salute . he kept his baton in his right hand . in hitler 's presence . that was a brave act ...	brave ? to celebrate hitler 's birthday with some heroic piece by wagner but without the nazi salute ? bravo .
it was beethoven 's ninth .	do you really think it was brave ? did n't he bow to him and shake his hand ?
yes , chuck ?	come to the office , please .
mission control to chuck , come in ...	you 're late .
are n't i worth waiting for ?	not really . do you think you can get here on time if i put you on the floor as a waitress ?
i do n't know . i kinda had my heart set on being a cashier the rest of my life .	the pay 's the same but you 'll make more in tips .
mmm . same schedule 's okay .	alright !
can you handle it ?	it 's not brain surgery , chuck .
here you go . you 're a bob 's girl now . nancy will check you out .	i wo n't let the fat kid down .
anything else ?	a phased plasma pulse-laser in the forty watt range ...
the uzi 9 millimeter .	you know your weapons , buddy .
any one of them 's ideal for home defense . which 'll it be ?	all .
you ca n't to that ...	wrong .
i had him hooked . he was just about to ask me out . i could tell .	that guy 's a jerk . i did you a favor .
what do you think ?	great .
great .	you 're a big help .
alright , the beige one .	i hate the beige one .
not lately . did you check messages ?	i thought you did .
that bum . so what if he has a porsche , he ca n't treat you like that ... it 's friday night for crissakes .	
i 'm going to a movie , kiddo . see ya ' . you and matt have a good time .	we will , kiddo .
i have n't seen you in here lately , mr. miller .	what 's it to ya ?
you must have a girlfriend .	that 's none of your business .
compared to me she is . how come you 're not at the cash anymore ? they catch ya steal- ing ?	what 's it to ya ?
do you understand ?	yes . do n't hurt me .
this is a mistake . i have n't done anything .	no . but you will . it 's very important that you live .
but outside , it 's living human tissue . flesh , skin , hair ... blood . grown for the cyborgs .	look , reese , i know you want to help , but ...
pay attention . the 600 series had rubber skin . we spotted them easy . but these are new . they look human . sweat , bad breath , everything . very hard to spot . i had to wait 'til he moved on you before i could zero him .	hey , i 'm not stupid , y'know . they ca n't build anything like that yet .
so , it 's from the future , is that right ?	one possible future . four your point of view . i do n't know the tech stuff .
and you 're from the future too ?	right .
just let me go .	listen . understand . that terminator is out there . it ca n't be reasoned with , it ca n't be bargained with ... it does n't feel pity of remorse or fear ... and it absolutely will not stop . ever . until you are dead .
there 's so much ...	tell me . just start at the beginning .
-- everythingis gone . just gone . there were survivors . here . there . nobody knew who started it . it was the machines .	i do n't understand ...
did n't see the war . i was born after , in the ruins . grew up there . starving . hiding from the h-k 's .	the what ?
you cold ?	freezing .
reese ... you got a first name ?	kyle .
kyle , what 's it like when you go through time ?	white light . pain . like being ripped inside out ... slowly . like being born , maybe .
i caught one , back there .	caught one ? you mean you got shot ?
we got ta get you to a doctor .	it 's okay . forget it .
this is gon na make me puke . talk about something .	what ?
what 's he like ?	you trust him . he 's got that strength . you 'd die in a second for john .
well , at least i know what to name him . i do n't suppose you 'd know who the father is ? so i do n't tell him to get lost when i meet him .	john never said much about him . he dies . even before the war ...
stop ! i do n't want to know . hold still . so ... it was john that ordered you here ?	i volunteered .
you volunteered ?	it was an honor . a chance to meet the legend . sarah connor . who taught her son to fight ... organize , prepare . from when he was a kid . when you were in hiding , before the war .
i 'm sure .	come on , me ? the mother of the future ? am i tough ? organized ? i ca n't even balance my checkbook . i cry when i see a cat that 's been run over ... and i do n't even like cats .
ow ! no , it 's okay . it 's better tight .	and anyway , what do i know about guerrilla warfare ?
you 'll learn .	look , reese , i did n't ask for this honor and i do n't want it . any of it .
good field-dressing .	you like it ? it 's my first .
sleep . it 'll be light soon .	okay . talk some more .
about what ?	about where you 're from .
bag some z 's ?	let 's get cleaned up , kyle .
thanks a lot .	what 's that ?
that 's where we 're going .	why ?
look . i found it . is n't that it ? cyber dynamics corporation ?	what about it ?
did n't you say that they 're going to develop this revolutionary new thing ...	molecular-memory .
whatever ... they become the hotshot computer guys so they get the job to build el computer grande ... skynet ... for the government . right ?	that 's the way it was told to me .
well , we 're gon na uninvent the bastard . eighty-six it . we 'll blow up the place ... burn it down . something .	tactically dangerous . we lay low .
reese . think it through . we can prevent the war . nobody else is gon na do it . if we go to anybody official we wind up back in jail and then that walking cuisinart has got us again . we have to so it ourselves .	that 's not my mission .
let 's go . time to move out .	fuck you ! let go of me !
kyle ?	i 'm wrong here . i was n't meant to see this ...
is this enough ?	yes . and i do n't want to know where you got it .
i 'm dying for a shower . you could use one too . and we 'd better check that bandage .	later . i 'm going out for materiel . keep this .
what 's that ?	nitroglycerin , basically . bit more stable . i learned howto make it when i was a kid .
make sure there 's none on the threads , like this . now screw the end-cap on ... very gently .	you must have had a fun child-
that 's good . now , seven more like that while i make fuses .	i was thinking , there 's so much i 've got to show you when we get through this . it 's mind boggling , the pos- sibilities ... disneyland , the beach , movies ... matinees with popcorn and foot-long hot dogs ...
hot dogs ?	i want to buy you a hot dog so bad , kyle ... all the things you 've never seen and done . you 're here , but wherever you go , and whatever you touch , you bring the war with you .
my whole life has been combat .	i want it to be over for you .
not possible .	i want it to be over for me too . i feel like i slipped over some invisible line , that i 'm in your world now . everything 's the same , but i see it differently . it 's like , there 's you and me , and him ... but nobody else can understand or help or even touch us .
he 'll find us , wo n't he ?	probably . sarah , if i get zeroed ...
do n't say that .	if i do , you have to get away , disappear without a trace . different country , different name , everything . in case they send another one .
it 'll never be over , will it ? look at me , i 'm shaking . some legend , huh ? you must be pretty disappointed .	no . i 'm not .
kyle , the women in your time ... what were they like ?	good fighters .
that 's not what i meant . was there someone special ?	someone ?
a girl . you know .	no . never .
so much pain .	pain can be controlled . you disconnect it .
and so you feel nothing .	it 's better that way .
i 'm sorry . i should n't have said ...	kyle ...
i bet you 're ticklish .	ticklish ?
what are you doing ?	you 'll beg for mercy in a second .
i do n't think i like this .	you 're not supposed to .
sarah .	we did it , kyle . we got it .
what are you doing ?	cover ... our footsteps ...
so . you 're a soldier . fighting for whom ?	with the one thirty second under perry , from '21 to '27 --
and who was the enemy ?	skynet . a computer defense system built for sac-norad by cyber dynamics . a modified series 4800 .
i see . and this ... computer , thinks it can win by killing the mother of its enemy , kill- ing him , in effect , before he is even conceived ? a sort of retroactive abortion ?	yes .
... it had no choice . the defensive grid was smashed . we 'd taken the mainframes ... we 'd won . taking out connor then would make no difference . skynet had to wipe out his entire exist- ence . we captured the lab complex . found the ... what- ever it was called ... the time-displacement equipment . the terminator had already gone through . they sent two of us to intercept , then zeroed the whole place . sumner did n't make it .	then how are you supposed to get back ?
you go naked . something about the field generated by a living organism . nothing dead will go .	why ?
i did n't build the fucking thing .	okay . okay . but this ... cyborg ... if it 's metal ...
surrounded by living tissue .	of course .
why were the other two women killed ?	most official records were lost in the war . the computer knew almost nothing about connor 's mother . her name . where she lived , just the city . no scanner pictures . the terminator was just being systematic .
you 've heard enough . decide . are you going to release me ?	i 'm afraid that 's not up to me .
i can help you ...	who is in authority here ?
... look , lieutenant ... uh , vukovich , do n't put me on hold and do n't transfer me to another department ...	i wo n't . now just relax . where are you ? yeah , i know it ... on pico . are you alright ?
yes , but i do n't want to leave . i think this guy 's following me .	alright , ms. connor . listen carefully . you 're in a public place , you 'll be safe 'til we get there . stay visible . do n't go outside or in the restroom . i 'll be there in a few minutes .
here , drink some of this ...	lieutenant , are you sure it 's them ? maybe i should see the ... bodies .
sarah . sarah , this is dr. silber- man . i 'd like you to tell him everything reese said to you . do you feel up to it ?	i guess so . you 're a doctor ?
why do n't you just stretch out here and get some sleep . it 'll take your mom a good hour to get here from redlands .	i ca n't sleep .
go ahead . you 're safe . there 're thirty cops in this building .	okay .
give me the short version .	six shots at less than ten feet . weapon was a large caliber --
okay , let 's see ... got a pos- itive on her . she 's sarah connor , works as a legal --	that ca n't be right . that 's the name of the one valley division mopped up this after- noon .
here 's her driver 's license .	you got ta be kidding me . the new guys 'll be short-stroking it over this one . a one-day pattern killer .
that stuff 's two hours cold .	i know .
did you reach the next girl yet ?	no . keep getting an answer- ing machine .
send a unit .	i already did . no answer at the door and the apartment manager 's out . i 'm keeping them there .
call her .	i just called .
same shit .	i can hear it now , it 's gon na be the goddamned 'phone book killer ' .
i hate the press cases . especially the weird press cases . where you going ?	to make a statement . i 'm gon na give them the name . maybe the jackals can help us out for once .
if they can get this on the tube by eleven , she may just call us . how do i look ?	like shit , boss .
go ! go ! he 's got her .	suspect westbound on olympic . grey sedan . has hostage , repeat ...
that silberman just crack me up . he had this guy in here last week who set his afghan on fire . screwed it first , then set it on --	shut up .
you promised you 'd meet projections , alan . a dollar sixty per share you said . so , i do n't think this is so surprising a visit .	projections were far too optimistic .
admittedly ...	our e.p.s . was one fifty last quarter . we 're up eight cents per share .
but , the expectation was ten . and , in this case , expectation is everything .	will you really hold me to it over < u > pennies < /u > ?
my stock 's falling . is n't yours ? those pennies are costing me millions .	the stock will turn .
it probably will . in fact , i 'd go so far as to say it almost certainly will , in time . why should i settle for that ?	because it 's fair . give me next quarter . if you still feel this way , vote your shares ...
you 're talking tomorrow . today is what counts .	you intractable son-of-a-bitch . if your father could see you now ...
what ?	your father was a friend . goddamn it ... i watched you grow up . how do you end up treating me like this ?
it is so very inappropriate for you to mention my father . or , did you think this , between us , was friendship ? just because you went fishing with my father , i should sit on my hands while you throw my money away ?	now , look ...
i 'll be done in a minute . you misspoke before . you 're not `` stepping down . '' i 'm taking you out at the knees . the whole point is to prove that you 're not deciding anything anymore . i 'm firing you . action 's taken . confidence restored . stock goes up . i sell my shares .	there is no baer/grant publishing without alan baer .
i could fight you on this .	you could . but , if i leave without your signature , this agreement begins to disintegrate ; benefits shrink , options narrow , compensations shrivel .
are you finished ?	no . this is my lawyer , samuel sutherland . i thought you two should meet .
i only mention it because i took the test this afternoon , down on montgomery street .	did you ? kudos .
did you play recently ?	hm ? no , about a year ago . i was working out of los angeles .
i 've heard good things about their london branch . you have to admit , it sounds like some fantasy , role-playing nonsense .	you want to know what it is ? what it 's all about ? john . chapter nine . verse twenty-five .
i , uh ... have n't been to sunday school in years ...	`` whereas once i was blind , now i can see . '' night , nick . best of luck .
christine ! mister van orton is a valued customer ...	then , you kiss his ass .
you do n't talk to me like that .	i apologized , i offered to help .
clean out your locker .	fine , dennis . soon as i get my money for this week .
i 'm so sorry .	please , do n't do that ...
i apologize , sir , i 'm having a bad day ...	a bad month . you did the exact same thing to me last week .
do n't help me , just get more napkins . and soda water .	it was an accident .
terrific . i now have a hundred dollar dry cleaning bill .	i said i was sorry ...
pardon me ... miss ... ?	oh , no ... you .
i 'm not sure how this works . do you have something for me ... ? i got this note ...	what are you babbling about , psycho ?
i want to know what 's going on . are you part of this ?	what 's going on ? i 'm going on my second job this month , and now i 'm going on unemployment .
excuse me , i need to explain ...	do n't explain . fuck off . goodbye .
what 's with him ?	i do n't know ... he fell .
do you know what to do ?	i do n't think he 's breathing .
oh , god ... !	do n't just stand there , get help !
this ca n't be real ...	he 's pissing his pants . is that real enough for you ? call 911 !
alright ... okay ...	he 's turning blue !
this is nuts .	what < u > is < /u > your problem ?
let 's talk to whoever can get this over with ...	hold on ... they want your driver 's license number .
you 've got to be kidding .	what ... is ... happening ... ?
i was trying to tell you ... it 's a game .	a game ?
it 's run by a company ... they play elaborate pranks . things like this . i 'm really only now finding out myself .	what are you talking about ?
the lights went out , one hundred people all ran away ...	you mean , the guy who turned blue and < u > wet < /u > himself ... ?
i 'm sorry , about this ...	you should be .
there 's got to be a flashlight .	i do n't understand why they 're getting you involved .
see you around .	where are you going ?
home .	how do you know that 's the way ?
where 'd you all go ? motherfucking frat boys . you better hide . is your life so pathetic that this is something you 're willing to pay for ?	it was a gift ... from my brother .
long story . i found this key in the mouth of a wooden harlequin .	never mind .
do n't even think about it .	why not ?
read what it says : `` warning , do < u > not < /u > attempt to open . if elevator stops , use emergency ... ``	if there was one .
`` ... wait for help . '' wait for help . i 'm not opening a door that specifically warns me not to .	are you suggesting we wait till someone finds us ?
i 'll give you a boost .	you first .
this is n't an attempt to be gallant . if i do n't lift you , how are you going to get there ?	you pull me up .
it 's much easier this way . come on , step up ...	no .
please ...	i 'm not wearing underwear . okay ? there , i said it . satisfied .
there 's a ladder here .	my hero . let 's go .
i 'll wait .	it 's not like anyone could actually open it .
this is c.r.s .	what 's c.r.s . ?
do n't panic . when security gets here , we simply explain what happened ...	they 'll love that .
you deserted me .	you 're a grown man . i 'm not responsible for you .
you 're the one who started running .	me ? you 're the one who ... ! shit !
there goes a thousand dollars .	your < u > shoes < /u > cost a thousand dollars ?
that one did .	... two hundred dollars a toe .
never did catch your name .	nicholas . nicholas van orton .
that 's classic .	why ... ?
we hang down here and drop . the garbage 'll break our fall .	i think not .
where are we going ?	that tall , bright building . near there .
what exactly do you do ?	investment banking . moving money from place to place .
nice .	hm ? oh , yes .
a fresh shirt ...	if this was my office , i would n't keep that closed .
i know the owner of campton place . i could talk to him in the morning .	do n't . it was a shitty job anyway . i overreacted .
goodnight .	i do n't think i 've ever spent this much time with someone who did n't even ask my name .
the maitre d ' called you christine .	right . call me christy .
goodnight , christy . it was nice meeting you .	give me an address so i can send your shirt back .
i have a confession to make . someone gave me six-hundred dollars to spill drinks on you , as a practical joke .	seriously ? what did they say ?
what are you doing here ?	can we talk ?
did n't think i 'd ever see you again .	come here ...
what is it ?	is this you ?
where 'd you get this ?	it was left in my hotel room , well , not really mine . you 're saying it 's not you ?
i think i would remember . what makes you think it 's me ?	well ... the red bra .
okay .	i thought ...
do you mind if i sit ?	sure . you alright ? is this still that contest you 're in ...
i 'm tired . i 'm sorry , i should go . i 've been enough of a nuisance .	let me go get some clothes on . we 'll talk , okay ? be right back .
want anything to drink ?	you ?
take the picture out .	what 's wrong ?
take the picture out of the frame and show it to me .	i do n't ...
they 're watching .	wha ... ?
no ! i 'm sick of this ...	nicholas ...
what is this ! ?	god , wake up , it 's a con !
what are you doing ... ?	get out .
i could 've handed you to them . they find me now , i 'm dead ...	get out of my car !
you can talk while i drive us to the police .	no cops . i 've got a warrant out . mail fraud . they 'll take me in , but you wo n't be able to prove anything else .
who are `` they ? ''	i do n't know , nobody does . i 'm an employee .
then , what good are you ?	i know things ... like who you can trust . like that your brother was in on it from the beginning .
that 's a lie ...	yeah ? i was your waitress on your birthday . connie told you about c.r.s . that day , remember ? i was already playing my part , < u > before < /u > you started the game .
it was n't his fault . he thought it was his only way back . they fleeced him real good .	how ? how could they have gotten anything ?
they did the same to him as they did to you .	what are you talking about ... ?
why else would they be willing to put you under ... ?	overseas operator ? please dial allgemeine bank , zurich .
what did you say ?	i did n't say anything .
my name 's not christine . it 's not my real ...	who the fuck cares ?
it 's just money . you should be glad you 're alive .	it might be best if we did n't talk .
all i mean is ... someone like you ...	how many times have you done this ? i 'm interested .
what ?	scams , con games . how many ?
i do n't know . a lot .	whatever kind of nickel-and-dime shit you did before , this is more than just me . your friends raided pension plans , and payrolls ... they took just over six-hundred million . you ruined people 's lives .
who is it ?	what do we do ?
who is it ?	what do you mean ? i checked them myself . i made the calls ...
mm ... i would n't worry about it .	what ... what do you mean ?
what are you < u > doing < /u > here ?	i 'm back from the dead .
get us out of here ...	nicholas ...
what do you think you 're doing ?	you tell me ... i want to know who 's behind this . who did this to me ... how , why ... ?
how deluded can you be ? there 's no < u > why < /u > ...	who 's responsible ? !
it was n't you . it was n't personal ...	you call them ...
it could have been any asshole with a couple hundred million in the bank .	call them , tell them to get the boss up here . tell them i 'll kill you ...
they wo n't ...	they will ! you tell them if they do n't come now , i will shoot you !
where 'd you get that ... ?	... what ... ?
what the fuck are you ... ?	where 'd you get that gun ?
it 's mine ...	we searched the house .
guess you missed it .	just ... wait . just wait ! okay ... please , i 'm not kidding anymore ...
he 's got a gun . everyone , he 's got a < u > real < /u > gun up here ! real situation ! ... damn it ...	what are you doing ?
nicholas , this is fake . it 's all part of the game ...	fuck you .
listen very carefully , i 'm telling the truth ... this is the game . this was all the game .	bullshit . they killed him . feingold , fisher , whoever ... they shot him ...
no , now wait ... think about it . what did you see ... ?	i saw them kill him !
what did you < u > really see < /u > ? this whole time ... special effects , squibs , like in the movies . please , you 've got to believe me ... he 's got a gun , with real bullets !	stop talking to them !
okay ... okay ... i put it down . now open that door . mister fisher 's right on the other side of that door . he 's an actor ...	stop talking ...
nicholas ...	shut up !
no ! you take another step , i 'll shoot ! they 're trying to kill me ...	you 're wrong . you 're about to make the biggest mistake of your life . put that gun down .
think about it ! they followed you every step of the way . there was always a safety net . the taxi , there was a diver . at my house , the window was rigged ... they shot at us with blanks ...	that 's not true ...
it is . it 's what you hired us for . nobody touched your money . nobody stole anything . they 're waiting on the other side of that door with champagne ... all your friends ... it 's a celebration ...	no ...
open that door , you 'll see . your brother 's there ... conrad . he 's there . it 's your birthday party ...	stop it !
do n't move , you bitch ... !	i have to show you ...
hi . did n't get a chance to say goodbye .	that 's my fault . i get too worked up at these . i 'm very method . you do know ... that 's not my name .
i did n't know what else to call you .	claire .
i have to get to the airport ...	where are you going in such a hurry ?
there 's another gig starting in saudi arabia . i 'm just a walk-on this time though . bit-part .	what about dinner sometime , when you get back ? would that be ... ?
is this something you 're interested in ? i 'm not really that person i was .	i realize . maybe you could ... tell me a little about yourself .
like what ... my favorite color ... ?	like ... where are you from ?
originally , connecticut .	big family ... small ?
one brother , one sister .	studied acting , i assume ?
julliard , yeah .	single ?
yes .	boyfriend ?
no .	underwear ?
hey there , nickie .	conrad , what a surprise . gesundheit .
happy birthday , man .	`` seymour butts . '' i never get tired of that one .
they gave me a free jacket at the door .	they 'll be wanting it back .
not after i 'm done with it . actually , i 've been here . in grad-school i bought crystal-meth from the maitre d ' .	which grad-school ?
you look good .	so do you . and to think i was worried ...
about me ?	how long 's it been ? since mom died ... four years ? how are you ?
never better .	elizabeth ?
divorced . remarried to some pediatrician or gynecologist , or pediatric gynaecologist , in sausalito .	too bad , i liked her . so , you 're all alone in the house of pain ?
i redecorated . what about you ?	nowhere in particular . do n't you keep track of my whereabouts anymore ?
connie ... what brings you here ? is everything alright ?	yeah .
you need anything ?	no .
really ?	i do n't need anything from you . i was laying on a beach somewhere in spain , naked , and , it hit me -- nickie 's birthday . so , here i am , four layovers , twenty-seven hours flying and one donkey ride later . not necessarily in that order .
for you .	you should n't have .
call that number .	`` consumer recrreation services . '' what , do they make golf clubs ?
trust me . call that number .	why ?
they make your life fun . their only guarantee is you will not be bored .	fun ?
you 've heard of it . you 've seen other people having it . they 're an entertainment service , but more than that .	this is n't an escort service ?
it 's a profound life experience .	like a stroke ?
tell me you 'll call .	okay .
will you ?	i said i would ...
but , will you ?	are you still on mediction ?
i thought you 'd like this . best thing i ever did . if you do n't want to do it , do n't ...	i 'll call them , okay ?
it does n't matter ...	i 'm going to call .
do it for you .	okay , okay ... okay ? i just ... you know i hate surprises .
tell me where we 're going .	just drive , man . it 's fucking nuts !
what 's this all about , connie ?	shhhhhhh . wait ... wait ...
what are you doing ?	they 're methodical . they 're nothing if they 're not that .
who ?	c.r.s . who do you think ? jesus h. , thank your lucky charms . to think what i almost got you into .
yeah , almost ...	you dodged a bullet .
how do you mean , exactly ?	they fuck you and they fuck you and they fuck you . and then , just when you think it 's done , that 's when the < u > real < /u > fucking begins .
slow down , take a breath ...	it does n't stop , nick . i paid the bill , i gave 'em their money , but it all started again . they wo n't leave me alone ...
what have they been doing to you ?	everything . i 'm a goddamn human-pinata ...
calm down . why would they keep playing after you paid ?	you think i know ? i paid them < u > more < /u > to make it stop .
it 's them . they did this .	it 's a flat tire . that 's all .
how do you know ?	we 're going to figure this out . get a grip on yourself .
the phone 's dead .	really ?
do you know how to change a tire ?	no . do you ? ca n't be too hard , can it ? i do n't think we should be here out in the open like this .
how did those ... ?	you 're part of it ...
no ! you 're one of them . of course , it makes perfect sense !	no , it does n't ! those keys were put there . i did n't even know ...
you 're behind this , are n't you ? you and your sick friends . well , make it stop !	listen to yourself . why would i do anything like what you 're describing ?
because you hate me . because you had to be here , when mom died . because you had to do it alone . well , do n't you think if i 'd known ... i'd 've been here too . i 'd have been here ...	stop this . it 's not true ...
i 'm sorry , christ , i 'm sorry ! how many more times do i have to say i 'm sorry before you forgive me ... ?	stop it !
you know ... how 'd you manage the gun ? i mean ...	baby , they were all over the house with metal detectors . they switched your gun with a look-alike , rigged barrel , loaded with blanks . pop-gun .
what ?	this ... ? oh , this is just ... this is the bill .
really ?	yeah .
split it ?	oh , god yes please . thanks , man . i 'll take you up on that .
where 's christine ? the waitress .	yeah , yeah . she called a cab . said something about catching a plane .
no money , no identification or passport . you are in a fix . what did happen to you ?	well , where to begin . it 's complicated ...
what happened was , i 'm on vacation , alone ... i was robbed , at gunpoint . they hit me and ran . two men , a few blocks away . they took my wallet , money ... all of it . so ...	robbed ?
yes .	have you gone to the police ?
we 'll help with the police , if you want to bother . as far as money goes ... can i make a suggestion ? you say you were mugged ?	yes .
how much is it ? a few thousand , at least . a rolex like that ... lucky for you they missed it .	yes , very lucky .
i need your car , elizabeth .	what happened to you , nick ? i mean , look at yourself ...
i know , look at me , well ... what happened ? i do n't know . i do n't even really know . i have some things to try to take care of ... i need the car a little while .	of course you can have it if you need it . can i get you something to eat ?
the last few days , um ... i 've been thinking ... had a lot of spare time . i want to tell you ... i 'm starting to understand why you left me . i 've been resenting you for it , maybe , but ... i want to apologize , for all of it . for shutting you out , for not being there . i ... anyway , i hope you can forgive me .	there 's nothing to forgive .
it would mean a lot to me ... if you and i could be friends . if i could have you back in my life ... in some small way . it would be important .	of course , nick ...
it 's just a t.v . he 's just an actor .	yes .
i 'll explain someday .	i hope .
we have to head out ... just wanted to say goodbye .	you 're going ? well , thanks again . good to see you , rachel ... thanks for coming , mel . i 'll get your car back . right now it 's , uh ... at the zoo . sorry .
happy birthday , nicholas .	i 'll call . i really will .
jim feingold , v.p. , e.d.a . engineering and data analysis .	i 'm not quite sure how this works . my brother ...
v-a-n ... o-r-t-o-n ... a gift from conrad van orton . interesting ...	what is ?
your brother was a client with our london branch . we do a sort of informal scoring . his numbers were outstanding . sure you 're not hungry at all ... ? tung hoy , best in chinatown ...	no , thank you .
i do n't write the questions . i just review them .	what 's all this for ?
we want a sense of your overall capabilities , limitations , turn-ons , turn-offs ...	no , i mean , what is it for ? what are you selling ?
oh ... it 's a game .	a game ?
tailored specifically to each participant . think of it as a great vacation , except you do n't go to it , it comes to you .	what kind of vacation ?
it 's different every time .	humor me with specifics .
we provide whatever 's lacking .	and if nothing 's lacking ?
may i make two suggestions ... ?	do you really expect me to participate without knowing a single thing ?
how long will these take ?	an hour for those ... maybe another for the physical .
physical ?	cursory examination . turn-your-head- and-cough sort of thing . you 'll be out of here in no time .
sorry to keep you waiting .	do n't worry . it 's been terrific spending the entire day with your `` crack team '' .
one guarantee . payment 's entirely at your brother 's discretion and , as a gift , dependent on your satisfaction .	you mean , i do n't like it , he does n't pay ?
it 's never happened . we 've never had an unsatisfied customer .	you mean , < u > dis < /u > satisfied .
get rid of them .	hey , everyone -- snack time ! here ... here you go ...
look , it was just a job . nothing personal , ya know ? i play my part , improvise a little . that 's what i 'm good at .	i 'm tired of dealing with peons . i need to get to whoever 's in charge .
goddamnit , why do they do that ?	how do i find them ? their offices are empty .
they know you ... you worked for them . you can get me in .	no , i ca n't . i 'm sorry and all , but ...
tell them the cops are after you ... tell them you 've got to talk to someone , i 'm threatening to blow the whistle .	what whistle ? there 's no fucking whistle . this is fucking dangerous .
drive in .	what are you gon na do anyway ? you wo n't get your money back .
you do n't need me ...	shut up . cuff him to the rail .
where ?	i told you , they hired me over the phone . i never met anyone .
where 'd you pick up your checks ?	it was a different floor then ...
guess !	like , this way ... sort of ...
i need the police .	let 's get you dried off first . i might have some clothes below .
you know , these fit ... perfectly .	they were my husband 's . my late husband ... may he rest in peace .
i 've been so lonely .	i ca n't tell you how < u > not < /u > interested i am .
do n't be nervous . they said you 'd be nervous .	do n't take another step .
is n't this what you like ? they told me you had a thing for boats .	first they try to kill me , now you ? put your damn clothes back on .
ah , mr. van orton . here you go ...	have we met ?
show mr. van orton to his room .	the key ?
hm ?	is there a room key ?
did n't i give you two ?	no , you did n't ...
thank you .	have a nice day .
dinner 's in the oven .	thank you . goodnight .
you did ? how is he ?	okay . i think he 's into some sort of new personal improvement cult .
is everything alright ?	fine .
i 've finished for the evening . will you be needing anything else ?	no , thank you . goodnight .
mr. van orton ... ?	ilsa ... you 're alright ?
yes . what do you mean ? what 's wrong ?	did the alarm go off ? the house ... they ... you did n't see ... ?
i do n't know what you 're talking about . what 's happened ?	there 's been a break in . lock this door and stay here . do n't move a muscle .
what makes you ask ?	i 'm not sure .
all the time i 've known you , you 've never once asked about him .	he came to my mind recently , that 's all .
your mother thought he was a good man . he worked very hard . what i remember most was his manner was so ... slight . it was easy to spend time in a room , and not realize he 'd been there the whole time .	was he morose , or ... ? i mean ...
no . what happened ... no one expected it .	sometimes i wonder how much of him there is in me .
not much , i think .	i 'm just like him .
you 're not like him at all . i do n't know exactly what 's going on around here lately , but do n't make me start worrying about you .	did you worry about him ?
goodnight . see you home .	goodnight . where was she ?
what 's the trouble ?	you 're here for conrad van orton ? i 'm the hotel manager ...
pleasure to meet you , i 'd like to see my brother , thank you .	your brother . will you come with me ?
what 's this about ?	it 's a private matter , for you ... i think you 'll be more comfortable ...
there were complaints by other guests , and damage to his room . we did the best we could to accommodate his behavior .	his behavior ... ?
he could n't , or refused to pay . we extended credit ...	look , where is he ? !
invitations : the museum gala .	no .
the fitzwilliam botanical garden annual fundraiser .	no .
the hinchberger wedding .	let me think ... hordes of men in tuxedos . everyone 's droning . ludwell 's trying to break the ice by reciting an off-color limerick ...
i 'll send your regrets . honestly , why must i even bother ?	because , if you do n't know about society , you do n't have the satisfaction of avoiding it .
your ex-wife .	i know who she is . take a message .
i do n't like her .	i would n't mention the following , except he was very insistent . it 's obviously some sort of prank ...
what ?	a gentleman left a message requesting a lunch , but i assured him ...
what gentleman , maria ?	a mister ... seymour butts .
`` under the bleachers '' ... by seymour butts .	pardon me ? i 'm afraid i do n't ...
what the fuck ... ? !	why are you following me ?
look ... what i 'm doing is none of your business ...	is alan baer `` the game ? '' is that what this is ?
hey ... !	nice touch . does the game use real bullets ... ?
anything wrong ... ?	nothing . nothing at all .
i was n't expecting you .	wanted to wish you luck . not that you 'll need it .
attractive ...	do n't ask .
what 's happened ...	follow me .
nicholas ...	that you 've involved conrad ... is unforgivable . i am now your enemy .
how concerned should i be ?	it was a misunderstanding .
someone 's playing hardball . it 's complicated . can i ask a favor ?	you know you can .
find out about a company called c.r.s . consumer recreation services .	sounds like they make tennis rackets . what do we know ?
just what i told you .	nothing else ?
christ ... i ca n't believe it ... invisible ink ?	you 're joking .
very well . if you tell me not to worry , i sha n't .	sam ... thank you .
he has n't called back .	what about the house ?
illegal surveillance , reckless endangerment ...	attempted murder .
bravo , young man . you have to tell me what this was all about sometime . i want you to know ... when it looked there for awhile like you were going slowly insane ... i was fully prepared to have you committed to the < u > finest < /u > mental-health facility available . i mean that sincerely , do n't thank me .	you warm my heart .
hi . i 'm todd aubochon .	greetings fellow insomniac .
these old victorian houses are great , are n't they ?	it 's not victorian , everyone thinks that the whole nineteenth century was victorian . this is gothic , this is english craftsman , this is romanesque . this is ... insane . who lives here ?
you know what i love about wine that comes in bottles like this ?	what ?
hi , luke sanderson , bad sleeper , i 'm your basic tosser-turner , and you are ...	uh ... nell vance ...
and what kind of sleeper ?	well , i ... uh ...
i only saw theo drive up .	who 's watts ?
the children . the children hugh crain built the house for . the children he never had .	come on . these are the typically sentimental gestures of a depraved industrialist .
could n't get the last ones . you ?	i did okay .
welcome home eleanor . welcome home ? i 've never been here . who did this ?	it 's somebody 's idea of a joke .
modelling small-group dynamics in the formation of narrative hallucinations . you brought us here to scare us . insomnia , that was just a decoy issue . you 're disgusting .	is this true ? i 've been hypnotized ?
and this is my assistant , mary lambretta .	greetings .
so why did you need the addam 's family mansion for a scientific test ?	i thought it best to be isolated , to be in a location with a definite sense of history , and i wanted to make sure that it was n't so pleasant you 'd all sleep too easily . you 'll be taking a variety of tests , none of them harmful , and you 've got the house , the grounds , and each other to keep you company .
that could have been worse .	yeah .
luke , can i talk to you ?	sure .
because ... well , i know i can trust you .	why ?
do you need me anymore ? cause i 'm going to bed . they can stay up talking another 45 minutes if they want , but i got ta try to get some sleep .	go ahead .
and those are luke 's and mine .	there 's a carriage house around back .
i gave my key to the gate to todd , but the dudleys 'll be here in the morning .	do we still get paid for the week ?
is that the question of compassion or science ?	it 's a question .
it 's not going to hold your weight .	just stay there , nell !
you 're not telling us something .	watts . those were his keys nell found . his roommate called and said watts left when he was supposed to . i think he 's here .
the rest of you may hate your insomnia , but i find it the best time of the day for me . i 'm alone . nobody 's talking to me but myself . my mind is racing with ideas , and i can think .	nah , you 're going crazy with doubt , all of your mistakes are coming back up the pipes , and it 's worse than a nightmare . --
he said that hugh crain ... hugh crain was a monster . he said that he was a brutal , horrible man . he told me that crain drove his workers to early deaths . crain had children chained to the looms in his mill . and listen to this : his beautiful rene killed herself .	and why did n't marrow tell < u > us < /u > ? does n't he trust women ? that fuck .
hey ! i heard screaming ...	luke .
well , this lot is full !	he must have left . did n't like the looks of the place or something .
i did n't do it .	you could have .
so could you ! is this some fucked up idea of art , putting someone else 's name to a painting ?	no .
mister very talky , would you please say what it is about this study that bothers you ?	the whole thing feels like experimental misdirection . like he says it 's about one thing , a psychological profile of environmental effects on insomnia ... and that 'd be a legitimate study , but i think that we 've been subjected to an academic bait and switch ; he 's really looking at something else .
we 're fucked . we 're in a haunted house and we ca n't get out until the morning .	you do n't really believe it 's haunted ... do you believe in ghosts ?
that depends on your definition of ghosts . i 'm going to check on her , and then i 'm going to stay awake .	all night ?
yeah .	you want company ?
you used the wrong test .	will the two of you shut up ! god damn it ! maybe the tests were right , marrow . she 's sensitive , she 's vulnerable , but i do n't think she 's suicidal and i did n't have to test her . maybe she was n't trying to kill herself . maybe she was really scared . maybe she really heard voices .
nell --	-- how much is this car worth ?
was sure she 'd be in here .	where in the hell can she be .
nell !	we ca n't stay here looking for her . she does n't want to be found ...
it 's still an electric shock !	come on malcolm , it 's only seven ohms , it 's nothing , it 's like a joy buzzer ! and it 's not about the pain , it 's about the interference with concentration ...
malcolm , this is essential work i 'm doing . just think what my research can do for education . elementary school classrooms near train tracks or airports , where loud noise is random ; this helps to prove the need for sound insulation if the children are ever going to learn to read .	and that will be a good place to end this study .
no , malcolm ! individual performance is only part of it . i know why baseball players choke for no reason , i know why violinists throw up with fear before every concert , and need to , to give a great performance , but what i want to know is , how fear works in a group ...	not the way you 've constructed your group , it 's just not ethical !
are you working with her ?	mary , i 'll meet you outside .
why are you working with her ? mary lambretta was thrown out of the department for trying to get a ph.d. in psychic studies .	and after she was thrown out , she needed a job .
you do n't believe in the paranormal .	no , but she does , and that 's all that matters .
does she know that 's why you 're using her ?	no .
i , i just ca n't ...	she needed a job , malcolm . and she 's smart . and she helps me .
i have a bad feeling about what you 're doing .	this is the last chapter . please , please give me clearance . it 's for science .
eleanor , how was the drive ?	you can call me nell , dr. marrow .
nell . good enough . and i 'm jim .	i 'm really ... honored to be part of this study , jim .
you wrote that you had trouble sleeping .	yes , because someone was always keeping me awake . ever since i was little . that was my job . i took care of my mother and i had to be there for her all night long , and she woke up all the time . and after she died , well , it 's been a few months , but i still , i still wake up , it 's ... a habit . i know we 've only known each other a couple of hours , but i 'm really glad to be with people who let me talk about this . i 'm really happy to be here with you .
all the carvings .	but there 's a sad catch to the story .
the cold sensation . who felt it first ?	theo i think . you 've asked us that three times , doctor marrow . what 's going on ?
sorry .	for an american you do a good imitation of the british at their most apologetic . pardon me . excuse me , sorry , sorry ...
nell ! what 's wrong ?	that smell ... oh , god .
what did it smell like ?	it was very specific .
all right ...	in the bathroom in my mother 's room , the toilet was next to an old wooden table . it smelled like that wood .
so ... smell ... is ... smell is the sense that triggers the most powerful memories . and a memory can trigger a smell .	i was n't thinking about my mother 's bathroom .
what happened after you smelled it ?	i looked at theo . she had a look on her face .
like she smelled it too ?	yes .
and then what happened ?	i got more scared .
hmm .	i 'm sorry . i 'm messing up the study .
are you coming to confess ?	i wish i were . i wish i had done it , then i could confess and you 'd be at peace . that great moral philosopher frank sinatra once said to someone he loved , i wish you had an enemy , so i could beat him up .
let 's say it was n't you . who did it ?	i do n't know .
it was a stupid thing to do .	it was .
welcome home .	you 'll never see it again . mr. dudley 's taking care of it . i 'm sorry , nell . can i show you something you 'd like to see ?
someone is playing with you .	why ?
i do n't know .	it does n't matter . even if they 're tormenting me , someone wants me . what i do with this is up to me . i can be a victim , or i can be a volunteer . and i want to be the volunteer .
what is that tune ?	i do n't know . a lullaby i guess . my mother used to hum it to me . and her mother before that , and so on . hugh crain , would you care to dance ?
nell ... please , nell ... take a deep breath ...	and they 're all locked together in here ... and he wo n't let go of them !
i had n't done a study of how group fear affects individual performance . mass hysteria is like a story , nell . a communal story . someone starts it . then we all add a little more to it . and then for some reason -- no one knows how -- we start believing it . this story shapes what we see and hear . we interpret everything through it , make it fit the story . i started our story when i gave you the history of hill house . you 've added to it . that 's what this experiment has all been about . that 's what it was about , the experiment 's over . i 'm pulling the plug . this is my fault .	it 's not real ? crain ? he 's not real ?
why would we want to do that , nell ?	because that 's where he burned them up , the child laborers from his mills ! because that 's where their bones are ! he killed < i > hundreds < /i > . he took them here and he killed them . their bones are in the fireplace !
the children want me . they 're calling me . they need me .	nell . you will come here now .
but you told me to look in the paper ! you told me i 'd be perfect !	nell , the first time i ever spoke with you in person was the night we met here .
no .	my mother used to hum this to me . like her mother hummed it to her . and my great grandmother carolyn hummed it to her .
come on .	no --
what 'll happen to us , nell ?	nothing , if you leave right now . there 's a war going on all around us . do n't get in the way , please .
you know what he 's really upset about ?	what ?
you hear the vibrations in the wire . there 's a magnetic pulse in the wires , you feel it . i could test it .	test it .
yes , this is doctor marrow .	how 'd i know it was for you ?
here 's how they 're organized . groups of five , very different personalities : scored all over the kiersey temperament sorter just like you asked for . and they all score high on the insomnia charts .	good .
what 's this ? what 's this ... this picture ?	that ? that 's hill house .
this is where we 're going ?	yes . it 's perfect , is n't it ?
what happened ?	there were no children . rene died , and < u > then < /u > hugh crain built all of this , and then he died . his heart was broken .
have either of you seen david watts ?	no , but nell 's been here longer than i have .
when do we take the tests ?	every day . basically we 'll be hanging out together like we have so far this evening .
well this is a cozy breakfast .	good morning , theo . luke .
maybe they 're mary 's .	mary came with me .
get a blanket !	it 's okay ... we 're all here ...
your fear of him was real . that 's all the ghost anyone needs .	how could you do this to people ?
is she asleep ?	yes . but i promised i would n't let her alone the whole night .
she needs help .	i 'll take her with me to the university tomorrow . i ca n't believe i read the test wrong . i did n't see anything that looked like she was suicidal .
he 's wandering around the house , and nell heard him . she thought it was ghosts . let 's go look for him again .	no . if he 's lost somewhere in the house ... he 'll have to stay lost until tomorrow , until the night is over . what we have to do now is be together , with nell .
oh god , we ca n't get out !	nell , what do we do ?
i 'm not going back to new york city . i 'm going to find an apartment with a little flower garden , where you can just see the ocean and at night , when the wind comes in just right , you can hear the sound of the harbor . what about you ?	i 'm a scientist . i just conducted an experiment . now i have to write it up .
what do you want ?	oh ! you scared me .
me ? no . what are you doing here ?	are you mister dudley , the caretaker ?
yeah , i 'm mister dudley , the caretaker . what are you doing here ?	i 'm with dr. marrow 's group . i 'm supposed to check in with mrs. dudley up at the house . is she here ?
why do you need a chain like that ?	that 's a good question . what is it about fences ? sometimes a locked chain makes people on both sides of the fence just a little more comfortable . why would that be ?
is there something about the house ?	mrs. dudley 'll be waiting for you .
that 's where she hanged herself .	who ?
why ?	why 'd she kill herself ?
yes .	she was unhappy .
why ?	ca n't say . have n't been here that long . well , it 's labor day , got ta get to work .
it 's make the soup or answer the door . ca n't do both .	mrs. dudley .
they 're so beautiful . are n't they ?	i 've seen 'em . lot to dust .
it 's a job . i keep banker 's hours . i set dinner on the dining room sideboard at six . you can serve yourselves . breakfast is ready at nine . i do n't wait on people . i do n't stay after dinner . not after it begins to get dark . i leave before dark comes . we live in town . nine miles . so there wo n't be anyone around if you need help . we could n't even hear you , in the night .	why would we --
no one could . no one lives any nearer than town .	no one will come any nearer than that .
and what you 're wearing , that 's great , too .	this ? it 's from a thrift shop .
what did it cost ?	fifteen dollars .
that 'd be seventy in new york . you stole it !	it 's all i could afford .
wait . you 're not wearing that ironically ? this is really you ?	i do n't know what you mean .
do n't worry , i probably wo n't be in here much . light sleeper .	that 's why we 're here .
what do you do ?	i 'm between jobs right now . my last job ... it ... the person i was working for ... the job ended . over . so ... and you ?
not really .	do n't tell me boston is different from new york .
ohh , sure , you have trouble with commitment .	my boyfriend thinks so , my girlfriend does n't . if we could all live together ... but ... they hate each other . it 's hard to be miss perversity when you 're the only one at the party . d'you know what i mean ?
no .	a blank canvas ! i could paint your portrait , directly on you . or maybe not . so , you ? husbands ? boyfriends ? girlfriends ? where do you live ?
jeez .	i know .
i love this house . i really love this house .	you 're okay .
a monster ? but he built this for the woman he loved , like the taj mahal .	the taj mahal was n't a palace , it was a tomb . why did n't he tell us ?
you 've been out of the world for a long time , have n't you ?	yes . i 've missed it .
good night , theo .	you , too . happy tossing and turning .
if this was some sort of joke , i 'm going to kill him .	you know it was n't a joke , theo .
yes . i feel realy rested , too . theo ?	i guess . oh , your hair ! it looks good .
how could he have left without his keys ?	two sets . i do n't know . maybe they 're not even his .
watts ?	what 's his first name ?
david .	david ? david watts ? can you hear us ? david ! daviiiiid !
david ?	maybe he never came in . if he 'd come in , he would have left his bags at the door , right ? or maybe he got here early , and went for a walk , and fell . maybe he 's outside .
is it over ?	no , it 's getting worse .
theo ... did you ?	maybe you did it yourself .
why ?	i do n't know . you 've been alone for a long time , maybe you want attention . maybe he did it ...
that 's so sad .	there 's hundreds of them . this must be a record of the children who died at the mills , like luke said .
well , it was n't me . mister dudley had to clean it and he knows that he 's in charge of all the messes so why would he make more work for himself and ... you said the good doctor was with you .	i do n't know what to think anymore .
i 've never had a pedicure before .	well ?
i 'm sorry i was mad at you , theo .	me too . although i learned one thing about you , that you do n't know about yourself . you can be a pretty decent bitch .
i 'll take that as a compliment . in the city , what kind of place do you live in ?	i have a loft .
you want to move to new york , you want to move in with me ?	i do n't know , you know ...
my place is n't like yours , nell , it does n't have a view of sea . it does n't have a view of anything . what 's interesting about the way i live is what goes on inside the walls . living with me ... my boundaries are n't very well defined , nell . do you know what i mean ?	i 'm trying . have you ever kept something to yourself because you were afraid it 'd ruin things .
are you sure ?	i think so .
marrow said the same thing as last night , he < u > says < /u > -- -- that he checked with mrs. dudley . and he says that she told him that all the fireplaces in the west wing connect to the main chimney . he says that he thinks that the flue was open , and with the windstorm , he says that what probably happened was some kind of freak air current --	-- what do you think ?
then who is ? come on , nell . deep down , if you really thought it was n't jim , why would n't you be leaving right this second ? why would n't you be afraid ? really afraid .	because i do n't want to ruin things . because home is where the heart is .
nell , what happened ?	carolyn showed me where she hid him , hid him with all the ones he killed --
this is real , i 'm not making it up ! theo , you saw it ! you were there -- the banging and last night . you , you all saw the painting !	nell , it makes sense . it all makes sense . you and i , we were scaring each other , working each other up .
i 'm going to stay with you until you fall asleep . and then i 'm going to get some brandy .	i do n't think i want any .
they 're all in here . all the ones he killed . they 're just children ! we have to help them !	come on ! why are we waiting ?
what 'd you come back for , babe ?	just had to be sure .
oh , theo . you know i do n't have an apartment .	then let 's go get you one .
adhara . i told your father , if you 're looking for a name , you ca n't go wrong with a constellation .	i used to hate it . now i like it .
is there anything in the world that you want or need ?	i < u > want < /u > to know why you < u > need < /u > that scary guy in your house .
gordon ? he 's been with me for years . he 's not as tough as he looks .	then what good is he ?
is it possible that you 're too young to be acquainted with the idea of loyalty ?	is that a problem ?
not for you , clearly .	i 'm loyal to things that make me happy .
am i a thing ?	well , you 're certainly not a person .
i 'm not .	no . you 're not specific enough to be a person . you 're more like a vibe .
i 'm so glad we 're having this chat .	it 's not a knock .
it 's not a compliment .	it 's an observation . like : i 'm hungry . when are we eating ?
as soon as you get dressed .	what kind of food ?
anything but japanese .	why ?
i 'm not into finger foods . too fussy .	like you .
i do n't like do-it-yourself cuisine . buffets . salad bars .	you demand to be served . a fork fetishist .
it 's just fuel to me . i 'm not there for distractions .	for some , eating is a sensual experience . < u > the < /u > sensual experience .
that 's what gordon 's always saying .	oh , god .
italian ?	i 'm sorry .
italian .	who ?
not who , food . should we get italian .	sure .
i like the colors .	we all did .
hey , i thought you were n't a buffet person .	i 'm a gracious host .
i 've lived in l.a. all my life , i 've never done this drive .	all your life . that happened while i swam the length of my pool .
what 's the matter ?	nothing . i guess it 's hard to pass on this road .
the freeway 's faster , but lacks a certain majesty .	just feels like the car behind has been following us the longest time .
we think someone is here .	we think ?
no .	why not ?
hey .	come over here .
how they goin ' , kid ?	not bad .
how 'd you like to kill someone for me ?	okay .
same as last time -- the rest after .	where do we go ?
when you find the guy , you 'll know .	what shit is this . i just do it . i do n't prepare it .
i 'll point you in the right direction , but you 'll have to take it to the end- zone . he 's a hit-and-run gunman -- i figure he 's not cruising the polo lounge .	this is un-fucking professional .
see , a successful man like me has limitations -- i lose touch at a street level . so i have to depend on a smart boy like you who 's closer to the nitty and the gritty than i am .	fuck you , mr. whatever-your-name is . this is a lifestyle i embrace .
what .	there 's been some trouble downtown .
what kind ?	what the papers used to call a `` gangland slaying . ''
our black friends ?	no , terry . they do n't work like that . jenny wilson 's father paid a little visit , left a message .
i thought he was in prison , in england .	well , either they have a very liberal work-release program , or he 's out , because he 's here in l.a. , looking for you .
you should have let me do the talking .	why , because you 're my security consultant ? this cocksucker nearly burnt my house down .
i mean , gordon must weigh a good four hundred pounds .	heavier than that now . but are there any drugs in that stomach to back up your story .
as it happens . i did n't make that part up .	and where is this guest ? do n't they want to interview him .
where do < u > you < /u > think he is , mike .	we 'll find him .
no . i mean . not even your people should be involved . right ? it 's too close now .	you could use a few of my prime shitkickers up here .
you think i 'm staying ?	there 's already gon na be talk about how people close to you keep falling into canyons .
you broke last time .	let him break - he likes to break .
fuck you .	i would n't talk .
huh ?	i saw your mother on the strip last night . she went up to three guys , said she 'd like 'em to stick one in each , know what i mean ?
oh really ? where you from ?	england . only , we saw there was a show on , thought i might pick something up for a price , type of thing .
you came to the right place , sir . my wife 's second cousin is english . well , scotch-irish . can i interest you in a holster ?	just luck , this , really . never been to one of these before .
you 're in gun country now , my friend .	been to the boat show .
i can take care of the paperwork .	yeah ?
man knows what he likes .	lookin ' good .
that 's a high-end item . total reliability .	what 'd you call that -- the protector ?
cq what ?	close quarters combat . keep one in my own home .
edward rama ?	eduardo . rama .
i did n't expect anyone .	no reason .
i mean , what has it been -- six months ?	round about , yeah .
i did n't even know who i was writing to -- just someone with the same last name . she never talked about any family .	it was better than a telegram .
who done it , then ?	huh ?
i never said nothin ' about nothin ' like that . no , no , no . that 's not what i wrote to you .	no , but between the lines , eh ? mysterious circumstances , and that .
this bloke she was bunked up with . this terry what'sit .	terry valentine .
valentine . what 's he got to say for himself ?	i dunno . what 's he gon na say ? they had a fight that night , she drove away , she was upset ? i do n't even know the guy . do n't get me wrong , jenny and me were friends , but we did n't travel in the same social circles . she had her life , i had mine .
what more is there .	i 'm just sayin ' -- it was a steep hillside . there was no moon that night ...
coulda happened to anyone , man . i never knew her to be reckless . i mean , sure , she would smoke a little grass , or something , have a few drinks . but that 's it , nothing more than that .	no , not my girl . self-control , she had . point of pride . and people do n't change , do they .
boomerang .	y'what ?
i knew when i was droppin ' that letter into the mail slot it was gon na come back and smack me in the face . i did my time , okay ? my sister , her ol ' man 's up in chino right now doin ' eight years .	this ai n't your lot ?
i go to work , try to keep my life together , put all that shit behind me , man . what d'you want from me .	i only asked .
what , tryin ' to catch him with another bird ?	that 's what i thought , man . but it was not a hotel or nothin ' that we went to . it was someplace else .
bad place , man . bad people . some guys loading some trucks . some kinda deal goin ' down . i do n't know and i do n't care . maybe they 're shipping fava beans to eskimos .	did jenny know ?
what you gon na do , man ? you gon na go to the cops ?	nah , coppers do n't do nothing , do they .
you should talk to elaine . that was her best friend .	she did n't write to me , did she .
she did n't know what to say . i thought someone should say something . to someone . with me it was , i do n't know -- jenny liked me for some reason . i felt like i owed her .	who 'd jenny get it off of -- this grass or whatever ?
not me , man . i 'm no drug dealer , what you think .	i think you did n't get that lot in the navy , doing your national service .
i already told you , man . corcoran . know what that is ? state prison .	nick 's a nick , n ' it ? no matter what state you 're in . state of remorse , most likely -- for gettin ' caught .
you 're kiddin ' me , right ?	what do i do , then , look in the bleedin ' yellow pages ?
these are not guys you can just go run a number on , man .	thought perhaps there 'd be dispensing machines , you know . bung in your coins , come out with a .44 magnum , fully-loaded .
are you a resident of california ? you gon na fill out forms , man ? do the background check ? go through a three-day waiting period ?	sod that . got ta get back before my probation officer wonders where i 've skived off to .
probation ? man , you crazy . they shouldn't 've let you outta your country , much less prison .	travelling on a dodgy passport , n ' all .
he do n't have a concealed weapons permit .	do n't have time for a lot of paperwork , y'know . just popped over on a quick visit .
no . not at all . do we ?	not me , man .
you hadda show up on a weekend . this weekend . wouldn't 've even been a gun show ... for another month .	fucking out of order , that . should n't be allowed .
now what . you gon na take your new arsenal , go visit terry valentine , just like that ? boom bam boom .	it 's only insurance . ca n't be too careful . this terry valentine , he 's probably a wonderful fella . they were together how long ?
five years , i think . long time .	well , there you are . jen must 've liked him .
jenny told me she met him at the beach . got blinded by his smile . you believe that shit ? son of a bitch never smiled at me . buried her at a `` private '' service . private for who . him ?	hang about . i thought you said he come into the restaurant where you worked with jenny .
he came in with jenny to the restaurant where i work . that 's not where they met .	and that 's where you met jenny .
no , no -- jenny used to work as a waitress . before she met him . but that 's not where she met me . not in my restaurant .	how 'd the two of you hook up , then ?
told you you would n't be able to see through that gate .	gate 's open . i had a butcher 's at the house .
who 'd you butcher at the house ?	butcher 's hook . look . i do n't much reckon those minders of his .
huh ?	he 's brought in the heavy mob .
what ?	extra muscle . bodyguards .
has he ?	they look a right load of wallies . patrolling back and forth outside the gate , all ponced up like the fuckin ' household cavalry . watch it .
that was one of them ?	see what i mean ? wearing bloomin ' uniforms n ' all .
what 's so fucking funny ?	those are n't guards . they 're valets .
valets . what d'ya mean valets . what is he , then , the earl of fucking doncaster ?	< u > valets < /u > . they park cars . he 's having a party .
valets , eh ? are n't we all la-de-da .	i thought you just wanted to check out the house , man .
well , that 's what we 're doin ' , n ' it .	no one else is even here yet .
what are we standing on ?	faith .
bring the motor around . bang out in front , right ?	you goin ' back inside ?
steady on .	you steady on , man . what the fuck else did you do back there .
why did n't you just kill him , you had the chance .	that would be too easy .
too easy ?	he 's got ta know why .
i 've been wondering something .	again ?
do you have any friends , man ?	yeah , i suppose . call 'em that , yeah . down the boozer saturday night . meet some of the lads .
useless gits . i was gon na do the post office once .	what post office ?
what d'you say , elaine ?	not much -- you ?
same .	uh-huh .
last time i saw you , were n't you up for some equity-waiver thing ?	probably .
i was gon na be in that michael mann movie , you know -- with pacino and deniro . got three callbacks .	really .
did n't get it .	well , those are the breaks .
not no more , they ai n't . i quit that acting shit , man .	you just cooking then ?
hey , elaine . you even know what he 's saying half the time ?	no , but i know what he means .
... reminds me of jennifer .	hard to miss .
i thought maybe you just came for the ride .	i 'd rather be with him than without him . i do n't want to be found dead in l.a .
had a feeling it was you .	you look alike .
perhaps it was the smoke .	not her brand .
why did you come here ?	wanted to talk to you , did n't i ?
sort a few things out .	been busy , have you .
how d'you mean ?	it 's been a while .
i was skint -- did n't have no money to get here .	that 's not what i heard .
what was that , then ?	i heard you were -- what 's that adorable phrase ? -- `` at her majesty 's pleasure . ''
in any case , i do n't suppose the salary you make sewing mailbags is really commensurate with international airline travel .	sewing mailbags ? me ? never did an honest day 's work in my life , dear . was n't about to start when i was in stir -- not with all that leisure time on my hands .
and not with all that buried loot you had waiting for you when you got out . from the wembley staduim job , was n't it ? pink floyd concert receipts . jenny would 've been ... fourteen at the time ?	hardly buried . earning interest , love . earning interest in an offshore account . tidy little premium per annum , that .
here , are n't you gon na let me in .	try calling me again .
... no , i went in for more improving pastimes . philosophy classes , language courses , european history , all that lark . did you know that in paris in the eighteenth century there were more rats in people 's houses than there were people in people 's houses .	sounds like beverly hills .
here , are you always this sarky ?	sarcastic , moi ? maybe i 'll mellow when my ship comes in . it 's expected any day now . i 'm all packed and ready to go .
were n't you on a television series ?	if it played in england somebody owes me money . who told you that -- eddie ?
said it went on for donkey 's years .	three seasons . they found that 's the limit of human tolerance when it comes to following the adventures of a family of mormons on the chisum trail . i was wife number three -- the ingenue .
oh , it just ended , then .	now who 's being sarcastic ?
when you 've lost as many years as i have , love , puts things in perspective , know what i mean .	i 'm sorry . i guess the rest of us have no excuse for wondering where the time went . it must 've been the bars .
i ca n't believe jenny told you all that . about me . she was always so embarrassed .	not embarrassed .
ashamed .	not ashamed .
disappointed .	she never told eddie , though .
she never told anyone else . about the convict strain -- or is it stain ? no , i was privileged . i was someone who helped jenny efface her past .	how 'd you manage that , then .
when i 'm not honing my craft in episodic television i do double-duty as a voice coach . not that her accent would have hobbled her progress . not with that look .	yeah , well , she started all that in london .
modelling .	learnin ' 'ow to speak proper . central school of speech and drama . it 's no doddle gettin ' in there , y'know . at seventeen . they offered her a place at rada n ' all , only she'd 've had to wait till the next session and she was always in hurry to get on , was jenny . she could talk posh without any training , when she was knee-high to a grasshopper . show up the old man , you know .
you were n't disappointed in her , then .	in jenny ? 'course not . how could i be . 'course i was n't .
she was twenty-one when she came to me . ... straight from leaving you .	footloose and fancy free .
when did you get in ?	yesterday . afternoon .
you have n't been lurking outside my building all day .	no , i had -- some other matters to attend to , you know . getting a car sorted ...
i might 've been away for the weekend .	well , i reckoned , saturday night , if you were goin ' out , you 'd probably have to come home first .
and you 've seen eddie rama .	yeah , saw eddie , yeah . me and him are muckers .
i should really give him a call . he 's a character , is n't he . well , not to you . i meant to us squares in the outside world .	he give me your address .
i gave him yours . said , here , you want to write , i think this is a relative . i guess i thought i was being true to jenny . who told me she did n't have a father -- before proceeding of course to tell me why .	well , do n't suppose she did , really , most of her life . on her own after her mum died . aunts and uncles for a time -- and then the bright lights beckoned .
were you still married at the time -- to jenny 's mother , i mean ?	nah , we split up when jenny was six . her second husband done a runner after she got sick . they give me compassionate leave from parkhurst to go visit her in hospital . we were always mates , me and jenny 's mum . i like to think they 're together again now . y'know . heavenly choir .
the address jenny gave me , that was n't a prison , was it ?	nah , accommodation address .
what 's that , like a p.o . box .	something like that , yeah .
i already knew . knew beforehand . when was it supposed to have happened ? -- two o'clock in the morning , eddie said .	that 's what was estimated .
do you even know who terry valentine is ?	well , i gathered something from the article what eddie sent me . some sort of pop music producer , was n't it .
lives high off the hog and waits for the next big thing . like me -- but on a grander scale of failure .	now , you should n't run yourself down . my employer , mr. lindgren --
-- your employer ?	-- mr. lindgren .
who 's mr. lindgren ?	my employer .
what line is he in .	proprietor of a london firm . of longstanding .
i see .	based in london , but with international concerns .
i bet .	various enterprises , style of thing .
i thought you said you never did an honest day 's work in your life .	well , not to say mr. lindgren is dishonest , exactly .
right .	anyhow , he 's always saying to me , dave , never run yourself down , son -- 'cause there 'll always be plenty of people willing to do it for you .
in what capacity are you employed by this mr. lindgren ?	this and that . y'know . ways and means .
so what 's the deal . you and terry valentine at twenty paces . is that what this is about .	why not .
are you serious .	have you ever known me not to be .
you fuckin ' guys and your dicks .	what 'd you want me to do . stay at home , twiddlin ' me thumbs . doing sweet f.a . [ fuck all ] .
you do n't believe it was a car accident .	what do you think .
terry 's never going to give you satisfaction . not the type .	depends , don ' it .
on what . what makes you so certain .	i 'll bloody well ask him .
jenny was supposed to come to my place that night . she called me , asked if she could come over . she and terry had been -- having some trouble . lately . i do n't know about what . on this occasion , it reached some sort of crisis point .	she told you all about my details but not about his . lovely .
how did you come to have my address ? found it , did you . among her things .	you think terry gave me access to her things ? probably sold her clothes .
this town 's been chewing my flesh since ... what we now refer to as `` the early 70 's . '' christ , my past became nostalgia and no one even asked me .	early 70 's . i was away . maidstone . possibly brixton .
you do n't seem bothered .	you do n't know how i 've compromised my standards .
tell us about it .	it 's too involved ; a lifetime of non- involvement . anywhere else i 'd be an interesting little number , here i 'm just sag number forty-eight thousand and one . sag meaning screen actor 's guild .
oh , i was gon na say ...	still , there have been rewards . it 's sunny . and some of the producers who call even have credits .
what did you do ? to make them take the early 70 's away from you .	a jeweller 's up the west end . we tunnelled our way under the shop floor from the public lavatory down the road . filthy work . trouble was , the bloody thing collapsed -- < u > after < /u > we 'd made the grab , 'n all . would you adam n ' eve it .
you mean if they 'd nabbed you before you actually broke and entered you would only have been charged with making a mess .	we were < u > lucky < /u > to be nicked . me and the lads went down there sunday evening , we were n't discovered till the monday . good job we were still breathing .
it did n't discourage you , though .	hey ?
from pursuing your chosen profession .	i 'll tell ya something : it made me a model prisoner . put me right off any escape attempts . tunnel my way to freedom after that experience ? not bloody likely .
i was inside once . i punched a cop at a demo .	did you . what was that in aid of ?
who remembers .	get seven years , did you ?
overnight . what about just now ?	just now ? overnight ?
you < u > have < /u > been away . or is all this just new to you ?	it 's true . has to be said . i got off to a slow start .
i do n't believe it .	honest . did n't know where to look till i was 21 .
-- they want southern , i do southern , they want midwest , i do midwest , they want tall , blonde , and twenty-two , i 'm shit out of luck . one thing i ca n't do is english . americans ca n't . should n't even try . and laurence olivier could n't do us .	you ever been to london ?
only in the movies .	i 've 'ardly ever left it .
yeah , well , you 're here now -- -- where < u > h < /u > urricanes < u > h < /u > ardly ever < u > h < /u > appen .	i 've got the hang of the driving . found this place all right .
not that i recall .	what about your grandmother ?
nah -- she was married to me grandad -- he was as bent as a boomerang -- used to make knuckle-dusters down the shop . crafty old sod .	he alive to see this ?
dropped dead in the stalls in the odeon , muswell hill . watching doris day .	what 'd your father do ?
i guess you 're just habitual .	you sound like my fucking probation officer .
wo n't he be looking for you about now ?	good luck to him . he could n't find his prick if he did n't wear y-fronts .
minor officials bother you , do n't they ?	do us a favor . ca n't even go have a slash without 'em saying , what 're you going in there for ?
i got a steady income -- i 'm on the dole .	a leech on the welfare state in addition . you do n't miss a trick .
last time might as well 've been the first . i remember all the times , do n't i. watching her grow up -- in increments .	she told me you were a ghost in her life . daddy the friendly ghost . coming back to haunt her .
well , she twigged by the time she was eight or nine that daddy was n't in the royal marines or doing scientific research in the jungles of borneo or playing iago in a worldwide tour of othello .	still , you could never ... do what she wanted .
she used to tell me she 'd turn me in . little kid . ten year old . `` if you 're naughty , dad , i 'll tell on ya . '' she did n't want me sent down again , see . when i was planning some job . `` i 'll tell 'em , dad , i promise i will . here , look , i 'm calling the old bill right now '' -- picking up the telephone . i can see her , the phone in her hand . became a sort of joke between us . only it was n't a joke .	she never would have turned you in , not in a million years .
where 's big sur ?	up the coast .
how far ?	i do n't know -- few hours , i guess .
fancy it ?	i could use a vacation . of course , i keep forgetting , for you this < u > is < /u > a vacation .
never thought of that . busman 's holiday .	what 's in big sur ?
that 's where valentine 's scarpered .	how do you know ?
friends and < u > colleagues < /u > .	you ca n't count on very many people , that 's the trouble . number of times a decent job 's been cocked up ...
you 're just on a higher plane , wilson .	too bleeding true , 'n ' it .
there 's one thing i do n't understand . the thing i do n't understand ... is every motherfucking thing you 're saying .	look , mush , you 're the guv'nor here , i can see that , i 'm on your manor now , right . so there 's no need to get out of your pram . i 'm johnny-come-lately to all this . whatever the bollocks between you and this slag valentine , it 's got nothing to do with me . i do n't wan na know .
well , i 'll tell you . i believe this valentine screwed me out of a fair sum of money .	i can well believe it . i 'm sure he has done , son . he 's about as straight as a dog 's hind leg .
but i ca n't be sure . i do n't even know who he is . he 's too insulated . too many layers around him .	your guess is as good as mine , mate . i 'm here on another matter entirely .
yeah , i guess you are .	good job your lot showed up when they did or it would 've been < u > me < /u > for the high jump .
that dude who works for valentine . he 's the one sent those guys after you . you know that .	yeah . should n't wonder . must 've done .
so what 's your beef , pal ?	nothing financial . strictly personal . i can see how all this import-export malarkey might give rise to confusion where i 'm concerned . a foreigner , showing up unexpectedly , like .
it was you . downtown .	eh ?
because that was n't anything to do with me . and suspicion has been cast in my direction . did n't make any sense . choosing those shitheads over me , cutting me out of the deal , then screwing them over too .	no , i can reassure you on that point . valentine was just as surprised by that turn of events as you .
he 'd already grabbed more than his allotted cut . did n't think he 'd be so bold as to take all of it .	all of what ?
of the deal , man .	oh , yeah , right . the deal .
but if you 're mad at him too and he 's mad at you ... that must make us pals .	as you prefer , squire . as you prefer .
in which case i 'll just do what i usually do .	and that is ?
valentine had himself a party , i hear .	my client has already given a statement regarding yesterday 's events .
a < u > statement < /u > ? i would n't mind getting a statement . you see , < u > my < /u > client -- the united states government -- would love to get a statement about a few of the deals going down with your client .	deals ? my client is involved in any number of deals at any given moment . you 'd have to be more specific .
your client have a deal in long beach ? how about downtown ? there 's some folks there -- oh , wait , they 're all dead . any of this ring a bell ?	my client is an entrepreneur . i am his lawyer , not his business manager .
so you would n't have any idea how your client continues to make so much fucking money .	he 's always been very forward-thinking . he invested wisely .
where is he now ?	he had urgent business in the north .
do n't you work with ian ?	ian ?
i could swear i met you with ian at the emi offices in london .	sorry . was n't me .
you sure ?	unless i 'm not who i think i am .
that 's too bad . ian 's got a good thing going over there .	yeah ?
turned that place completely around . 180 degrees .	no kidding .
what i like about ian , he believes in a chain of command , but not a chain of respect , you understand what i 'm saying ?	right . chain of respect . that 's good , that .
yeah . i really admire the guy . well . good to meet you .	yeah . cheers , mate .
yeah , that 's right .	i can never decide what i like better . leaving home , or coming back .
i would have preferred staying home , me .	you 're a reluctant traveller , then .
you 'll be looking forward to getting back , then .	yeah . another little matter needs attending to soon as i return .
been away a lot .	where else ?
out on a oil rig . in the north sea . nine years .	nine years ? is that legal ?
well , time off for good behavior , you know . i should n't have even been there -- it was these other blokes who shoulda gone in my place . i got lumbered with the job they were responsible for . i do n't mind pulling me own cart , but not someone else 's , know what i mean .	but you stuck it out , anyway , all that time .
i had to , did n't i. nothing else for it . then just when i 'd finished my nine years -- my contract -- wallop , i had to bugger off to the states .	sounds like you need a rest .
but first i got ta give these lads a talking to , these geezers what sent me up the river , in a manner of speaking .	the ones whose burden you took upon your own shoulders .
how much .	five thousand .
hey .	i got half .
makin ' trouble for someone ?	yeah .
which kind ?	the forever kind .
ever take a look at the women who work in pet stores ? wow .	good luck .
jesus , are you gay enough or what .	very attractive . good idea . now i < u > really < /u > want to fuck you .
... you can always tell the ones who 'll do anal .	kinda makes you wonder why more people do n't put a bullet through their fuckin ' skulls , does n't it .
looks like they just airbrushed the dick out of his mouth .	why do n't they have tv shows about people whose daily lives you 'd be interested in watching . y'know . like skinny little weakling . or big fat guy . sick old man . family of losers . would n't that be good ?
two blacks and a mexican in a car . who 's driving ?	i do n't know .
maybe she does n't even know the english guy .	avery said she was tight with his daughter .
she 's nice lookin ' .	so what .
i dunno . i just said she 's nice lookin ' .	and i said so what . you think she 's any happier ?
what d'you mean , any happier ?	any happier than any other asshole in life .
straight rotation , no shit , call your shot .	lem me break .
we coulda used the other two-and-a-half grand .	there 's more than a measly few grand in this .
there is ?	something 's on .
what ?	i happen to know more about mr. whatever- his-name-is than he thinks i know about him and his operation .
you do ?	you bet .
like what .	like he 'd never hire me for real . not week-to-week . i do n't have the credentials . he thinks i 'm just a sociopath , someone he can turn to when he needs `` plausible denial . ''
well , we blew it , did n't we ? he ai n't wrong .	`` he ai n't wrong . '' listen , i know this asshole who < u > did < /u > just go to work for him . full-time . and this dickhead 's parents just told me he took a road trip up the coast . < u > that 's < /u > the type of individual gets hired , someone who 'll shoot his mouth off to his family while on the job .
i do n't get it .	i do n't know who that english guy is . some kind of -- -- courier or something . maybe a seller . maybe a buyer . but mr. < u > avery < /u > wanted him , those jigs wanted him -- and i betcha there 's a briefcase somewhere .
what 's in it ?	drugs ? cash ? both if we 're lucky .
how we gon na get that lucky ?	while they 're all fucking each other over ... couple of parties like us could move right in .
how 'd you get in here .	walked .
you walked . what the hell are you doing here .	looking for a bloke named valentine . know him ?
he 's expecting you ?	i doubt it .
so why would he want to see you .	i have a message for him . about jennifer wilson .
you know her ?	yeah . i know her , all right . she came down here once , stirred up a shitstorm . we lost a full day 's work , took me weeks to get back on schedule . if she had n't a ' been terry 's woman i would 've broke her jaw . 'course , she 's nobody 's problem now .
is valentine here ?	what do you think ?
where is he , then ?	listen , get the fuck out of here before you get hurt . who the fuck do you think you are , waltzing in here , asking questions ?
hello there .	what are you doing here ?
exercising my visitation rights .	since when ?
i miss my kids .	they 're at college . or does n't your accountant even tell you where the money goes anymore .
you 've made it ... brighter .	i do n't want you here , terry .
what kind of trouble are you in ?	no trouble .
surely you can think of somewhere else to take one of your chippies for a quick getaway .	susan .
where 's ... what's-his-name -- fred --	-- you know his name is frank .
is he here ?	you know i do n't live with him .
go to him . go to his studio , or writers workshop or artists colony , esselin retreat , nudist camp --	are you finished ?
in a couple of days this whole thing --	who 's looking for you ?
it 's been five minutes and i 'm packing to leave again . i ca n't believe this .	that 's right , your life is shit , and i 'm to blame . it 's that simple .
pleasure .	have we met ? there 's something i ca n't quite --
emi in london . i work with ian .	ah .
you must know ian .	i do n't .
great bloke . really turned things around there . 180 degrees .	i suppose that 's good , unless things were fine the way they were .
thanks . you , too .	be seein ' you .
what .	tell me .
tell you ...	about jenny . tell me about jenny . about the < u > deal < /u > . whatever fucking deal you had to kill my daughter for when she found out about it , you bastard .
she could 've had the deal ! i would 've handed it to her if she wanted . i would have given her everything .	< u > why < /u > then . why did you do it !
hello , ed .	ann . will you come in ?
... i 'm so sorry about your loss .	yes . thank you .
oh , i know . do n't worry , ed . i came to tell you ...	yes , ann ?
yes ?	we went camping last summer . in eugene , oregon . *outside* of eugene , ed .
... yes ?	at night , there were lights -- we both saw them . we never told anyone , outside of our official report .
ann --	a spacecraft . i saw the creatures . they led big dave onto the craft . he never told anyone what they did , outside of his report . of course he told *me* . no one else .
ann --	the government knows . i can not repeat it to you . but this thing goes deep , ed . this was not your wife . i goes deep , and involves the government . there is a great deal of fear . you know how certain circles would find it -- the knowledge -- a threat . they try to limit it , and --
ann , will you come in , sit down , maybe have a drink ?	sometimes knowledge is a curse , ed . after this happened , things changed . big dave ... he never touched me again .
... you do n't like the music out there ?	it 's ok , i guess . no , i do n't really . i 'm not big on music , ordinarily .
hello , rachel .	i 'm so sorry ... i was sorry to hear .
he was deaf when he wrote this .	who ?
hi , mr crane .	hello , birdy . i thought that was very good .
oh , in there ? i messed up a little bit in the scherzo . i guess , if nobody noticed , it 's ok. mr crane , this is tony , a friend of mine . tony , mr crane .	hello , tony .
hello , mr crane .	hello , birdy .
yeah .	we 've certainly missed you .
... or maybe i just have n't played 'em right , i do n't know . but you 're --	pop does n't like people smoking in here .
sure ... sure , it 's his house .	that 's what he keeps telling me .
anyway , uh ... my point is you 're young . a kid really , your whole life ahead of you . but it 's not too soon to start thinking ... to start making opportunities for yourself . before it all washes away .	well , sure , i guess . pop says so too . i work pretty hard at school .
that 's swell . however , the music , if you want to pursue it , well , the lessons from mrs swan , they 'll only take you so far . there 's this guy in san francisco , i 've made inquiries , everybody says he 's the best . trained lots of people who 've gone on to have big concert careers , symphony orchestras , the works . his name is jacques carcanogues . i 'm not sure i 'm pronouncing it right . anyway , he 's a frenchman .	boy .
you 've got talent , anyone could see that . and he 's the best . if he thinks a student has talent , he 'll take 'em on for next to nothing . you 're a cinch to be accepted , i could cover the cost of the lessons , like i said , it 's pretty modest --	oh , mr crane --
i have to do it . i ca n't stand by and watch more things go down the drain . you 're young , you do n't understand .	geez , mr crane , i do n't know . i had n't really thought about a career or stuff .
i know you have n't . look , just go meet him as a favor to me . i talked to this guy . hope i pronounced his name right . he sounded very busy , but he 's not a bad egg ; he loosened up a little when i told him how talented you are . he agreed to see you this saturday . he said maybe you were a diamond in the rough . his words .	geez , mr crane .
... i stank , did n't i ?	he did n't say that .
but more or less .	look , i 'm no expert , but --
it does n't matter , mr crane .	i 'm sure there 's a dozen teachers better than this clown . more qualified . goddamn phony .
... i 'm not certain i 'll have a career at all , and if i do , i 'll probably be a veterinarian .	... uh-huh .
i do appreciate the interest you 've taken , though .	ah ... it 's nothing .
i 'm only sorry that i did n't play better for you . i know it would 've made you happy . you know what you are ?	huh .
you 're an enthusiast .	huh . yeah . maybe ...
... i guess i 've been all wet .	but i do appreciate it , mr crane ...
... i wanted to make you happy .	birdy --
... no , please .	please , mr crane , it 's ok , please --
... you are ze fahzer ?	no . uh ... family friend .
i speak to you on ze phone , non ? you have a special interest in music ?	uh-huh .
ah yes , a music lover .	well , i do n't pretend to be an expert .
... mm .	well ? how 'd she do ?
ze girl ? ... she seems like a very nice girl . she *plays* , monsieur , like a very nice girl . ztinks . very nice girl . however , ztinks .	i do n't understand .
is not so hard to understand . her playing , very polite .	did she make mistakes ?
mistake , no , it says e-flat , she plays e-flat . ping-ping . hit the right note , always . very proper .	i do n't understand , no mistakes , she 's just a kid -- i thought you taught the , uh , the --
... she can go up there .	well , look , i do n't claim to be an expert --
a goose , friend . i was chasing a wild goose . ed , have you ever heard of venture capital ?	uh --
well , it 's the wildest goose there is . risk money . very speculative . except , ed , in certain situations , it 's not , see ? i thought i had a prospect here . well , i make the haul up and this lousy so-and-so tells me his situation has changed -- all his capital 's gon na be tied up in expansion plans of his own . thank you , mother ! pop goes another bubble ! it 's only the biggest business opportunity since henry ford and i ca n't seem to interest a soul !	that right .
it 's called dry cleaning . you heard me right , brother , 'dry cleaning ' -- wash without water , no suds , no tumble , no stress on the clothes . it 's all done with chemicals , friend , and your garments end up crisp and fresh . and here 's the capper : no shrinkage .	huh .
... ed crane . remember ? today ?	sorry , friend , i , uh , you got me at a disadvantage .
i 'm , uh , i 'm -- the barber .	jesus ! the barber ! i 'll be a sonofagun . why did n't you say so ? 'course -- the barber .
... i did n't recognize you without the smock . did i -- damn -- did i leave something at the shop ?	no . i might be interested in that , uh , business proposition --
you got the dough ? !	i can get it , yeah .
come in , come in , siddown over there . coffee ?	no . i -- tell me --
sure .	what 's involved , aside from putting up the money ? what 're you looking for the partner to do ?
do ? hell , nothing . well , you 'll want to keep tabs on your investment , of course , but i 'm looking for a silent partner . i 've done the research , i 've contacted the vendors , the deal is set . i 'm just looking for venture capital , friend . disappear if you want , check in whenever you like -- i want the dough ; i do n't take attendance .	and how do we share --
fifty-fifty , straight down the line . you and me . finance and expertise . so -- you 've got the dough then , do ya ?	i 'll have it in a week .
... it just goes to show , when one door slams shut , another one opens . here 's to ya , uh ...	ed .
... was that a pass ?	maybe .
no problem !	way out of line .
right ! strictly business .	yeah .
... you bring a check ?	cash .
... usually we do this kind of thing with a bank draft . but cash -- that 's fine -- it 's all the same in the end -- dough 's dough , huh ?	sure .
i got the paperwork here . partnership papers here , they reflect our agreement : fifty-fifty on the net , i supply professional services , you supply the capital . i 'll give you a receipt on the dough there , huh ?	yeah .
pretty straightforward , but i do n't know if you wan na show this stuff to a lawyer --	it 's ok .
... just a second here , i 'll give you a receipt on the , uh ... whoa , nellie ... oh , by the way , we did n't talk about this , i , uh , i think i 'm gon na call the place tolliver 's , after me , you know , i did n't think you were much interested in , uh --	that 'll be fine .
... yeah , that 's it . as per our discussion .	uh-huh .
well , there it is . writ large in legal escriture , next step is --	look , uh ... creighton ...
... you 're not gon na screw me on this ?	*screw* you -- jesus ! take it to a lawyer ! no , i insist ! this is *dry* cleaning , this is not some fly-by- night thing here ! i must say , i 've been an entrepreneur for thirteen years and i 've never --
all right .	and i 've never been asked -- look , you want the dough back ? you know who i am ! you --
how ya doin ' , ed ?	ok. take your coat , ann ?
... were you in the service , ed ?	no , dave , i was n't .
... that 's quite a wife you got there .	mm .
she 's a rare one .	how 's business , dave ?
could n't be better . these 're boom times in retailing . we 're opening another store , big dave 's annex , there on garson . this is strictly haberdashery -- casual wear , pyjamas , ladies ' foundations and undergarments . matter of fact , i 'm thinking of making doris the comptroller . how 're things at the , uh , the barbershop ?	all right , i guess .
... say , where do you get those things anyway ?	specialty store down in sacramento .
... ed , i ...	what is it , dave ?
uh-huh .	hell , i , i 'm not proud of it . but , uh , that 's not the worst of it . i got a note . a blackmail note . you know , come across or everybody knows .
uh-huh .	well , you know what that would do to me .
i guess it would be pretty awkward .	awkward ? ! ann 'd throw me out on my keister ! hell , it 's her family 's store -- *her* store . i serve at the indulgence of the goddamn ownership , ed .
uh-huh .	i only work here ! and the lady 's husband would know ... oh , jesus .
how much to they want , dave ?	$ 10,000 ! i do n't know what to do , ed . i do n't know what i *can* do . even though i know who the sonofabitch is .
... you know ... who *who* is ?	the sonofabitch . the blackmailer . it 's , uh , it 's no one you know . it 's a businessman from sacramento . a goddamn pansy , ed . he tried to rope me into some crackpot scheme ; i heard him out and then told him to go to hell . and the very next day , the very next day , ed , i get blackmailed for the same amount .
would he ... it sounds pretty obvious .	well , i guess he do n't care that it 's obvious .
mm . how , uh ... how did he know that --	he 's staying at the hotel i 've gone to with , uh , with the lady in question . must 've seen us .
... oh , jesus .	... why do n't you just pay him , dave ?
that 's my capitalization on the annex ! *my* operation , ed ! christ almighty . that 's what i was just talking to doris about , a way of getting the money from the store that we could hide from ann .	mm .
please , ed .	but it 's ...
your place ?	i 'm at nirdlinger 's . let yourself in .
... dave ?	come on in .
... it ruined me . this money . no annex . i 'm all shot to hell .	so you paid the guy ?
... what kind of man *are* you ?	... huh ?
what kind of man *are* you ?	big dave --
i 'd understand if you 'd walked in here . socked me in the nose . whatever . i deserved it .	i , uh ...
rye .	just coffee .
... does n't become a matter of public record unless there 's foul play . however . i do n't believe i 'm *prohibited* from telling you this . i guess i 'm not obliged to tell you , either . i do n't exactly know . but if *i* were the man , i 'd want to be told .	told what ?
... hell , i hope i 've done the right thing .	my wife and i had not ... performed the sex act in many years .
... my first instinct was , no , no , the whole idea was nuts . but maybe that was the instinct that kept me locked up in the barbershop , nose against the exit , afraid to try turning the knob . what if i could get the money ?	honey ?
where you going ?	me ? us ! the party at nirdlinger 's -- i told you last week , for the christmas push .
come on , get ready . it 's important .	nah , go ahead . i 'm not big on parties .
... what a knucklehead .	who ?
dave .	how 's that ?
... money problems . he 's thinking about canceling the annex .	so ?
*that means i do n't run nirdlinger 's ! *	mm .
... what 's so damn strange about that ?	i did n't say a word .
'gratulations , gina . it 's so goddamn wonderful .	congratulations , gina .
life is so goddamn wonderful , you almost wo n't believe it .	honey ...
honey .	how are you ?
i do n't know what 's going on . i --	what happened to you ?
... i do n't know what happened to big dave . i know some of it . irregularities in my books , they said . can i explain it .	you do n't have to --
i helped him cook the books , ed . i did do that .	you do n't have to tell them anything . we 're getting you a lawyer .
i know all about that . but i do n't know how much to tell them .	do n't tell 'em anything . we 're getting you freddy riedenschneider .
should i ... should i tell you why ?	you do n't have to tell me anything .
... my books used to be perfect . anyone could open them up , make sense of the whole goddamn store .	honey ...
... doris --	nah , do n't say anything . i 'm alright .
look , i do n't wan na waste your time so i 'll eat while we talk . ya mind ? *you* do n't mind . so while i 'm in town i 'll be staying at the hotel metropole , the turandot suite . yeah , it 's goofy , the suites 're named after operas ; room 's ok though , i poked around . i 'm having 'em hold it for me on account of i 'll be back and forth . in addition to my retainer , you 're paying hotel , living expenses , secretarial , private eye if we need to make inquiries , headshrinker should we go that way . we 'll talk about appeals if , as and when . for right now , has she confessed ?	no . of course not . she did n't do it .
good ! that helps . not that she did n't do it , that she did n't confess . of course , there 's ways to deal with a confession , but that 's good ! -- one less thing to think about . now . interview . i 'm seeing her tomorrow . you should be there . three o'clock . one more thing : you keep your mouth shut . i get the lay of the land , i tell *you* what to say . no talking out of school . what 's out of school ? everything 's out of school . i do the talking ; you keep your trap shut . i 'm an attorney , you 're a barber ; you do n't know anything . understood ?	... ok .
i knew about it . big dave told me about it , and the spot he was putting himself in by getting the money .	terrific . your husband backs you up . that 's terrific .
... you 've got ta give me something to work with . freddy riedenschneider is good , but he 's not a magician . he ca n't just wave his little wand in the air and make a plausible defense materialize . look . look at what the other side is gon na run at us . they got the company books , prepared by you -- *cooked* by you -- that 's motive . they got a murder scene *you* had access to . that 's opportunity . they got that little trimmer thing he was stabbed in the throat with -- a *dame's* weapon --	it was big dave 's .
-- do n't interrupt me -- that 's means . they got a fine upstanding pillar of the business community as a victim , and then they got *you* , a disgruntled number-juggling underling who on the day in question was drunk as a skunk and whose alibi for the time in question is being passed out at home , alone .	*i* was with her .
ok , we forget the blackmail . *you* killed him . how come ?	he and doris ... were having an affair .
ok , how did you know ?	i ... just knew . a husband knows .
will anyone else say they knew ?	i do n't know . i do n't think so .
how did you get into the store ?	i took doris 's keys .
will anyone say they saw you there ? on your way there ? in there ? on your was back ?	... i do n't think so .
... i do n't get it .	look , chum , this is a guy , from what i understand , told everybody he was a war hero , right ? island hopping , practically liberated the pacific all by himself with a knife in one hand and a gun in the other and twenty yards of jap guts between his teeth .
yeah .	and now it turns out this dope spent the war sitting on his ass in some boatyard in san diego . you asked for blackmail , let me give you blackmail : mr hale-fellow-well-met , about to open his own business here , has been lying to everybody in this town for the last four years , probably including half the people sitting on that jury . well , it finally caught up with him -- these dopes , it always does ; someone threatened to spill it . somebody knew his dirty little secret , just like your wife says . they called , they demanded money ...
... did big dave mention that it was something about his war service ? i do n't know , i was n't there , *you'll* have to tell *us* . maybe he specified , maybe he did n't ; i 'm not putting words in your mouth ; the point is that this liar , this cynical manipulator , this man who through his lies sneered and belittled the sacrifice and heroism of all our boys who *did* serve and bleed and puke and die on foreign shores , and who made a fool out of this entire town , turns to *you* to help him out of his jam . fat-assed sonofabitch !	so ... who ... who actually --
not guilty , your honor ...	i tried to tell him the whole story , but riedenschneider stopped me . he said the story made his head hurt , and anyway he did n't see any way of using it without putting me on the hot seat for the murder of big dave ...
... i got ta hand it to him , he tossed a lot of sand in their eyes . he talked about how i 'd lost my place in the universe ...	... a puny player on the great world 's stage ...
... how i was too ordinary to be the criminal mastermind the d.a . made me out to be , how there was some greater scheme at work that the state had yet to unravel , and he threw in some of the old truth stuff he had n't had a chance to trot out for doris ...	... who among us is in a position to say ...
... and inflame the passions of these twelve fine men and women ...	... well , he got his mistrial , but the well had run dry . there was nothing left to mortgage ; riedenschneider went home and the court appointed lloyd garroway ...
thanks . thanks for seeing me , at home .	oh , hell . drink ?
no thanks .	sure you do n't need one ?
i 'm fine .	ok. boy . jesus !
yeah . what do i , uh ...	well , of course , i , uh , it 's out of my league , criminal stuff . i do , uh , probate , real estate , title search , uh ... i 'd be absolutely worthless , something like this . absolutely worthless .
'scuse me , just finished dinner . um . frankly , doris 'd be better off with the county defender .	he a good man ?
bert 's ok , sure , he 's a good man . i wo n't kid you though , ed , nobody around here has any experience with this kind of , er ... and i hear they 're bringing a prosecutor up from sacramento . capital offense . taking it seriously ... hmm ...	so --
taking it seriously .	so , who should i --
coffee , ed ?	i 'm fine . thanks .
... so , uh , who should i --	well , there 's lloyd garroway in san francisco . probity -- you know , no one ever said anything iffy about lloyd garroway . conservative . jury might like that . might like that here .
... probity .	uh-huh . is he the best then , for , uh ...
well , the best , the money-is-no-object best , for a criminal case , any lawyer would tell you freddy riedenschneider . out of sacramento . 'course , i do n't know how you 're fixed for money .	uh-huh . he 's the , uh ...
ed , how 're you holding up ?	i 'm ok , walter , thanks .
i 'm so damn sorry about your loss . terrible thing . just damn terrible .	yeah .
birdy 's in the parlor -- i 'm on long distance here .	sure , walter . thanks .
... huh ?	have n't i seen you up in ladies ' wear ?
i do n't work here . my wife does .	uh-huh . some beat , huh ?
yeah .	check out the rack on that broad in the angora .
... did you make that up ?	oh , no . that was written by mr ludwig van beethoven .
that was quite something .	he wrote some beautiful piano sonatas .
that was something . i 'm ed crane .	i know who you are , mr crane .
... i 'm rachel abundas . everyone calls me birdy .	sorry , i just did n't remember .
says here that the russians exploded n a-bomb and there 's not a damn thing we can do about it .	uh-huh .
... ed ?	huh ?
russians exploded an a-bomb .	yeah .
jesus ...	now , being a barber is a lot like being a barman or a soda-jerk ; there 's not much to it once you 've learned the basic moves . for the kids there 's the butch , or the heinie ...
... so you tie your own flies , ed . i mean , if you 're really serious . you tie your own flies , you do a -- i know it 's matickless , i know , people say , hey , you can buy flies at the store -- but you can buy your fish at the store , ed , you see what i 'm saying ?	uh-huh .
the point is there 's a certain art to the process . the point is not merely to provide , and let me point out , these fish are not as dumb as you might think .	uh-huh .
sportsmanship ! that 's my point . june fly , ed ? mosquito ? which of these ? well , what fish do you seek ?	yeah .
... you sure , eddie ?	yeah , yeah -- go home .
frank .	huh ?
this hair .	yeah .
... you ever wonder about it ?	whuddya mean ?
i do n't know ... how it keeps on coming . it just keeps growing .	yeah -- lucky for us , huh , pal ?
no , i mean it 's growing , it 's part of us . and we cut it off . and throw it away .	come on , eddie , you 're gon na scare the kid .
... i 'm gon na take his hair and throw it out in the dirt .	what the --
i 'm gon na mingle it with common house dirt .	what the hell are you talking about ?

this is what family is for , ed ! this is when ya come together !	yeah .
close ranks ! goddamnit ! those sons of bitches !	frank , uh , you know i 'll try to contribute , but , uh -- freddy riedenschneider --
i do n't care what it costs ! this is when ya come together !	that 's very generous .
they 're just people like you and me , ed . remember that .	uh-huh .
just people . they got ta put up the big front so that people will trust them with their money . this is why the big lobby , ed . but they put their pants on one leg at a time . just like you and me .	uh-huh .
... we goin ' ?	huh ? no .
huh ?	they sent us to tell ya . we pulled the detail .
i do n't understand .	he 's the dead guy .
birdy ... i did n't mean to --	what 'd he say ?
'lo , ed .	hello , walter .
mr ... ?	crane . ed crane .
... you 're ed crane ?	yeah --
barber , right ? i 'm freddy riedenschneider . hungry ? they tell me the chow 's ok here . i made some inquiries .	no thanks , i --
... i 'm crane .	my name is diedrickson . county medical examiner .
hello !	hello .
does n't bother me .	well , have you ever considered tar macadam ? people think it 's just for public works and commercial purposes , roads , parking lots , so forth ...
ok , boys , which of you gets the privilege ?	we 're just closing , friend .
oh , happy days ! i wish i was doing well enough to turn away business ! more power to ya , brother ! the public be damned !	hey , what 's your problem , friend ? this is a business establishment with posted hours --
yes , sir .	could you come with me please ?
he 's a barber .	ah .
second chair .	not an owner .
no , he 's family , he 's my brother-in- law .	ah-hah . it would be best if he waited here .
... look , pal , it 's a tough break , but , uh ... well damnit , your wife 's been pinched .	they sent us to tell ya .
yeah , uh , they brung her to the county jail , uh ...	homicide .
... yeah , it 's a tough break .	visiting ends at five . too late today . you can see her tomorrow .
are you awake ? ... is he awake ?	crane ? we have to tell you , as soon as you 're conscious -- is he conscious ?
his eyes are open .	uh ... you 're under arrest .
as soon as the doctor lets us , we got ta move you . does he understand that ? we 're supposed to tell him . are you conscious ?	you 'll go to the prison hospital .
what 'd he say ? does he understand ?	he said ok. is that what he said ?
uh , vince . sorry . this wo n't wait .	it better be good .
there are a couple of kids who were lost yesterday near the site of the murder . claimed they saw a monster . they 're pretty determined to tell you their story . you want to see them ?	no .
manual overrides are n't working . i 'm getting nothing , lieutenant .	great .
there 's some kind of animal loose in the museum . pendergast 's alone . he needs help . i want volunteers to go with me .	i 'm in .
beauregard ! you scared me half to death .	i 'm sorry , sir . you okay ?
someone broke into this room .	anything missin ' ?
looks like the curse is still at work .	the claws are sharp ... i must have cut myself . better move these crates to the secure storage area where they 'll be safe .
do n't know if it 'll do any good , mr. cuthbert .	why not ?
we all love the museum . i come here myself with my kids . we 're trying to work with you .	i appreciate that .
i 'm telling you , something 's wrong . i still have n't heard from pendergast . i think you should call it off .	it 's too late now . guests are arriving . the mayor 's car is pulling up .
i 'll go down and speak to him .	you have n't got the authority . only pendergast can pull the plug .
pendergast may be in trouble . do n't you understand ? he still has n't come back . it 's been over three hours --	he 'll be back . relax . we 're in good shape . your security is air tight . there 've been no more incidents , nothing suspicious . there 's no reason to call off the opening now .
sweet jesus !	get his gun and his walkie talkie , jonathan . move .
my office is on the third floor ! there 's a walk-in safe and a portable phone ! we can lock ourselves in the safe and call for help !	i have to help pendergast . kawakita and jonathan stay with me . the rest of you can go with cuthbert !
i had no idea the museum had a complete collection of piranesi 's forum sketches .	if you like them , they 're for sale . another day like yesterday and half the collection will be on the block .
i 've read about the museum 's financial troubles .	we 've been operating in the red for years . that was the whole idea behind the superstition exhibit . it was designed to pull people in . we 've spent every penny we have on advance publicity , betting everything on the opening 's success . if we postpone at the last minute ... no . i do n't want to think about that .
if the party goes forward , and that 's a big if ... i 've arranged for a large police presence .	do they have to wear uniforms ?
yes .	i do n't want to scare people .
i got it after i was mugged in the subway last spring .	where 's the walk-in safe ?
behind you .	what 's the combination ?
forget it !	calm down . i found it !
battery 's dead . shit .	let 's go !
that thing wo n't come after us , right ? it 's going for bigger game . the group blundering around in the basement . poor fools .	hurry up !
for chrissake , i 'll do it . what 's the combination ? !	to the left twice then five no ... sorry ... i think it 's fifteen ... it 's been a while ...
fifteen ... what 's next ?	eight to the right ! look ! i found it !
this huge police presence tonight is n't necessary , lieutenant . you 'll just scare people off . i can handle the security behind scenes with this system . it 's state of the art .	the cops are non-negotiable , ippolito . why do n't you just tell me how this space station works .
it 's fool proof , basically . i designed this whole thing myself . every valuable object in the museum carries a small electronic chip . if anything 's moved so much as an inch , we get an alarm pinpointing the exact location of the attempted theft .	that 's great if you 're stopping a burglar . not our goal here . are there motion detectors ?
in every exhibition room . the museum 's divided into five cells . the reception and exhibit are in cell five . we could arm the motion detectors in cells one to four , then seal the perimeter with our fire doors .	that would leave one exit for hundreds of people . you 'd be violating every fire regulation on the books . we 'll guard the perimeter with my men and engage the motion detectors in the other cells . one more question . i see a big hole . if this entire thing is run by computer , what happens if the power fails ?
the whole system is shutting down ! we have to get out quickly before the fire doors fall !	what doors ?
i told you ! they seal off all the cells . they were designed to fall automatically in a system failure --	you said the system could n't fail !
ippolito ! get back here !	like hell !
d'agosta ? ippolito . come in .	where the hell are you ?
i made it outside . i 'll co-ordinate the rescue efforts from here . help is on the way . just sit tight .	it 's a little late , you son of a bitch . there 's a friggin ' monster loose in here ! get the fbi , the fire department . find metal cutters , cut through . and bring a cannon . the damn thing is huge .
who are you ? the undertaker ?	special agent pendergast . fbi .
vince d'agosta . am i out ?	not at all . i think we may be working on the same case . if so , i could use your help .
the body ?	what 's left of it .
we need light in here , stat .	where 's the head ?
careful . that mess on the ground is brains .	whose footprints ?
an original roger tory peterson of a red-breasted merganser . amazing . i have a copy of this in my office at home .	ca n't really focus on birds at the moment , pendergast . i 'm tryin ' to keep my breakfast down .
in this violent world , i believe the only way to stay sane is to take time to notice beautiful things .	i drink . after hours of course . on duty , i smoke . do you mind ?
not at all . i enjoy the smell of a good cigar .	then you wo n't like this one . it 's a piece of shit .
lieutenant --	call me vince .
did you read about a boat that washed up outside of new orleans about four months ago ? twelve bodies on board .	who did n't ? big news . out of brazil , was n't it ?
yes . that 's my case . now it 's yours . all the corpses were badly mutilated in a very particular way . decapitated . brains extracted . limbs torn to shreds . it looked like the work of a large animal , but there was no sign of an animal on board .	so the method of death is the only connection ?
if you do n't mind , this could be important .	you 're kidding .
i 've got to admit , that was a damn sight better than `` the dog ate my homework '' .	how do you explain the part about beauregard ?
they heard the victim 's name and wove him into their story . nice touch .	i believed them .
you think what we 've got here is a monster as big as a house that smells ... like hamburger ?	no . i think what we 've got here is a psychotic killer wielding some kind of unusual weapon ... who wants us to believe he 's a monster .
what happened to them ?	if you do n't mind a suggestion , you might try a saliva test .
saliva test ? you mean , you think someone ate part of the brain ?	correct .
i do n't like animals . never have . dog bit me when i was little . after that i gave up on pets . animals are irrational . give me a psychotic killer any day . if there 's one thing that makes me queasy it 's being part of a food chain . my first case as a rookie , two brothers climbed a fence at the zoo . it was late august . over ninety . the polar bear was inside his cave . kids did n't know he was in there . all they saw was the pool . they got to swimming and splashing . the noise woke up the bear . by the time i arrived , both little boys were in pieces . the bear was dragging one kid around by the foot . i can still hear the mother screaming --	this is n't an animal , vince . i 've been on this case four months , remember ? i 've learned a few things .
how big is the sub-basement ?	apparently it 's huge .
i think i should come with you .	we have n't got time . you have to meet with museum security so we can make a decision about tonight .
pendergast ! help ! it 's right behind us !	this door 's locked . try shooting the hinges off .
vince ? there 's no way we can get to you with the fire doors down . there 's an entrance to the sub- basement in the hall off the north side exit .	the sub-basement ?
i smell it . it 's here .	go out the north exit ! there 's a hallway and a false wall by the greek vases . run !
nice to see you , lieutenant .	the sub-basement , huh ? great idea .
this place is a maze .	i 'm one of the few who know every inch it , now that john is gone .
look . it 's some kind of letter .	may i see that ?
did you hear that ? my god . he says that mbwun is real !	pardon my french , but bull shit .
should n't a drug that powerful be destroyed ?	the virus itself might have positive applications . they 'll keep the plants in secure lock up while the studies are made . greg is n't joining us ?
lieutenant ! it 's me .	what is it ?
dr. green has to see you !	got my hands full here .
what happened ? !	there 's a dead body in the exhibit ! people are panicking , trampling each other trying to get out .
it 's still back there !	i know .
how much ammo do we have to make a stand ?	you 're asking me ? i do n't even know how to load this thing .
all right . kawakita , cover the rear .	oh shit .
i believe in you a hundred percent , vince , but that 's the second time we 've been at that intersection .	not so loud .
what 's that ?	all right everybody , hold up !
what does it say ?	dr. john whittlesley .
what 's that doing here ?	i do n't know . i thought dr. whittlesley died in south america .
dear god . where are we , lieutenant ?	i 'd say we 're in its home .
we 've met . the hacksaw murders . '89 .	oh yes ! who could forget . afterwards you sent me that amazing case of chateau lafitte .
i hope you liked it .	lovely bouquet . after our last case , vince took me out for a draft beer . as i recall we split the check .
what are we talking about here ?	someone who makes the hacksaw murderer look like mother teresa .
curious . there 's something missing .	the thalamus and the hypothalamus , perhaps ?
yes . bit of a shock . but as cuthbert so tactfully put it , the museum needs new blood . and since i 've been here since the mesozoic era --	i do n't believe it .
now margo , do n't overreact . cuthbert has to cut costs somehow . my leaving makes perfect sense . this is n't exactly early retirement . i 've overstayed the party a bit .	we ca n't do without you . you 're one of the foremost authorities on primitive pharmacology . you 're practically an institution around here .
please . do n't humiliate me further .	let me help . i can take care of everything .
no , margo . this is one problem you ca n't solve . you have to stay out of it . the fact is , i want to retire .	how can you say that ? you know it 's not true .
yes it is . i 'm tired and i 'm no longer needed --	my work on fossil intermediates would be crippled without you .
with all due respect , dear , that 's bull . you dance rings around me with your new technology . you 've left me in the dust .	your work is highly relevant . what about your display on primitive pharmacology ? cuthbert told me himself he was going to feature it prominently in the superstition exhibit .
come on . i 'll walk you back to the elevator .	i 'm not giving up .
this is n't a death sentence . greg has promised to teach me fly fishing . i 'll garden . i 'll write .	you are this museum . it wo n't be the same without you .
that cuthbert . what a piece of work . someone 's dead and all he cares about is his superstition exhibit .	cuthbert 's counting on the exhibition 's success . the museum is in debt . contributions and public funding have dried up . admissions no longer cover overhead . the last big infusion of cash we had was the king tut exhibit . cuthbert was hired to get us out of the red . if the superstition exhibit is n't lucrative , he 'll have to start auctioning off some of these gems .
i ca n't help thinking there 's something that pendergast overlooked . if the scratches were made by whatever killed beauregard , it wants something that 's in here .	a blow dart . seed pods . a plant press . pretty unimpressive stuff .
what is it ?	i 'm not sure . as you know , the kothoga lived outside civilization on the tepui for thousands of years . species flourished in isolation when man and pollution rendered them extinct . this could be one of the last remaining samples of an unknown plant .
whatever it is , it must be common on the tepui . john used it as packing material .	you 're right .
margo , these are n't seed pods .	what are they ?
like the claw .	let 's not jump to conclusions . this egg could belong to any number of reptiles , dr. frock .
come on , margo . we 're on the verge of something huge . let 's consider the possibility , just the three of us , alone in this room . what if john was right . i mean , what if ? and he sent back an egg of his monster in the crates . when it got to the museum , it hatched .	several problems with that theory . for one thing , this egg is intact . for another , according to pendergast , the crates were shipped here on a boat . everyone on board was killed like beauregard . if the thing hatched in mid-ocean , where did it go ?
look at this . an ambyloid reovirus protein . that explains why the computer 's confused . the plant 's infected with a virus .	that 's not so unusual . many plants carry viruses . like the burls on maple trees .
all right , assuming the program is accurate , this is a description of the animal with that claw . `` species unidentified . genus : unidentified . phylum unknown . male , weight in excess of 240 kg . brain capacity , 900 centimeters . '' that means it 's highly intelligent . `` quadrupedal . ''	quadrupedal ! the other name for mbwun . `` he who walks on all fours . ''
`` nocturnal . external hair and bony plates . locomotor speed 60-70 kilometers . reduced optic chiasm '' ... poor eyesight . `` external mucoid nasal glands , '' ... very keen scent ... `` morphological characteristics : highly robust . aggressiveness : extreme . ''	so the claw came from a huge creature with a preternatural sense of smell and poor eyesight that hunts at night .
with the intelligence of a human being , the speed of a greyhound , and the strength of a grizzly bear .	margo , what you 've just described is a killing machine .
and it 's hungry . it 's been two days since it 's eaten . there are five hundred people arriving right now . the animal hunts at night and it has a keen sense of smell ! all those people in one enclosed space ...	it 's like ringing the dinner bell .
what 's going on ?	some kind of power failure . maybe it 's the storm . do you have a flashlight ?
dr. frock . did you hear that ?	do n't stop now .
what 's that ?	it 's one of the fire doors . good lord , margo . we 're trapped !
none of that matters now . the people upstairs need us . we have to help .	we ca n't . we 've managed to get inside the one place that 's safe . i think we should sit tight and wait for reinforcements . if we go outside , we 're risking more lives . you have to accept it , margo , there 's nothing we can do . the building must be swarming with police by now . it wo n't take long for them to get through the doors .
i 'm coming with you .	no , dr. frock . you ca n't .
come back and get me .	we will .
dr. frock ?	look who 's here , margo .
thank you for taking the time to help us with this , dr. frock .	happy to be useful . it 's rare enough these days . according to security , beauregard put the whittlesley crates in storage area 1012 .
how many storage areas are there ?	they fill seven floors . we have the largest collection of mammals and dinosaurs in the world . just to give you an idea , there are more than three million insects specimens . not to mention amphibians , reptiles , birds , anthropological artifacts , meteorites , minerals and gems . only about five percent of the museum collection is actually on display .
do you mean dr. whittlesley ?	yes . john made quite a study of the whole museum . he had a copy of my original plans .
something tried to get into this room !	and failed . these doors are solid steel .
this means there must be an animal loose in the museum !	i would n't be so sure .
it 's from john . those two arrows were his insignia . it 's addressed to louis moriarty , a patron who financed his expeditions .	read it out loud .
you said john whittlesley made a study of your blueprints of the museum .	yes .
are there any hidden rooms or staircases ? places where someone could hide ?	not really . just the sub-basement .
where is that ?	i do n't know . it was walled over . no one 's been down there in years .
we think it may have something to do with the eggs we found in the crate .	i do n't believe it .
margo , this is too dangerous . you always think you can solve everything . this time you do n't have enough information . the animal might behave in unexpected ways . leave her here with me . do n't put her in danger .	he 's right .
what 's that ?	footsteps !
dr. frock , i was wondering . what happened to the rest of whittlesley 's plants ?	they were sent to the center for disease control in atlanta .
you work here ?	yes , i do .
what do you do ?	i 'm an evolutionary biologist . what do you do ?
nothing . i 'm in third grade . what 's a revolutionary what ch'a ma ' callit ?	evolutionary biologist . i study how life on earth evolved over millions of years .
way cool . then you know where the dinosaurs are .	fourth floor , west wing , but stay with your class .
this room sucks .	she 's never going to take us to see the dinosaurs . that lady said they were on the fourth floor .
we 're not supposed to go back there .	chicken . this is a great short cut .
i do n't want to go this way .	do n't be a wuss . come on .
quiet !	what is it ?
we were just lost , okay ? and we went down this curvy staircase . at the bottom was a big shadow .	big as a house .
not that big .	well almost . depends which house . it smelled like old hamburger , and it made this weird noise .
and it snuffled the ground like a dog .	like this .
it had a long tongue , teeth this big and yellow eyes .	they were green eyes and they were slit like a lizard 's .
they were yellow !	you 're color blind .
hard to read in this light . the ink is so faded .	the dogs have lost the scent , mr. pendergast . maybe we should head back .
they 've got something .	keep the light up . i ca n't see .
shut them up !	heel argo ! hobbes ! heel !
stop !	holy mother , what is that ?
argo ! hobbes !	get back ! now !
there 's something out there ! let 's go get it now ! that 's why we came down here , is n't it ?	he 's right . follow me .
look . it 's hobbes ! he 's all right .	come on . let 's get back to the others . we ca n't leave them alone .
it 's alright . i can tell by the way the dog 's acting that whatever was out there is gone . what is this place ?	not on the map . looks like it connects with the city sewer .
oh ... my ... god !	quiet .
jesus , what is this ?	another storage room .
oh no . i smell it .	keep the animal quiet .
if i spent half the time on my fractal evolution thesis that i spend on this fly rod , i 'd have my phd .	but at what a price .
i have the species identification on these teeth . we can extract dna and start running tests on the extrapolator program . call dr. frock . he wanted a demonstration .	margo , you have n't heard ?
what ?	frock 's been fired .
that 's impossible .	i 'm sorry to be the bearer of bad tidings , but you know me . telegraph . telephone . tell kawakita . i got the definitive word from cuthbert 's secretary . this is dr. frock 's last week .
for once i 'm glad you 're rumor central . what in the world is going on ?	someone 's been murdered . not shot , strangled or stabbed , either . torn limb from limb . there 's talk of a psychotic killer or even an animal .
mbwun .	what 's that ?
what do you make of it , margo ?	it 's not mammalian , that 's for sure . i think it 's reptilian .
turkish gecko , i believe . a lizard .	lizard dna and human dna on the same strand ? impossible . the sample must be contaminated .
what kind of egg is it ?	it 's reptilian .
these plant fibers are loaded with hormones !	what kind of hormones ?
4-monoxytocin is ... `` a hormone secreted by the human hypothalamus gland . ''	try weinstein 's tropic hormone .
this is it . this is what he , or it ... is after ! the plant has high concentrations of the same hormones found in minute quantities in the human brain !	so what ?
pendergast told me the killer extracts and eats the hypothalamus and thalamus of the victim 's brains !	eats them ?
is dr. frock safe !	yes , he 's fine . greg ... take care of yourself !
got to finish this thesis sometime .	how about lunch ?
not today . besides , i think the director of the museum is expecting you .	okay .
special agent pendergast . fbi . forgive me . i guess i was snooping . what is this ?	an invention of mine . it 's a computer program designed to describe the characteristics of a given species from a reading of its dna . i call it the genetic sequence extrapolator .
how does it work ?	with a dna analysis from a fossil you can use this program to tell the species and sex of the animal , whether it was nocturnal , what it ate , how it hunted , how big it was ... you are n't here for a lesson in dna .
somehow , when all this happened ... i knew it would come back to john . is he really dead ?	maybe not .
if he were alive he 'd have contacted me .	you have time to talk ?
dr. whittlesley was last seen in belem , venezuela a week after the rest of his expedition disappeared . a taxi driver drove him to the harbor where he boarded a cargo boat . that boat washed up in my district . everyone on board was killed .	and john ?
disappeared . his body was n't among the victims .	i do n't understand .
john could n't have anything to do with a horrible thing like that . he was a fine man despite his problems --	you loved him .
yes . once . we met at columbia . john held the cadwalader chair in statistical paleontology when i was a grad student there .	you were going to be married .
how did you know that ?	i ran an internet search on dr. whittlesley . got a list of his scholarly articles and the engagement announcement in the times . i also found a record of your restraining order .
that was two years ago . john was still in love with me . he would n't leave me alone .	you were afraid of him , were n't you ?
he was afraid of himself . he tried suicide once . he was ill. manic depressive . he had wild emotional highs and lows . not a happy affliction for a scientist . he 'd been revered in our community . by the end he was a joke .	tell me about the last expedition . what was he looking for ?
a legendary monster called mbwun .	a monster ?
yes . he developed his own theory that he called the calisto effect . it held that evolution was n't always gradual or driven by natural selection . the environment would sometimes cause sudden and grotesque changes which could result in a `` monster species '' . it made no sense . but he felt he had evidence that mbwun was such a monster , living in isolation on the tepui for thousands of years .	what happened ?
no . i 'm all right . i wo n't let this affect me anymore . john would n't get help . his ego endangered the lives of others . his theory came first .	what if whittlesley arrived on the tepui and no monster was there ? was he desperate enough to create one ?
i do n't understand .	something came up in autopsy tonight . imbedded in beauregard 's body we found a claw .
my god . then it was an animal .	i do n't think so . i think we were meant to think it was mbwun . did whittlesley 's monster have claws ?
i do n't know . he sent back a statue that 's supposed to be an exact representation . but i 've never seen it . it 's in the exhibit .	would you mind showing it to me ?
where would we find it ?	i 'm not sure . we should split up . you take that hall and i 'll take this one .
what happened ?	i do n't know .
i heard you calling and i ran after you , but you kept disappearing and i could n't keep up .	you were behind me ? running after me ?
it 's okay , i 'm all right . i remember now ... it was an animal . something large ! i could smell it . it was hunting me . i saw two green eyes in the dark .	where did you see it ?
that 's not what i saw .	all right . if you 're positive .
dr. green ...	i did n't imagine it . i know what i saw . are you sure there are enough men in there ?
they 're all heavily armed .	all right . this is hard for me . i 'm a scientist . i like order and logic . sometimes too much . there 's got to be an explanation . there ca n't be an animal in there . but i saw something .
what was it ?	i do n't know . mr. pendergast . do me a favor . get me a dna readout on that claw .
genetic damage ?	when dna is defective , it often uncontrollably replicates long repeating sequences of the same base pair . viruses can damage dna . so can radiation , certain chemicals . even cancer . let 's let the g.s.e . sort it out . i have to get started . this will take several hours .
pendergast ? are you all right ?	no . i think i 'm hallucinating .
you 're not . where is it ?	gone .
wounded ?	no . a chromium alloy tipped .45 caliber bullet bounced off that thing 's skull like a spit ball . i think it was bothered by my light .
i do n't know how to deal with this . it 's hellish . like nothing i ever saw . i 'm not trained to deal with a monster , a supernatural creature like that .	it 's not supernatural . mbwun is an animal . part lizard , part human , a genetic freak of some kind , like the half-goat , half-sheep they found last year in the jungles of vietnam .
but what can we do ? our guns are useless --	we have the fibers . do n't you see ? the creature is hungry . it wants the hormones in these plants . it would take hundreds of human brains to supply what 's in these fibers . we 're just a poor substitute . to make it stop hunting , we have to give it what it wants .
you 'd slow us down and put margo in danger .	unlock one of the other storage rooms . we 're going upstairs . we 'll leave a trail back to 1012 and try to trap the monster in here .
that was d'agosta .	the planetarium !
is there another way around ?	no . the planetarium is in the next cell . this is one of the fire doors ...
hide quickly !	what are you going to do ?
what is it doing ?	it 's scared of me .
what happened ?	its eyesight is worse than i thought . it could n't see us . and it could n't smell us through the glass .
it did n't want the fibers . what does that mean ?	i think ... it means it 's full .
then it wo n't go after the others ?	no . it 's still hunting , but not for the hormones .
for what ?	i think ... for the pleasure of the kill .
we have to try and draw it off !	how ?
that 's a ptarmigan , feigning a broken wing . the bird pretends to be injured to draw the fox away from its nest !	it 's deceptively simple . like a bruckner symphony or a matisse .
help someone !	oh god ! help !
you smell that ?	it 's coming . run .
we 're not going to make the storage room !	listen to me , pendergast . mbwun 's dna is part homo sapien . in primates , the eye is a direct path to the brain ! if you get a clean shot , there 's only one place you can kill it . shoot it in the eye !
no ! do n't kill him ! pendergast , you were right . it 's john !	what ?
i do n't believe it .	you have to ! listen ! all viruses pass on their own dna . instruct the cells of the host to make more viruses ! this one was different . it inserted a whole array of genes into john . reptile genes , sixty five million years old . those genes remade him ! it 's not his fault !
just like john . he wo n't listen .	i have to shoot .
he has to look here or i wo n't get a clear shot . call him , margo .	i ca n't !
i 'm so glad to see you . what 's the occasion ?	i 'm in town on a case . dropped by to see vince and we thought we 'd see the new display .
i 'm sorry to keep you . how can i help ?	i want to book a flight to fiji .
where exactly ?	< i > fiji. < /i >
< i > where < /i > in fiji ? what island ?	i 'm sorry , er ... the biggest one .
viti levu . for how many ?	one .
when do you want to leave , remembering , of course , you do lose a day on the way there ?	today .
i 'm sorry . i do n't have anything for at least a month .	< i > a month. < /i >
it 's the busy season .	you are a travel agent , are n't you ? `` doris '' ? your job is to help people travel .
i do have a fabulous rate on a cruise ship departing for fiji tomorrow . but you would n't want to do that .	why would n't i ?
i thought you were in a hurry .	that 's right .
you want to book the flight ?	it does n't matter . i 'll make other arrangements .
close up ?	no , hold back ...
why is he in the basement ?	he moved down there after meryl packed up and left .
why was n't i told ? any unpredictable behavior has to be reported . is that the best shot we can get ?	what 's to see ?
what happened down there ?	he was tidying up his garbage . i was going to call you . but half-way through , he gave up and fell asleep .
give me a shot from truman 's ring .	he gave it back to his father .
we 've declared a curfew . everyone else is at first positions .	all prop cars accounted for ?
i 'm sure we 'll get him on this next sweep .	what have we missed ?
we 're not watching the sea .	why would we --
cue music ...	what music ?
he does n't care .	do it !
welcome .	thank you .
the catalyst for the recent dramatic events was of course truman 's father , kirk , and his infiltration onto the show . before we discuss that , it 's worth reminding viewers that this is n't the first time someone from the outside world has tried to reach truman .	we < i > have < /i > had our close calls in the past .
of course , there has n't been anything to compare with this - the first time an intruder has been a former cast member --	-- a dead one at that .
-- and certainly the first time that an intruder has been rewarded with a starring role . i really must congratulate you on writing kirk back in . a master stroke .	since kirk started this whole crisis in truman 's life , i came to the conclusion that he was the only one who could end it .
i understand he 's hardly had a life of his own since he left the show . how did you convince him -- was it the opportunity to be close to truman again ?	that and a fat , new contract .
how < i > do < /i > you intend to explain his twenty- two year absence ?	amnesia .
let 's talk ratings . `` truman '' has always enjoyed top ten status but the huge surge over the last few days -- how do you hope to sustain that audience now that truman appears to have reconciled himself ?	as you know ratings have never been our primary goal . i imagine we 'll lose those voyeurs only interested in witnessing truman 's latest torment . however , i 'm certain that our core audience will remain loyal .
but recent events have been so dramatic , it does raise the perennial question . what keeps us watching this one man twenty-four hours a day - eating , sleeping , working , sitting for hours in contemplation ?	it has to be the reality .
we 've become tired of watching actors give us phony emotions , bored with pyrotechnics and special effects . while the world he inhabits is counterfeit , there 's nothing fake about truman himself . no scripts , no cue cards . it 's not always shakespeare but it 's genuine . that 's how he can support an entire channel .	a window onto the human condition ?
not only does he give us a glimpse of the truth , he gives us a glimpse of ourselves .	but how do you account for the popularity of those eight hours a day when truman sleeps ?
we find many viewers leave him on all night for comfort . have n't you ever watched your child or your lover sleep ?	let 's go to some of those viewers ' calls .
are we talking emmies ?	certainly a nomination .
of course , truman has always been very much in on casting .	as with our own lives , the only people he ca n't cast are his family . otherwise he has final approval , able to elevate an extra into a lead role as was the case with his only real friend , marlon , or alternatively relegate a star to a bit player .
we should remind viewers that truman , especially as a child , presented a challenge for the production .	let me demonstrate some examples .
he was curious from birth - premature by two weeks , as if he could n't wait to get started .	of course , his eagerness to leave his mother 's womb also meant he was the one selected .
in competition with five other unwanted pregnancies - the casting of a show determined by an air date - he was the one who arrived on cue .	who knew that a show originally meant to last one year - `` bringing up baby '' - would turn into a `` cradle to grave '' concept . he is in fact the first child in the world to be legally adopted by a corporation .
that 's correct .	and the show now generates a yearly income equivalent to the gross national product of a small country .
people forget it takes the < i > population < /i > of an entire country to keep the show running .	no , of course not . and since the show runs 24 hours a day with no commercial breaks the staggering profits are all generated from product placement .
yes , everything you see on the show is for sale - from the actors ' wardrobe , food products , to the very homes they live in --	all products carefully chosen and tested by you for quality and aesthetic value .
there 's nothing on the show i do n't use myself .	and it 's all available in the `` truman '' show '' catalogue . operators are standing by .
why do you feel that truman 's never come close to discovering the true nature of his world ?	we accept the reality of the world with which we 're presented . as the show expanded , naturally we were forced to manufacture ways to keep truman in seahaven - demonstrating that every venture is accompanied by a risk .
you 've never actually met truman , yourself . never thought about doing a cameo -- playing a veterinarian , or a priest , something like that ?	i 've been tempted . but i think it 's important to retain objectivity . i would n't want to get emotionally caught up .
we 've learnt about life as truman has and , despite the complaints of a minority , it 's been an overwhelmingly positive experience , for truman and for the viewing public .	let 's take another call . london , england , you 're on `` tru talk . ''
who are you ?	i 'm the creator .
the creator of what ?	a show - that gives hope and joy and inspiration to millions .
< i > a show. < /i > then who am i ?	you 're the star .
nothing was real .	< i > you < /i > were real . that 's what made you you so good to watch .
i have a map .	truman , i 've watched you your whole life . i saw you take your first step , your first word , your first kiss . i know you better than you know yourself . you 're not going to walk out that door --
what 's he doing ?	they removed all physical trace of her but they could n't erase the memory .
the memory of who ?	shhh !
but why did n't he just follow her to fiji ?	because his mother got sick - very sick . he could n't leave her . he 's a kind boy , maybe too kind .
how can they have a child ?	it 's not gon na be his , you idiot .
why not ?	you think she 'd go through with it ?
sure she would .	guess i always thought they 'd adopt .
you take japanese .	oh , yes .
lauren , right ?	that 's right . lauren .
i 'm truman , truman burbank --	-- i 'm not allowed to talk to you .
it 's okay . i probably would n't talk to me either .	i 'm sorry . it 's not up to me .
no ... i , er .	no ? really ? good , i mean , i thought possibly a pizza . how about friday ?
no .	saturday ?
actually , i 'm free sunday .	now .
right now ? we 've got finals tomorrow .	if we do n't go now , it wo n't happen .
well , what do you want to do ?	i think i 've studied enough .
it 's beautiful ! what are you waiting for ?	i ... i ca n't .
i 'm thinking of getting out , marlon .	yeah ? outta what ?
see here , this is us . all the way round here , fiji . you ca n't get any further away before you start coming back . y'know , there are still islands in fiji where no human has ever set foot .	so when are you leaving ?
it 's not that simple . takes money , planning . you ca n't just up and go . oh , i 'm going to do it , do n't worry about that . i 've just got to move slow . pick my moment . bonus time 's just around the corner . soon as i finish the ...	nursery ?
truman , you know , i did think about moving away one time .	yeah , what happened ?
i figured , what 's the point ? i knew i 'd just be taking my problems with me . once the kids came along , it made me look at seahaven with new eyes . i realized , what the hell could be better than this ? i 'm telling you . what you really need is someone to carry on the `` burbank '' name .	you think so ?
you really think it could 've dropped off an airliner ?	sure . it 's halogen . shame it did n't hit you - you could 've sued . you coming for a drink ?
marlon --	-- truman , what are you doing here ?
i 've got to talk to you .	sorry , i 'm way behind .
i 'm onto something , marlon - something big .	are you okay ? you look like shit .
i think i 'm mixed up in something .	< i > mixed up ? < /i > mixed up in what ?
there 's no point in trying to explain it , but a lot of strange things have been happening - elevators that do n't go anywhere , people talking about me on the radio , you know what i mean ?	no . truman , if this is another one of your fantasies ...
i think it 's got something to do with my dad .	your dad ? !
i think he 's alive . i 'll tell you about it later . i 'm definitely being followed .	who ?
it 's hard to tell . they look just like regular people .	how about them ?
could be . beard looks phony . it 's when i 'm unpredictable . they ca n't stand that . that 's why we 've got to get out of here . can you come with me ?	i told you i ca n't .
what 're we doing here , truman ?	this is where it started .
what exactly ?	things . things that does n't fit . maybe i 'm being set up for something . you ever feel like that , marlon ? like your whole life has been building to something ?
no .	when you were hauling chickens for kaiser poultry , what was the furthest you ever went off the island ?
i went all over but i never found a place like this . look at that sunset , truman . it 's perfect .	yeah ...
that 's the `` big guy '' . quite a paintbrush he 's got .	just between you and me , marlon , i 'm going away for a while .
stay where you are !	truman ? it 's me , marlon . i need to talk to you .
i do n't know what to think , marlon . maybe i 'm going out of my mind , but i get the feeling that the world revolves around me somehow .	it 's a lot of world for one man . you sure that 's not wishful thinking , you wishing you 'd made something more of yourself ? christ , truman , who has n't sat on the john and had an imaginary interview on `` seahaven tonight '' ? who has n't wanted to be somebody ?
and the last thing i 'd ever do is lie to you . think about it , truman , if everybody 's in on it , i 'd have to be in on it too . i 'm not in on it , because there is no < i > it. < /i >	so what are you saying , marlon , the whole thing has been in my head -- ?
not the whole thing , truman . you were right about one thing .	what 's that ?
... personally i think the unconquered south face is the only one worth scaling ... of course it 's a 20,000 foot sheer wall of ice but then when did that ever stop me before ? ... naturally , i intend to make the ascent without the benefit of oxygen but also without crampons or even an ice pick ... < i > risks ? < /i > ... ... sure i 'm aware of the risks -- why else do you think i would spend seven years as an adjuster in a life insurance company ... ?	truman , you 're gon na be late !
what 's that ?	it 's a surprise .
well , what do you think ?	they 're ... perfect . thank you .
hi , honey . look at this . it 's a `` chef's-mate . '' dicer , slicer and peeler in one . never needs sharpening . dishwasher safe .	gee , that 's great .
how did it go today ?	a man tripped and fell on a chainsaw . we got three of his fingers back on .
i was hoping we could have a special evening .	i wo n't be late .
where have you been ?	i 've been thinking --
oh , god .	-- i figure we could scrape together eight thousand .
every time you and marlon --	-- we could bum around the world for a year on that .
and then what , truman ? we 'd be back to where we were five years ago . you 're talking like a teenager .	maybe i feel like a teenager .
it 'd be an adventure .	i thought we were going to try for a baby . is n't that enough of an adventure ?
this 'll pass . everybody thinks like this now and then . come to bed .	i think i 'm going to stay up for a while .
what 're you doing down here ?	fixing the mower . i saw my father today .
i know .	how do you know ?
what did you want ?	i made macaroni .
come on , truman . have n't you studied enough ?	i still want to look over a couple of things .
i 'll take you home , angela . why do n't you leave those with us for a while ?	good night , mother .
i have to talk with you . but not here . let 's go for a walk .	i 'm sorry , i 'm late .
what 's the hurry ?	surgery . the elevator disaster downtown on the news last night . cable snapped , a car dropped ten floors . non-union contractors . monsters . we 're starting with an amputation .
arrah !	oh , my god !
what do i do ?	i do n't know --
-- you 're a nurse , are n't you ?	put some butter on it -- or ice ?
i invited marlon and rita for a barbeque sunday . i thought i 'd make my potato salad . remind me --	i wo n't be here sunday .
-- we need more charcoal .	are you listening to a word i 'm saying ?
let 's go now .	what ? !
where shall we go ? where shall we go ? spontaneity is what it 's all about . forget fiji . we ca n't very well drive to fiji , can we ? what about atlantic city ?	you hate gambling .
that 's right . i do , do n't i ?	so why do you want to go ?
because i never have . that 's why you go places , is n't it ?	truman , i think i 'm going to throw up .
blocked at every turn . beautifully synchronized , do n't you agree ?	you blaming me for the traffic ?
truman , that was our house !	i 've changed my mind again . what 's new orleans like this time of year ? mardi gras . or let 's just see where the road takes us .
let me out , truman . you 're not right in the head . you want to destroy yourself , you do it on your own !	i think i 'd like a little company .
it 's hard to go places , is n't it ?	there 's been an accident , truman .
truman , i took the `` hypocrite '' oath !	i bet you did .
truman , what about that sign ?	i 'm sure they 're just exaggerating .
so what do we do for money when we get to new orleans ?	i 've got my seahaven bankcard .
let me get you some help , truman . you 're not well .	why do you want to have a child with me ? you ca n't stand me .
why do n't i make you some of this new mococoa drink ? all natural . cocoa beans from the upper slopes of mount nicaragua . no artificial sweeteners --	-- what the hell are you talking about ? !
what the hell has that got to do with anything ? tell me what 's happening ? !	you 're having a nervous breakdown , that 's what 's happening .
stop this now . i 'll do it . i swear .	do something ...
who were you talking to ? !	you 're the one talking to the walls !
no . you said , `` do something . '' who were you talking to ? tell me !	truman , stop it !
-- what are my plans now ? well , next i 'm thinking of tackling the yuba river in an authentic canoe from the algonquin tribe . -- i 'm talking about the north fork , a class five rapid - only i 'm not going < i > down < /i > the yuba , i 'm going < i > up. < /i > do you honestly think for one minute i 'd go back to some dreary office to rubber stamp meaningless documents ... do you ?	-- truman , you 're gon na be late !
how are you , mother ?	well , i made it through another night .
how 's your hip ?	oh , just so .
you know surprises are n't good for me . you should really call before you come over , dear .	i 've got something to tell you . you 'd better sit down .
you look very pale , truman . are you taking your vitamin d 's ?	i spend half my life out in the sun , mother , why would i need vitamin d ?
it does n't sound insane , truman . i swear i see him ten times a week -- in a hundred faces . i almost hugged a perfect stranger in the salon last thursday .	it was dad , i swear , dressed like a homeless man . and you know what else was really strange ? a businessman and a woman with a little dog appeared from nowhere and forced him onto a bus .
about time they started cleaning up the trash downtown . we do n't want to end up like the rest of the country .	they never found dad 's body -- maybe somehow --
-- darling --	i 'm telling you , if it was n't him , it was his twin . did dad have a brother ?
we ought to be getting you back , mother .	hold on a minute , dear . here 's us at mount rushmore . you remember , truman -- when dad was still with us - that was quite a drive . you slept all the way there .
it looks so small .	things always do -- when you look back .
i 'm looking for my wife -- nurse burbank . it 's important .	i 'm afraid that 's impossible -- she 's in pre-op .
sure . okay . fine . can you pass on a message ?	i 'll try .
tell her , tell her ... i had to go to fiji . i 'll call her when i get there .	when you get to fiji ?
you got it .	fine . i 'll tell her .
now what ?	leak at the plant . they had to shut her down .
is there any way around ?	the whole area 's being evacuated .
well , thank you for your help .	you 're welcome , truman .
they 're coming . any minute .	who ?
they 're going to stop me talking to you .	there 's no one here .
just listen . you remember when you were a little boy , you stood up in class and said you wanted to be an explorer like magellan --	-- how do you know about that ?
-- and your teacher said , `` you 're too late , truman . there 's nothing left to explore . ''	were you there -- how do you know ?
-- it does n't matter . everybody knows about it . they know everything you do . the point is , you got scared .	i do n't understand .
how 's it going , truman ?	not bad . i just won the state lottery .
good . good .	tyrone , what if i said i did n't want meatball today ?
see you tomorrow , truman .	you can count on it .
do you live around here ?	yeah .
not supposed to talk about it .	you 're not supposed to talk about it ? who told you that ?
i think you better tell us .	we do n't even know you .
well , we 're fbi agents .	you 're not fbi agents .
poopy day ?	yup .
what do you do ?	what do i do . i 'm a key figure in an ongoing government charade . an annoyance to my superiors . a joke among my peers . `` spooky , '' they call me . spooky mulder . whose sister was abducted by aliens when he was a kid . who now chases little green men with a badge and a gun , shouting to the heavens and anyone who 'll listen that the fix is in . that our government 's hip to the truth and a part of the conspiracy . that the sky is falling and when it hits it 's gon na be the shitstorm of all time .
i think that about does it , spooky .	does what ?
why do n't you go home to the old lady --	sorry . do n't have one .
what am i doing here ?	you were shot in the head . the bullet broke the flesh on your right brow and glanced off your temporal plate .
they gave you a craniotomy to relieve the pressure from a subdural hematoma . but you 've been unconscious since they brought you in .	when was that ?
scully had a violent reaction to a bee sting --	you called 911. except the call was intercepted .
i need your clothes , byers .	me ?
special agent scully --	i apologize for making you wait -- i 've brought some new evidence with me --
you 've been back to dallas ?	yes .
are you going to let us in on what exactly you 're trying to prove --	that the bombing in dallas may have been to destroy the bodies of those firemen , so their deaths and the reason for them would n't have to be explained --
-- those are very serious allegations , agent scully --	yes . i know .
and you have conclusive evidence of this ? something to tie this claim of yours to the crime --	nothing completely conclusive --
i hope to . we 're working to develop this evidence --	working with ?
what is it you find incredible ?	well ... where would you like me to start ? antarctica is a long way from dallas , agent scully . i ca n't very well submit a report to the attorney general that alleges the links you 've made here . bees and corn crops do not quite fall under the rubric of domestic terrorism .
no , they do n't .	most of what i find in here is lacking a coherent picture of an organization with an attributable motive . i realize you 're very lucky to be alive agent scully . the ordeal you 've endured has clearly affected you -- though the holes in your account leave this panel with little choice but to delete these references from our final report to the justice department . until which time hard evidence becomes available that would give us cause to pursue such an investigation .
you 've got something to show me .	yes .
we brought the atmosphere back down to freezing in order to control the development , which is nothing like we 've ever seen .	brought on by what ?
this man 's still alive .	technically and biologically , though he 'll never recover .
how can this be ?	the developing organism is using his life energy , digesting bone and tissue . we 've just slowed the process .
do you want me to destroy this one , too ? before it gestates ?	no . no ... we need to try our vaccine on it .
and if it 's unsuccessful ?	incinerate it . like the others .
this man 's family will want to see the body laid to rest .	tell them he was trying to save the young boy 's life , and that he died heroically like the other firemen .
of what ?	they seemed to buy our story about the hanta virus . you 'll make sure the families are taken care of financially , along with a sizeable donation to the community . maybe a small roadside memorial .
yes .	we have a situation . the members are assembling .
who called this meeting ?	strughold . he 's just gotten on a plane in tunis .
its effect on the host has changed . the virus no longer just invades the brain as a controlling organism . it 's developed a way to modify the host body .	into what ?
my lateness may have well been absence . a course has already been taken .	there are complications .
do they know ?	mulder was in dallas when we were trying to dispose of evidence . he 's gone back there again . someone has tipped him .
who ?	kurtzweil , we think .
is this dr. kurtzweil 's residence ?	you got some kind of business with him ?
i 'm looking for him .	looking for him for what ?
feds are looking for him , too . real nice business he 's got , huh ?	what 's that ?
you looking for him for some other reason ?	yeah , i had an appointment for a pelvic examination .
you want a call if we turn up kurtzweil ?	no . do n't bother .
i 'm looking for anything out of the ordinary . maybe something from the fema offices where the bodies were found .	we were n't expecting to find those remains , of course . they went right off to washington .
was there anything in those offices that did n't go to d.c. ?	some bone fragments came up in the sift this morning . we thought there 'd been another fatality , but we found out fema had recovered them from an archeological site out of town .
have you examined them ?	no . just fossils , far as i know .
you said you knew the location of the archeological site where these were found .	show you right on a map .
how 's that ?	standing around holding your yank while bombs are exploding .
do i know you ?	no . i 've been watching your career for a good while . back when you were just a promising young agent -- before that .
you follow me out here for a reason ?	yeah , i did .
my name 's kurtzweil . dr. alvin kurtzweil .	i know the name . why ?
how 'd you find me ?	heard you come here now and again . figured you 'd be needing a little drinky tonight .
you a reporter ?	i 'm a doctor , but i think i mentioned that . ob-gyn .
who sent you ?	i came on my own . after reading about the bombing in dallas .
and what 's that ?	s.a.c . darius michaud never tried or intended to defuse the bomb .
he just let it explode .	what 's the question nobody 's asking ? why that building ? why not the federal building ?
the federal building was too well guarded .	no . they put the bomb in the building across the street because it did have federal offices . the federal emergency management agency had a provisional medical quarantine office there . which is where the bodies were found . but that 's the thing ...
those people were already dead .	before the bomb went off ?
michaud was a twenty-two year veteran of the bureau --	michaud was a patriot . the men he 's loyal to know their way around dallas . they blew that building to hide something . maybe something even they could n't predict .
you 're saying they destroyed an entire building to hide the bodies of three firemen ... ?	and one little boy .
i think you 're full of shit .	do you ?
see this bullshit ... ? somebody knows i 'm talking to you .	not according to the men in blue .
what is it ? kiddie porn again ? sexual battery of a patient ? i 've had my license taken away in three states .	they want to discredit you -- for what ?
for what ? because i 'm a dangerous man . because i know too much about the truth .	you mean that apocalyptic trash you write ? i knew your name was familiar . i just did n't know why .
you know my work ?	dr. kurtzweil , i 'm not interested in bigoted ideas about race or genocide . i do n't believe in the elders of zion , the knights templar , the bilderburg group or in a oneworld jew run government --
i was right about dallas . was n't i , agent mulder ?	how ?
i picked up the historical document of the venality and hypocrisy of the american government . the daily newspaper .	you said the firemen and the boy were found in the temporary offices of the federal emergency management agency . why ?
according to the newspaper , fema had been called out to manage an outbreak of the hanta virus . are you familiar with the hanta virus , agent mulder ?	it was a deadly virus spread by field mice in the southwest u.s. several years ago .
and are you familiar with fema ? what the federal emergency management agency 's real power is ? fema allows the white house to suspend constitutional government upon declaration of a national emergency . to create a non-elected government . think about that . what is an agency with such broad sweeping power doing managing a small viral outbreak in suburban texas ?	are you saying it was n't such a small outbreak ?
what was it ?	when we were young men in the military , your father and i were recruited for a project . they told us it was biological warfare . a virus . there were rumors about its origins .
what killed those men ?	what killed them i wo n't even write about . i tell you , they 'd do more than just harass me . they have the future to protect .
i 'll know soon enough .	what killed those men ca n't be identified in simple medical terms . my god , we ca n't even wrap our minds around something as obvious as hiv . we have no context for what killed those men , or any appreciation of the scale in which it will be unleashed in the future . of how it will be transmitted ; of the environmental factors involved .
a plague ?	the plague to end all plagues , agent mulder . a silent weapon for a quiet war . the systematic release of an indiscriminate organism for which the men who will bring it on still have no cure . they 've been working on this for fifty years . while the rest of the world was fighting gooks and commies these men have been secretly negotiating a planned armageddon .
negotiating with whom ?	i think you know . the timetable has been set . it will happen on a holiday , when people are away from their homes . when our elected officials are at their resorts or out of the country . the president will declare a state of emergency , at which time all federal agencies , all government will come under the power of the federal emergency management agency . fema , agent mulder . the secret government .
and they tell me i 'm paranoid .	something 's gone wrong -- something unanticipated . go back to dallas and dig . or you 're only going to find out like the rest of the country , agent mulder . when it 's too late .
how can i reach you ?	you ca n't .
you found something ?	yes . on the texas border . some kind of experiment . something they excavated was brought there in tanker trucks .
what ?	i 'm not sure . a virus --
-- you saw this experiment ?	what did it look like ?
what do you think ?	a transportation system . transgenic crops . the pollen genetically altered to carry a virus .
that would be my guess .	your guess ?
you told me you had answers .	yeah , well i do n't have them all .
you 've been using me --	i 've been using you ? !
you did n't know my father --	i told you -- he and i were old friends --
you 'd be shit out of luck if not for me . you saw what you saw because i led you to it . i 'm putting my ass on the line for you .	your ass ? i just got chased across texas by two black helicopters .
mulder -- it 's me --	where are you , scully ?
i 'm on the roof .	did you find something ?
no . i have n't .	what 's wrong , scully ?
i 've just climbed twelve floors . i 'm hot and thirsty and i 'm wondering , to be honest , what i 'm doing here .	you 're looking for a bomb .
i know that . but the threat was called in for the federal building across the street .	i think they have that covered .
mulder ... ?	what happened to playing a hunch ?
jesus , mulder ...	the element of surprise , scully . random acts of unpredictability . if we fail to anticipate the unforeseen or expect the unexpected in a universe of infinite possibilities , we find ourselves at the mercy of anyone or anything that can not be programmed , categorized or easily referenced ...
i know you 're bored in this assignment , but unconventional thinking is only going to get you into trouble now .	how 's that ?
you 've got to quit looking for what is n't there . they 've closed the x-files . there 's procedure to be followed here . protocol .	what do you say we call in a bomb threat for houston . i think it 's free beer night at the astrodome .
now what ?	it 's locked ?
had you .	no you did n't .
i saw your face , mulder . there was a moment of panic .	panic ? have you ever seen me panic , scully ?
alright ... what 'll it be : coke , pepsi ? a saline iv ?	something sweet .
scully ...	scully , i found the bomb .
where are you , mulder ?	i 'm in the vending room .
scully , get somebody to open this door .	nice try , mulder .
mulder ? tell me this is a joke .	thirteen fifty nine , thirteen fifty eight , thirteen fifty seven ...
... thirteen fifty six ...	hang on . i 'm gon na get you out of there .
scully ?	mulder . move away from the door . we 're coming through it .
something 's not right ...	-- mulder ! get in the car !
whatever you told them in there , you do n't have to protect me .	all i told them was the truth .
they 're trying to divide us on this , scully . we ca n't let them .	they have divided us , mulder . they 're splitting us up .
what ? what are you talking about ?	i meet with the opr day after tomorrow for remediation and reassignment ...
why ?	i think you must have an idea . they cited a history of problems relating back to 1993 .
they were the ones that put us together .	because they wanted me to invalidate your work , your investigations into the paranormal . but i think this goes deeper than that .
this is n't about you , scully . they 're doing this to me .	they 're not doing this , mulder . i left behind a career in medicine because i thought i might make a difference at the fbi . when they recruited me they told me women made up nine percent of the bureau . i felt this was not an impediment , but an opportunity to distinguish myself . but it has n't turned out that way . and now , if i were to be transferred to omaha , or wichita or some field office where i 'm sure i could rise , it just does n't hold the interest for me it once did . not after what i 've seen and done .
you 're ... quitting ?	there 's really no reason left for me to stay anymore . maybe you should ask yourself if your heart 's still in it , too .
i wake you ?	no .
are you drunk , mulder ?	i was until about an hour ago .
what are you implying , scully ?	i thought you may have gotten drunk and decided to come here to talk me out of quitting .
go home , mulder . it 's late .	get dressed , scully .
mulder -- what are you doing ?	just get dressed . i 'll explain on the way .
this is one of the firemen who died in dallas ?	according to this tag .
it 's like jelly .	there 's some kind of cellular breakdown . it 's completely edematous .
and there 's been no autopsy performed . there 's no y incision here ; no internal exam .	you 're telling me the cause of death on the report is false . that this man did n't die from an explosion , or from flying debris .
you knew this man did n't die at the bomb site before we got here .	i 'd been told as much .
you 're saying the bombing was a cover-up . of what ?	i do n't know . but i have a hunch what you 're going to find here is n't anything that can be categorized or easily referenced .
mulder , this is going to take some time , and somebody 's going to figure out soon enough we 're not even supposed to be here . i 'm in serious violation of medical ethics .	we 're being blamed for these deaths . scully , i want to know what this man died of . do n't you ?
why are you whispering ?	i ca n't really talk right now .
what did you find ?	evidence of a massive infection .
what kind of infection ?	i do n't know .
scully -- listen to me . i 'm going home , then i 'm booking a flight to dallas . i 'm getting you a ticket , too .	mulder --
i need you there with me . i need your expertise on this . the bomb we found was meant to destroy those bodies and whatever they were infected by .	i 've got a hearing tomorrow --
-- i 'll have you back for it , scully . maybe with evidence that could blow that meeting away .	mulder -- i ca n't -- i 'm already way past the point of common sense here --
you said you were n't coming ?	i was n't planning on it . particularly after spending a half hour in cold storage this morning . but i got a better look at the blood and tissue samples i took from the firemen .
what did you find ?	something i could n't show to anyone else . not without more information . and not without causing the kind of attention i 'd just as soon avoid right now . the virus those men were infected with contains a protein coat i 've never seen before . what it did to them it did extremely fast . and unlike the aids virus or any other aggressive strain , it survives very nicely outside the body .
how was it contracted ?	that i do n't know . but if it 's through simple contact of blood to blood , and if it does n't respond to conventional treatments , it could be a serious health threat .
he did n't mention a park .	this is where he marked on the map , scully . where he says those fossils were unearthed .
you 're sure the fossils you looked at showed the same signs of deterioration you saw in the fireman 's body in the morgue ?	the bone was porous , as if the virus of the causative microbe were digesting it .
and you 've never seen anything like that ?	no . it did n't show up on any of the immunohistochemical tests --
this looks like new grass to you ?	it looks pretty green for this climate .
ground 's dry about an inch down . somebody just laid this down . very recently , i 'd say .	all the equipment is brand new .
unmarked tanker trucks ... what are archaeologists hauling out in tanker trucks ?	i do n't know , mulder .
and where are they going with it ?	that 's the first question to answer , if we 're going to find them .
what are my choices ?	about a hundred miles of nothing in each direction .
where would they be going ?	we 've got two choices . one of them is wrong .
you think they went left ?	i do n't know why i think they went right .
hey , i was right about the bomb , was n't i ?	this is great . this is fitting .
what ?	i 've got to be in washington d.c. in eleven hours for a hearing -- the outcome of which might possibly affect one of the biggest decisions of my life . and here i am standing out in the middle of nowhere texas , chasing phantom tanker trucks .
we 're not chasing trucks , we 're chasing evidence --	-- of what exactly ? !
that bomb in dallas was allowed to go off , to hide something : bodies infected with a virus you detected yourself .	they haul gas in tanker trucks , they haul oil in tanker trucks -- they do n't haul viruses in tanker trucks .
yeah , well they may this one .	what do you mean by haul ? what are you not telling me here ?
this virus -- it ...	mulder --
it may be extraterrestrial .	i do n't believe this . i do n't fucking believe this . y'know , i 've been here ... i 've been here one too many times with you , mulder .
been where ?	pounding down some dirt road in the middle of the night . chasing some elusive truth on a dim hope , only to find myself standing right where i am right now : at another dead end --
what do you think it is ?	i have no idea .
this is weird , mulder .	very weird .
any thoughts on why anybody 'd be growing corn in the middle of the desert ?	not unless those are giant jiffy pop containers out there .
cool in here . temperature 's being regulated .	for the purpose of what ?
you hear that ?	i hear the humming . like electricity . high voltage maybe .
scully ... . ?	yeah ... ?
what are you doing ?	come on !
where 'd they go ?	i do n't know .
what ? what 's wrong ?	salt lake city , utah . transfer effective immediately .
i already gave skinner my letter of resignation .	you ca n't quit , scully .
i can , mulder . i debated whether or not to even tell you in person , because i knew --	we 're close to something here -- we 're on the verge --
you 're on the verge , mulder -- please do n't do this to me --	after what you saw last night -- after all you 've seen -- you ca n't just walk away --
i have . i did . it 's done .	just like that --
i 'm contacting the state board monday to file medical reinstatement papers --	i need you on this , scully --
why was i assigned to you ? to debunk your work . to reign you in . to shut you down .	you saved me , scully . as different and frustrating as it 's been sometimes , your goddamn strict rationalism and science have saved me a thousand times ; have kept me honest and made me whole . i owe you so much , scully , and you owe me nothing . i do n't want to do this without you . i do n't know if i can . if i quit now , they win .
what ? what happened ?	i think ... something stung me .
scully ...	something 's wrong ... i 'm having -- lancinating pain -- my chest . my ... motor functions are being affected . i 'm ...
... my pulse feels thready and i 've got a funny taste in the back of my throat .	i think you 're in anaphylactic shock --
scully --	i 've got no allergy . something ... this ... mulder ... i think ... i think you should call an ambulance .
cold ...	hang on . i 'm going to get you out of here .
we 've got to keep moving .	where are we ?
i ca n't go any farther .	yes you can . you 're going to make it , scully .
we 're going to the morgue .	that area is currently off limits to anyone other than authorized medical personnel .
on whose orders ?	general mcaddie 's .
general mcaddie is who requested our coming here . we were awakened at three am and told to get down here immediately .	i do n't know anything about that .
well , call general mcaddie .	i do n't have his number .
why do n't you go on ahead head and i 'll confirm authorization .	thank you .
sit down , they 're still talking to agent scully .	about what ?
-- they 're asking her for a narrative . they want to know why she was in the wrong building .	she was with me .
you do n't see what 's going on here , do you ? there 's four hundred million dollars in damage to the city of dallas . lives have been lost . no suspects have been named . so the story being shaped is this could have been prevented . that the fbi did n't do its job .	and they want to blame us ?
agent mulder -- we both know that if you and agent scully had n't taken the initiative to search the adjacent building , you could have multiplied the fatalities by a hundred --	but it 's not the lives we saved . it 's the lives we did n't .
-- if it looks bad , it 's bad for the fbi --	-- if they want someone to blame , they can blame me . agent scully does n't deserve this .
she 's in there right now saying the same thing about you .	i breached protocol . i broke contact with the s.a.c . i ignored a primary tactical rule and left him alone with the device .
agent mulder --	where 's scully ? !
she 's missing . we 've been unable to locate her or the vehicle they took her in .	whoever they are -- this goes right back to dallas -- it goes right back to the bombing --
i know . agent scully reported your suspicions to opr . on the basis of her report , i sent techs over to s.a.c . michaud 's apartment . they picked up pstn residues on his personal effects consistent with the construction of the vending machine device in dallas .	how deep does this go ?
are we being watched ?	i 'm not taking any chances .
what are you doing ?	i 've got to find scully .
mr. mulder .	what happened to kurtzweil ?
where 's scully ?	i have answers for you .
is she alive ?	yes .
i 'm quite prepared to tell you everything , though there is n't much you have n't guessed .	about the conspiracy ?
i think of it as an agreement . a word your father liked to use .	i want to know where scully is .
what is it ?	a weak vaccine against the virus agent scully has been infected with . it must be administered with ninety six hours .
you 're lying .	no . though i have no way to prove otherwise . the virus is extraterrestrial . we know very little about it , except that it is the original inhabitant of this planet .
a virus ?	a simple , unstoppable lifeform . what is a virus but a colonizing force that can not be defeated ? living in a cave , underground , until it mutates . and attacks .
this is what you 've been conspiring to conceal ? a disease ?	no ! for god sake you 've got it all backwards .
aids , the ebola virus -- on the evolutionary scale they are newborns . this virus walked the planet long before the dinosaurs .	what do you mean , walked ?
until dallas , we believed the virus was simply a controlling organism . that mass infection would make us a slave race .	that 's why you bombed the building . the infected firemen , the boy --
but ... he sacrificed his own daughter . my sister , samantha .	the only true survivors of the viral holocaust will be those immune to it : those vaccinated against it and human/alien hybrids . your father arranged for your sister 's abduction . he allowed her to be taken to an alien hybrid program , so that she would survive . as a clone . he had different hopes for you . that you would uncover the truth about the project . that you would stop it . that you would fight the future .
why are you telling me this ?	i thought it only fair you should know , given how hard you 've worked .
what happened to kurtzweil ?	as your father knew , things need to be sacrificed to the future .
where is he ?	dr. kurtzweil is in the trunk .
let me out . stop the car .	driver .
you have precious little time . what i 've given you the alien colonists have no idea exists . you hold in your hand the power to end the project .	how ?
the vaccine you hold is the only defense against the virus . its introduction into an alien environment may have the power to destroy the delicate plans we 've so assiduously protected for the last fifty years . or it may not .	what alien environment ?
find agent scully . save her . only her science can save the future .	what about you ?
we began to worry . some of us have traveled so far , and you are the last to arrive .	i 'm sorry . my grandson fell and broke his leg .
more concerns than that ?	we 've been forced to reassess our role in colonization by new facts of biology which have presented themselves .
my god ...	the geometry of mass infection presents certain conceptual re-evaluations for us . about our place in their colonization .
we 're going to tell them what we 've found . what we 've learned . turn over a body infected with the gestating organism .	in hope of what ? learning that it 's true ? ! that we are nothing more than digestives for the creation of a new race of alien lifeforms ? !
let me remind you who is the new race . and who is the old . what could be gained by withholding anything from them ; by pretending to ignorance ? our knowledge may forestall their plans to step up the timetable . to start colonization early .	and if it does n't ? by cooperating now we 're but beggars to our demise ! our ignorance was in cooperating with the colonists at all .
our vaccine may have no effect !	well , without a cure for the virus , we 're nothing more than digestives anyway .
we 've allowed this man his freedom . his books have actually helped us to facilitate plausible denial . has he outlived his usefulness to us ?	no one believes kurtzweil or his books . he 's a toiler . a crank .
you ca n't kill mulder . he 's got too much light on him .	you need not kill a man to destroy him .
sing a song of sixpence ...	a pocketful of rye ...
did we go sailing ?	almost . mocky-lock showed up .
`` mocky-lock is the bogeyman , mocky-lock wants me where i am . ''	mocky-lock is a pain in the ass .
he hates me .	lucien baines ?
she adores you .	she thinks i can bring edward back .
we 've been over this a dozen times . no .	why not ? just once . a trial run . what harm could it do ?
miriam ...	shush .
he creates the obstacles , he decides which games to play .	i 've heard this argument before . it 's not happening .
it could take years for me to get past the barriers he 's created .	if we reverse the feed and bring edward into your mind , it could be devastating for him . imagine the shock of suddenly existing in a whole other world .
i do it all the time !	yes , but , you 're a willing participant . picture edward in a strange place , lost , frightened ...
i 'd be there for him .	and he might blame you for terrifying him . that one moment could erase all you 've accomplished . and if that happened , the trust he has in you is gone .
you 're sure ? any more nightmares ?	no .
good . we need you healthy and relaxed . you 're going to eat well , meditate , exercise , and watch mindless television .	yes mother .
do n't bring it home in this .	okay .
henry wants me to try this vietnamese place he 's wild about . want to come ?	i 've got to feed my cat . besides , i want to get to bed early .
sing a song of sixpence .	a pocketful of fucking rye . what 's wrong ?
nothing .	why did we stop ?
the first ... what ? six or seven times i went in . remember what happened ?	disorientation , nausea , migraines , hallucinations , insomnia , paranoia .
like a new year 's day hangover .	he needs to be turned over .
this is n't your responsibility . remember that . do n't let them use guilt as a tool . if you want to stop , say so .	i 'll be fine .
catherine ? i 'm about to start . if you want me to wait , or ...	no . no .
is it cold in here ?	what happened ?
... a pocketful of rye .	four and twenty blackbirds ...
damn him .	what 's wrong ?
i refilled the zyprexa and atavan ...	i do n't need them anymore ...
i 'll come by tomorrow after work . with dinner .	thanks miriam . say hi to henry and ...
... give a kiss to edward .	give a kiss to edward .
what if he was n't like this ? what if he was `` normal ? '' conscious . how far would you go ?	as far as i needed .
there 's always a chance they 'll confess .	really ? i do n't work with violent cases , i work with children . but even a kid lies . they love it when they get you to believe something that is n't true . do n't you think stargher would do the same ?
sometimes ... once they 've been caught they feel a need for disclosure . they have so much they want to tell . but they 've never had a sympathetic ear . they need someone to understand why . stargher used to hide the bodies very carefully . it was part of the ritual . some were n't found for weeks and any physical evidence had been meticulously wiped clean . but these last three ... they were still in water - always in water - but listen , he was n't just careless . it went beyond that ...	okay . let 's assume he wanted you to find him , that some part of him hated what he was doing ... most likely , that part is dead . schizophrenics with whalen 's infraction sever all ties with the real world . i 'm sorry , i really am .
i still do n't understand why i ca n't do this ... this is n't some `` troubled kid '' you 're dealing with .	i realize that ...
this man is deeply disturbed , he ...	you do n't know the procedure .
edward baines , i presume . hi , ed . i 'm pete .	do you think that 's funny ?
i read about a woman in texas who was in a coma for seven years . every time her husband came to visit , her heart would beat faster . is n't that something ? i do n't know what name scientists have for something like that ...	it does n't have much to do with science .
what then ?	the soul . the spirit . whatever you want to call it .
agent novak ?	peter , okay ?
absolutely . i suppose everyone does .	just like we all have fantasies , right ? things only we know , that we do n't share .
with stargher i saw things ...	what did you see ?
why 'd you bring him here ?	you 're the shrink , you tell me .
you thought stargher wanted to be caught .	i did , yeah .
what about julia ?	this is going to sound terrible , but ... i do n't think she matters anymore . not to him . he never finished her . the others ... he was able to make them his .
you think you can do this , do n't you ?	he might tell me about julia . the part of him that wants to help , that feels shame and remorse . who wants to be redeemed .
this is stargher we 're talking about ?	not stargher , not really . he 's split himself right down the middle . good/evil , right/wrong , merciful/cruel . a monster . and an innocent child . if i could reach the boy .
whoa . hold on . are n't they the same guy ?	do n't you feel there are different sides to every personality ? maybe even the worst of us is capable of one decent act . we 're all human .
it 's hard for me to see stargher as human , capable of something like `` remorse . ''	then what is he ?
evil .	if you believe that .
maybe this is a big fucking waste of time .	what happened to charles gish ?
what happened ?	what difference does it make ... ?
a child can experience abuse worse than charlie 's . and grow up to be someone who would never , ever hurt another living thing .	you 're sure of that ?
remember , julia hickson is priority number one . nothing else matters . find out where she is .	okay , okay ...
wait ...	like hell `` wait . ''
he wants us to follow . the little boy ...	little boy ? ! that 's him !
where the hell are we ?	carl , do you know ? like on a map ...
come on !	i ca n't leave him !
that went well .	give her a minute . hello , valentine .
you sure about this ?	absolutely . abigail ...
i heard julia and john got married .	yep . eloped .
well look at that .	i told you . you have to be optimistic . believe in them ...
he 's mine ?	all yours . my boss says it 's one of the strangest requests the bureau 's ever had .
he also says that until proven differently , julia hickson was found as a result of good old-fashioned detective work .	it does n't matter ...
they 're hungry .	i got it .
thank you .	no problem .
you liked him ?	he 's beautiful ...
what now ?	's broken .
who says ?	mocky-lock .
oh no ... no you do n't .	`` mocky-lock is the bogeyman . mocky-lock wants me where i am . ''
she the one from santa cruz ?	just graduated law school . single mom . had a two-year-old daughter .
agent cole .	i need you to find something in the basement ...
already there .	that hoist , with the winch ...
lattimer sold the hoist to a guy named bainbridge who tired to build a machine works out near delano . bainbridge ends up in bankruptcy court and the state winds up with the land - it 's just sitting there .	delano ?
yep . and guess who they hired to seal up the place ?	you 're kidding me .
should n't we get a catheter in him ?	they took care of that , thank you , henry .
not a gift . a highly evolved area in her cerebral cortex , that 's all . a genetic fluke .	catherine has a tremendous capacity for empathy . when we started , there were a number of test subjects - other therapists - who acted as `` receivers . '' all they did was observe and report . nothing more . but catherine , she had the ability to feel what was happening . she understood . and the patient responded . edward engaged her in dialogue , took her places , showed her things . he knew she cared .
intravenous administration complete .	initiating connection .
that 's why we monitor the use of the drugs so closely . we do n't want her getting to that degree of perceptual disorientation .	pump in two liters of pure oxygen , please henry .
i hate to admit it , but there 's something perversely satisfying about this .	i think that 's the whole point .
she changed the codes .	what 's wrong ?
instead of going into his mind ...	she 's bringing stargher into hers .
when did he lapse into the coma ?	sometime yesterday morning .
what about the legalities of this ... ?	stargher is in custody . the functional equivalent of being under arrest . normally , we 'd mirandize him , and if he did n't lawyer up , we 'd interrogate him . but because of his condition , he does n't have the capacity to waive those rights .
catherine !	i 'll get her ...
when we got here , you just topped and pulled her out .	that was with edward . she 's accustomed to his world . stargher 's mind is unfamiliar territory . she 's `` lost . '' someone has to go in . remind her what 's really happening . and get her out . until then , she 's at his mercy .
into stargher . inside ...	yes .
i have done this , you know . been inside .	no .
nervous ?	absolutely .
i have to ask you some things ... are you taking any prescription drugs ?	prevacid . for my stomach .
any psychiatric medication ?	no .
what about narcotics ?	no .
i know your partner 's here , but it 's very important that you 're honest .	i am . i 'm a pretty boring guy .
is she alright ?	yes . but you 're going to sit down right now . i have to ...
agent novak .	dr. kent .
you 're looking well .	thanks you . six weeks off does a body good . i heard she got the approval to try the reversal with edward .
that 's a secret .	federal bureau of investigation , ma'am . we know all , see all ...
how 's the patient .	awaiting his arrival .
what about the cat ?	completely unaware .
someone looking after her little girl ?	grandparents . live over in davis .
so ?	anne vicksey did n't own a dog .
i need it .	now ?
the dog 's an albino . he 'd love an animal like that .	gentlemen , i believe an albino dog is rare indeed .
the phoenix office tested that hair thirty minutes ago . and we got the match .	it 's his dog .
how is she ?	pregnant . thanks for asking .
here he is .	damn , man , i give up . your partner tells you his wife 's gon na have a baby , and all you care about is a coroner 's report !
breeders typically destroy albino pups , so this animal is truly unique .	nicole labetzki . victim seven . forensics found dog hair in her car , but they had a k-9 unit at the scene and never had it checked .
after three years she remembers what the guy drove ?	she remembers because it was her `` dream truck . '' wanted one just like it .
we proceed assuming she is .	let 's give old carl a call . tell him he 's got company .
we 'll go back to his house , pete . there 's still a lot to do . analyze the videos , track sales of the bleach , go through his records . maybe he owns property somewhere .	they 're in that fucking thing for forty hours , gordon . four-oh . he got julia at seven-thirty last night . you know what time it is now ... ? !
you sure you want to go through with this ?	what else do we do ? !
i do n't know , pete , but for god 's sake ... this is nuts . do you really understand what they 're going to do ?	i do n't have to .
why jeopardize what we 've already done ? we caught the sonofabitch . carl stargher . that 's going to be like bundy , gacy , dahmer . a case that makes careers . but if we push our luck . if this is all bullshit and we come out smelling like it .	tell you what . if this thing burns us , i take that heat . i give you permission to point your finger at me and say `` it was all his idea . ''
right here .	next time , tell me , okay ?
jesus christ , man , you look like hell .	considering where i 've been ...
you 're bettin ' the farm on something you saw after they pumped you full of god knows-what kind of shit ?	i saw her . julia . alive . i saw everything .
ich weiss nicht .	das mussen sie doch wissen . ich meine ohne grund wird die politzei doch nicht ins hans komme fraulein schmidt , ein schande ...
den leuten .	ja , ja , ja .
hier sind fruher fursten ans unt eingeganger . hier hat sogar ein metternich verkehrt ...	give her some cigarettes .
warscheinlich ist der murder .	they think you did it .
thank you .	sit down .
you were awfully good .	do you understand german ?
but i could follow it fine . perhaps harry told you about me . my name 's holly martins .	no , he never told me about his friends . would you like some tea ?
well , i saw you at the funeral .	i 'm so sorry , i did n't notice much .
you were in love with him , were n't you ?	i do n't know . how can you know a thing like that afterwards . i do n't know anything any more .
oh , american , thank you . i like them .	i was talking to another friend of harry 's . a baron kurtz - do you know him ?
no .	he has a little dog .
do n't understand what harry saw in a fellow like that .	that was the man that brought me some money when harry died . he said harry had been anxious at the last moment .
he said he remembered me too . seems to show he was n't in much pain .	dr. winkel told me that .
dr. winkel ? who is he ?	the doctor harry used to go to . he was passing just after it happened .
his own doctor ?	yes .
yes . they said it was n't the driver 's fault . harry often said what a careful driver he was .	he was harry 's driver ?
... at all .	i know . i wondered about it a hundred times , if it really was an accident .
i do n't know . they did n't answer .	i was told there were only two men there .
you should n't get mixed up in this .	well , if i do find out something , can i look you up again ?
what 's she talking about ?	the police . they 're searching my room . sie mussen doch wissen .
anything really wrong with your papers ?	they 're forged .
why ?	the russians would claim me . i come from czechoslovakia .
oh , what was the name of that doctor ? harry 's doctor ?	dr. winkel .
drink ?	whiskey .
harry ?	yes . he moved his head , but the rest is good , is n't it ?
who are you looking for now ?	sssh . do n't . do n't , please .
the porter is going to talk to us tonight .	need we go through it all again ?
might as well i suppose . are you busy ?	just another part i 've got to learn .
can i hear you ?	in german ?
i can try . is it comedy , or tragedy ?	comedy . i do n't play tragedy .
do i ...	well you read this .
gestern bein heurigen ...	what 's that ?
h-e-z-t ...	oh , let me see . no , no that 's not the cue . it means she has to sit down .
tell me about him .	tell you what ?
when ... what did you do ?	oh , we did n't make much sense . drank too much . once he tried ...
... to steal my girl .	where is she ?
oh , that was many years ago .	tell me more .
... and buried him .	anna .
seemed like a good idea .	it 's just what he used to say .
well , i did n't learn that from him .	if we have to see the porter we 'd better go .
what 's the hurry ? ca n't we talk quietly for a couple of minutes ?	i thought you wanted ...
a moment ago you said you did n't want to see the porter .	we 're both in it , harry .
holly .	i 'm so sorry .
that 's harry 's place , is n't it ?	yes .
let 's go away .	what 's the matter ?
let 's not get into any more trouble .	wait here .
sneak out the other way , and go back to your theatre . i 'd better not see you again .	what are you going to do ?
i wish i knew .	be sensible - tell major calloway .
wer ist da ?	me .
i thought you were going to go away . are n't the police after you ?	i do n't know .
i 'm going back home .	why ?
what happened to your hand ?	a parrot ... let it go .
have you seen calloway ?	can you imagine a parrot nipping a man ?
... you know .	he told you , did n't he ?
he 's better dead . i know he was mixed up - but not like that .	i knew him for twenty years - at least i thought i knew him . i suppose he was laughing at fools like us all the time .
he liked to laugh .	seventy pounds a tube . he wanted me to write for his great medical charity .
... and my lover . he was harry .	well , do n't preach wisdom to me . you talk about him as if he had occasional bad manners .
... again .	there is n't enough for two laughs .
are you going , too ?	oh ...
... is there ?	how did you know i would be here ?
... headquarters .	have you been seeing major calloway again ?
harry .	i 'm sorry .
what is on your mind ? why did you hide ?	hide ? ca n't a fellow have a drink ?
here , it will be cold on that train .	i shall be all right .
what is going to happen ? where is harry ?	he 's safe in the russian zone .
how do you know ?	i saw him today .
did he say anything about me - tell me ?	oh , the usual things ...
of course i did n't tell calloway .	why should he help me like that ? the russians will only make trouble for him .
that 's his headache .	his .
oh , well .	why are you lying ?
... quarrel ?	if you want to sell your service , i 'm not willing to be the price ... i loved him . you loved him . what good have we done him . look at yourself , they have names for faces like that .
... anyway ?	from kurtz . they have just been arrested . but harry wo n't come , he 's not a fool .
good evening , miss schmidt . you remember me ?	of course .
cigarette , miss schmidt ?	thank you .
nichts danke . kein .	entschuldigen sie . it was a terrible thing .
... parents .	yes .
must you take those letters ? calloway yes , i 'm afraid so .	they 're harry 's .
that 's the reason .	you wo n't learn anything from them . they are only love letters . there are not many of them .
they 'll be returned to you , miss schmidt , as soon as they 've been examined .	there 's nothing in them .
right . sit down miss schmidt , we will send your letters and things back to you .	and my passport ?
you know as much as i do , miss schmidt - you were intimate with lime , were n't you ?	we loved each other , do you mean that ?
do you know this man ?	i have never seen him .
joseph harbin ...	no .
he works in a military hospital .	no .
in one of his letters he asked you to telephone - a good friend of his called joseph . he gave you the number of the casanova club . that is where a lot of friends of lime used to go .	it was n't important .
you can help us .	what can i tell you but that you have got everything upside down .
now then , miss schmidt , i 'm not interested in your forged papers - that 's purely a russian case . when did you last see lime ?	two weeks ago .
i want the truth , miss schmidt . we know he is alive .	it 's true then ?
joseph harbin 's body was found in the coffin .	what did you say ? i 'm sorry ...
i said another man was buried in his place .	where 's harry ?
that 's what we want to find out .	i 'm sorry - i do n't seem able to understand anything you say . he 's alive now this minute - he 's doing something .
miss schmidt , we know he is somewhere across the canal in the russian sector ... you may as well help us . in a few minutes colonel brodsky will be questioning you about your papers . tell me where lime is .	i do n't know .
vienna is a closed city , miss schmidt , he ca n't get away .	poor harry , i wish he was dead , he would be safe from all of you then .
must you take those ?	they 'll be returned , miss .
they are - private - letters .	that 's all right , miss , do n't worry . we 're used to it - like doctors .
there you are , miss , your receipt for the letters .	i do n't want it .
here we are . you 'll be all right here , miss .	i do n't ...
thank you , you have been so kind . anna moves down to stand cl of paine .	well , i 'll be saying good night . good night , miss .
yes .	i was a friend of harry lime .
i would very much like to meet you , baron . come around .	austrians are n't allowed in your hotel . could n't we meet at the mozart cafe ?
where ?	just around the corner .
how will i know you ?	i 'll carry a copy of one of your books . harry gave it to me .
what is it ?	this is forgery . it is very clever .
we are interested in this case . have you arrested the girl ?	no , not yet .
please keep this passport to yourself , until i make some inquiries , will you , major ?	yes , of course .
... austrian police headquarters .	can i have that woman 's passport ?
can you tell me whose ...	fellow called lime .
my name is calloway .	martins .
you a friend of lime 's ?	yes .
been here long ?	no .
you 've had a bit of a shock , have n't you ? you could do with a drink .	could you buy me one . i have n't got any austrian kroners . thanks .
back in school . never so lonesome in my life till he showed up .	when did you see him last ?
see much of him before that ?	once in a while .
i 'm afraid i 've never heard of you . what 's your name again ?	holly martins .
did you ever hear of `` the lone rider of santa fe ? ''	i ca n't say that i have .
`` death at the double x ranch '' - ra- a-nch .	no .
must have known i was broke . even sent me an airplane ticket . it 's a shame .	what ?
him dying like that .	best thing that ever happened ...
... to him .	what are you trying to say ?
... policemen . i have to call them sheriffs .	ever seen one ?
... a cop . you 're a real cop i suppose .	it was n't petrol .
why do n't you catch a few murderers for a change ?	well , you could say that murder was part ...
listen , callaghan .	calloway - i 'm english , not irish .
... expense .	going to find me the real criminal ? it sounds like one of your stories .
what the devil ?	getting around , martins .
and there was a third man there . i suppose that does n't sound peculiar to you .	i 'm not interested in whether a racketeer like lime was killed by his friends or by accident . the only important thing is that he 's dead .
tactful too , are n't we , callaghan ?	calloway .
miss schmidt .	you 're not locking her up ?
get the next plane .	as soon as i get to the bottom of this , i 'll get the next plane .
death is at the bottom of everything , martins . leave death to the professionals .	do you mind if i use that line in my next western ? you ca n't chuck me out , my papers are in order .
what do you want to see a doctor for , huh ?	a bruised lip .
a parrot bit me .	oh , stop behaving like a fool , martins .
well ?	in vienna ...
do you see what that means ?	are you too busy chasing a few tubes of penicillin to investigate a murder ?
that is the racket harry lime organized .	calloway , you have n't shown me one shred of evidence .
next , paine .	i would like a word with this orderly harbin .
so would i .	bring him in .
... a week ago .	it 's more like a mortuary than police headquarters .
... be responsible for you in the streets .	i 'm not asking you to .
... in the morning .	thank you . excuse me .
i followed his shadow until suddenly ...	well ? ...
this is where he vanished .	i see .
i suppose you do n't believe me .	no .
look ... i tell you , you do n't think i 'm blind , do you ?	yes . where were you when you saw him first ?
fifty yards right down there .	which side of the road ?
i was on that side , the shadow was on that side , and no turnings on either side .	how about the doorway ?
i tell you i heard him running ahead of me .	yes , yes , yes , and then he vanished out there , i suppose with a puff of smoke and like a clap of ...
it would n't work .	we 'll never get him in the russian zone .
calloway !	oh , there you are . come in here , there is n't much time .
a girl of spirit .	she 's right . it 's none of my business .
did n't i ?	you all did .
do you mind if i drop off somewhere on the way ? i 've got an appointment , wo n't take five minutes ...	of course .
paine lent me one of your books ; `` oklahoma kid , '' i think it was . read a bit of it ... think it 's pretty good . what made you take up this sort of thing ? been doing it for long ?	all right , calloway . you win .
i never knew there were snake charmers in texas ...	i said you win .
win what ?	i 'll be your dumb decoy duck .
what time is it ?	two thirty .
calloway , ca n't you do something about anna ?	i 'll do what i can , if she 'll let me .
wait a minute - let me out .	well , there 's not much time .
be sensible , martins .	i have n't got a sensible name , calloway .
please be careful , sir . up we come . written anything lately ?	take him to sacher 's .
it 's a military hotel .	i 'm so glad to have met you , sir . i 've read quite a few of your books .
write her out a receipt , paine . give her a receipt for these letters too .	this way , miss .
very good , sir .	you know , paine 's one of your devoted readers . he 's promised ...
... of santa fe . ''	i 'd like to visit texas one day , sir .
shall i go over there , sir ?	no , no . leave them for a while .
get me major callaghan on the phone .	oh , mr. martins ...
... excuse me .	please hurry up - just get him on the telephone .
do you know his number ?	no , i do n't know ...
... his number .	i 'll look it up for you .
you do !	yes , cultural re-education section propaganda . very important in a place like this . we do a little show each week . last week we did `` hamlet '' and the week before we had something ...
welcome ?	i 'll tell you what , mr. martins . on wednesday night at our institute , we are having a little lecture on the contemporary novel ... i thought perhaps you 'd like to speak .
they would n't know me .	nonsense . your novels are very popular here . are n't they , sergeant ?
how long can one stay here on this stage money ?	listen , mr. martins , if you 'd agree to be our guest , we 'd be delighted to have you .
come upstairs a moment .	i know a very good dentist .
it was just a soldier . i was trying to punch his major in the eye .	no , a major , were you really ?
heard of harry lime ?	i 've heard of him , of course , but i did n't exactly know him .
i was going to stay with him , but he died thursday .	goodness , that 's awkward .
... this lecture business , you 'll put me up here a while ?	certainly .
seems exciting .	it is , and i 'm gunning just the same way for your major callaghan .
oh , mr. martins , good evening .	good evening mr. crabbin .
hello - mr. martins , we tried to get you at your hotel . we have arranged that lecture for tomorrow .	what about ?

hmm .	she 's been arrested .
what can i do , old man , i 'm dead , are n't i ?	you can help her .
... exactly who did you tell about me ? hmm ?	i told the police .
unwise , holly ...	and - anna ...
did the police believe you ?	you do n't care anything at all about anna , do you ?
well , i 've got quite a lot on my mind .	you would n't do anything .
what do you want me to do ?	you can get somebody else ...
do you expect me to give myself up ?	why not ?
it 's far better thing that i do ... holly , you and i are n't heroes , the world does n't make any heroes ...	you 've got plenty of contacts .
i 'm only safe in the russian zone ... i 'm safe as long as they can use me ...	as long as they can use you ?
you told them , did n't you ?	do n't try to be a policeman , old man .
part ? you can have any part you want , so long as you do n't interfere ... i have never cut you out of anything yet .	i remember when they raided the gambling joint - you know a safe way out ...
have you ever seen any of your victims ?	do you know , i do n't ever feel comfortable on these sort of things ... victims ?
... this way .	what do you want ?
mr. martins . delighted to meet you . come let 's sit down here . ober ! zwei . what would you like . tea ? coffee ?	coffee .
it 's wonderful how you keep the tension .	tension ? kurtz suspense .

... were of you .	what did he say ?
... you know and all that .	but he said he died instantaneously .
well , there was only you , and this friend of his . who is he ?	a roumanian .
... you .	only his doctor , dr. winkel .
not necessarily . she 'd probably want to help .	what 's the good of another post mortem ? suppose you dig up something - well - discreditable to harry ?
... your address ?	i live in the russian sector , but you 'll find me at the casanova club every night . one has to work ...
... the best way one can , you know .	what 's the name of this girl ?

could he have been conscious ?	conscious ? cas soll ich auch noch wissen ?
oh , er - oh ... was he - was he still alive ?	er , alive ? he could n't have been alive , not with his head in the way it was .

fer von mir aus gehen sie zur gansalt aber mich lassen sie aus mit der politzei .	now , hold on .
i have no evidence . i saw nothing . i said nothing . it 's not my business .	well make it your business .

harry ...	two double whiskeys . was wunschen sie ?
i thought there was something funny about the whole thing .	funny ?
something wrong .	of course there was . some ice for mr. martins .
that 's all you meant ?	what else ?
was n't he at the police inquiry ?	he did n't want to get involved .
what else did he tell you ?	that harry was dead before you got him to that statue .

should i make it all fact ?	why no , mr. martins .

yea , ok. i will be , i will be , i promise .	thanks .
what are you doing in thailand ? tourist ?	traveler .
you go to patpong ? see smoke from pussy , ping pong ball from pussy , razor blade from pussy ; bird from pussy .	i do n't think so .

bonjour .	good morning .
the noise ? do n't worry . you 're on holiday .	she means your neighbor . the scotsman
oh , that noise ! yes , he certainly did .	we moved rooms because of him .
it would be nice though , if there was a place like that . you know , that no one could get to .	of course , but look ; all these people . if that place existed , they 'd all be there .
it 's arranged . tomorrow morning . eight hundred bath .	nice work .
he will not take us to the island . it 's in the national park and it is forbidden to go there . but we are allowed to travel to this one to stay for one night .	that 's the wrong one .
yes , of course i can swim . how far do you think it is ?	one or two kilometers .
oh . great . not far at all . i do n't like to be negative , but do you think we should let someone know where we 're going ?	why ?
richard , it 's secret . that 's the whole point .	yeah , ok. forget it . we wo n't tell anyone .

a shark fin ?	i do n't know , just a fin . over there . about a hundred meters .
big ?	yes .
well what the fuck do you expect me to do about it .	nothing . i just thought you ought to know .

she is gone !	what happened ?
she just went under the water . she was pulled under . oh god , i do n't see her .	was there a shark ? did you see a shark ?
what about moliere ?	fuck off .
he tried to borrow money from us .	what idiot would lend him money ? it would disappear .
he said if we lent him money h would tell us about a secret beach .	it 's on an island that no one get to .
but he has been there , off course .	it was ridiculous ; all this at three o'clock in the morning .
we leave our rucksacks on this island and then we swim .	you can swim ?
one kilometer	two .
bonsoir .	eh - bonsoir .
did you sleep well ?	not too bad .
hi .	hi there . here , take a look .
so from there to there ?	we swim .
have you told someone ?	no .
francoise -	sshh . etienne will be angry if i wake him . he thinks i waste film taking photographs of the sky .
i think so too .	one night i will get the perfect photograph .
you realize that in the eternity of space , there is a planet , just like this one , where you are photographing back towards us . you 're photographing yourself .	incredible .
there are infinite worlds out there , where anything that can happen does happen .	so on one you are rich , on another poor . on one you are a murderer , on another the victim .
exactly .	richard , you know something -
that is just the kind of pretentious bullshit that englishmen and americans always say to french girls so that they can sleep with them .	sorry . i thought i was doing quite well .
too far ?	if it 's too far , then we 'll drown . but if we dont try then we 'll never know .
we lost our key .	where did you lose it ?
do you know the kentucky friend mouse story ? ''	woman bites chicken leg , turns out to be a mouse . or a rat . it 's an urban myth .
exactly . always happened to someone else .	so ?
so there 's an urban myth , well more of a rural myth , going around here at the moment . it 's about a beach .	uh-huh .
but , danny , if hashem is everything , and we are nothing how are we to judge his actions ?	we have free will and intelligence -- which god allegedly gave us ... .
you think ? ! based on what ?	there 's midrash supporting this . my father read a book by shalom spiegel that -- isaac actually died and was reborn .
no one follows that midrash .	i do ; i follow it . but okay , say god provided the ram . so what ? once abraham raised the knife , in his heart it was as if he 'd killed him . he could never forget that . and neither could isaac . look at him : he 's traumatized , he 's a putz for the rest of his life . by the end he ca n't tell jacob from esau ... .
watch your language ... .	i think the whole jewish people were permanently scarred by what happened on mt . moriah , and we still live in terror ... .
and you , if you had come out of egypt , you would have been destroyed in the desert with those who worshipped the golden calf .	then let him destroy me now . let him crush me like the conceited bully he is . go ahead . kill me . here i am . do it ! !
they only kill them when they love them ?	what are you doing here , i thought you were a nazi .
what 's a fascist ?	i rest my case . he 's a jewish nazi . he always was .
whereas avi 's a zionist nazi .	the zionists are n't nazis .
they 're racist , they 're militaristic , they act like bullyboys in the territories ... .	they do n't have extermination camps .
read the early zionists on european jewry ; they sound like goebbels .	they sound like you .
... so she takes the pants in back -- where they try them on ? and i think fuck it ... .	are you shitting me ? ? right in the store ?
fucking danny , man ...	he 's an asshole .
did n't you see < i > raiders of the lost ark < /i > ?	what ? ?
that was an ark , man . that was a torah . they fucked around with it , and the torah melted their faces .	that 's a movie , you moron .
what do you think you 're doing ?	who the fuck are you ?
bring your friends ... . we 're not his friends .	then i wo n't bring you ... .
what , do you like it here ?	read < i > mein kampf < /i > ? hitler had all his best ideas in prison .
you coming ?	we 'll go to the country sometime , okay ?
do we have to listen to this shit ?	yes .
oh , please ...	danny , it 's true . there were no six million . at most , two hundred thousand jews died in the camps . and the majority of them were from disease and --
where did you read this ? robert faurisson ?	yeah . he 's a respected scholar . even no-am chomsky says he --
what do you care ?	i do n't , but ...
it 's called the flame alphabet . it 's supposed to be the word of god written in fire .	fire ...
how come you know all this shit ?	how come you do n't know it ? how can you say you hate the jews when you do n't know anything about --
fuck you . i hate the jews at least as much as you do .	no , you do n't ... . if you hated them , you 'd study them , so you 'd know why you hate them . you know what tefillin is ? tsitsis ? shotness ? you know the kaddish from the kiddush ? eichmann ? he went to israel . he studied the torah , the talmud , the mishnah , the whole bit . he hated jews .
yeah , but not on the letters .	why the fuck not ?
you write that ? come work for me . you 've got a lot to learn ; i can teach it to you .	i have a job .
this ? this is a joke . i 'll give your group a thousand bucks .	you gave fifty thousand to that college magazine .
fifty 's an exaggeration . anyway , that was a different moment . things were possible that are n't now .	actually , i think this moment has possibilities that --
forget the jewish stuff . it does n't play anymore . there 's only the market , now , and it does n't care who you are .	people still need values , beliefs ... .
no , they do n't . not the smart ones . look , i 'll give you five grand if you can document your tax-exempt status ... . but when you fall off this horse , come see me . i can show you how to make a lot of money .	i do n't care about money .
you will .	you 're a jew . maybe you do n't realize it , but you are .
have you read toynbee ? spengler ?	nobody reads that stuff anymore .
too difficult ?	too christian . you know jameson ? paul virilio ?
the point is , the modern world is a jewish disease .	disease ? what disease ?
which is what ?	at first , no one will know why the victims are being killed .
you 're not in school ? what do you do ?	i work at the big boy warehouse . in queens . i drive a fork-lift .
where 'd you read all that stuff ?	i just read it ... .
why no silencer ?	you want it to be an event .
`` ... < i > und die worte zerfielen mir im munde wie modrige pilze < /i > ... ''	`` and the words fell apart in my mouth like moldering mushrooms ... ''
how come so many of the books are in spanish ?	they 're my father 's . he 's from argentina . my mother 's family went there during the war . that 's where they met .
are they still together ?	he 's in a mental institution ... . he 's been there for ten years , off and on . mostly on .
is he a nazi ?	i guess . his parents are . he does n't care about that .
what 's he care about ?	killing himself .
you think people ever commit suicide out of happiness ?	that 's stupid . why would they ?
you 're not like the others , are you ? ... your friends .	yes , i am . basically i am .
i bet . he did n't realize that nobody who talks such a good game ever plays one .	you were n't complaining about my play last time .
too many good players down here . i 'm with one right now .	oh , really ?
bigger and better .	then how come you 're talking to me ?
who 's linda ?	why wo n't you talk to me ?
when can i see you ?	you ca n't .
your father ? ?	he 's at a home out here .
i 'm coming to your room tonight .	no .
where 'd you get this ?	i stole it . from a synagogue .
how come there 's no punctuation ?	that was a later invention , it 's not in the scrolls ... . anyway , the jews know where the sentences end . they know the whole thing by heart . every word . every letter .
do you know it like that ? by heart .	no .
but you can read it , the hebrew ... . right ?	what do you care ?
va-yomer ... and he said . it goes the other way .	oh , yeah ...
va-yomer adonai el avram : lech lecha mayartzcha oo-mimohlad-tcha oo-m'bayt avaycha el ha-ertez asher arecha ...	what 's it mean ?
i want to learn to read it .	why ?
know your enemy ... . 'cause it 's a basic text of western culture . i want to read it in the original . okay ?	hebrew 's very difficult . it would take years .
put something on . you 're not supposed to be naked in front of it .	why not ?
they think it 's the word of god , and it 's holy , and the flesh is n't ... .	that 's stupid .
see , the jews love to separate things : the holy from the profane , milk from meat , wool from linen , the sabbath from the week , the jew from the gentile ... . as if one little scrap of this was going to completely contaminate that .	what assholes .
who gets contaminated , the jews or the gentiles ?	good question . both . aleph ...
it looks a little like a swastika .	it 's silent . it holds a place , takes a vowel . the vowels are little dots that go under the letters .
where are they ?	they do n't put them in the torah . i 'll get you a chumash , they 'll have them there ... bet ... gimel ... dalid ... hay ... how come you 're here instead of with curtis ? besides the hebrew lessons ...
the sex is better .	even though his dick is so big ?
with you there 's a tragic dimension .	vuv ... zayin ... chet ... tet ...
payn tash-chiton v'ashiytem ...	v'asitem ...
v'asitem lechem pessel to-monat . and make no graven image of the lord , or the form of any figure , or of man or woman , or beast or fowl or fish or anything that looks like anything . because he 's not like anything . not only ca n't you see him or hear him , you ca n't even think about him . i mean , what 's the difference between that and him not existing ?	no difference .
christianity 's silly , but at least there 's something to believe in . or not believe . judaism there 's nothing .	nothing but nothingness ... judaism 's not about belief .
what 's it about ?	about doing things . you light candles , say prayers , keep the sabbath , visit the sick ... .
and belief follows ?	no . nothing follows . you do n't do it because it 's smart or stupid or it saves your soul . you 're not saved . nobody 's saved . you do it because the torah tells you do . you submit to the torah .
fuck that .	do n't curse in front of it .
why should i submit ?	you should n't .
no , i think you should n't .	judaism does n't even need god . you have the torah , the law . that 's your fucking god ... . the book 's closed .
you 're learning the hebrew really fast .	i told you , i 'm good at this .
plus you have nothing else to do all day .	oh , am i learning it faster than you did ? maybe i 'm smarter .
what ... ? you think i 'm jewish ?	it 's all you talk about . jewish , jewish , jewish . nobody talks about it that much except the jews .
nazis talk about it all the time .	do they ?
the real nazis . hitler , goebbels , they talked about jews incessantly ... . you ever read their diaries ? ...	is that why you became a nazi ? so you could talk about jews incessantly ?
believe me , adolf hitler could n't possibly have hated the jews as much as i do . not in a billion years . you know why ?	'cause he was n't a rabbi .
you want a punch in the mouth ?	okay ... why do n't we light candles on friday ? let 's light candles ... . and say the kaddish .
kaddish is the prayer for the dead .	i mean kiddush . let 's say kiddush . and shave my head , fuck through a sheet , all that stuff ... come on , just for fun . to see what it 's like ...
you ca n't . do you know how many people i 've brought into ... the movement ... ?	lina , come here !
come on , we can be like eichmann . he studied torah . he hated jews .	is it like eichmann ? are we goofing ?
i do n't know . i just want to try it .	shit ... did you talk to your mother today ?
no . what are you looking for ?	nothing . why are you doing this ? i thought god did n't exist .
he commands it whether he exists or not ... look , we can fight him and be crushed . or we can submit .	and be crushed .
look , just light the candles with me . then we 'll eat . you have to eat .	you eat first , then you light . once you light , it 's yom kippur , which means you 're fasting , so you ca n't ... eat .
miriam called , looking for you . she said you might come , so i ...	you got ta get out of here .
carla ? ... it 's me , danny ... danny balint ... ? we met at that ... [ meeting at your house . ]	yeah , i remember ... . kill any jews yet ?
i did n't realize you cared .	i do n't . i was just curious how full of shit you were .
did you know that there was a < i > new york times < /i > reporter there that night ?	really , which one ? i bet it was the guy with the prada shoes .
i did n't notice his shoes ... . did your mother know he was there ?	i doubt it . how did you find out ?
that 's a much easier game .	why do n't you come visit , we 'll have a rematch .
i thought there were people here ... .	i 'll go look ... .
who 's eichmann ?	who 's eichmann ? ! ! ?
shema yisrael adonai elohenu adonai echod .	what 'd you say ?
why are you taking that ?	i 'm stealing it .
... i thought we agreed , no anti- semitism ... it 's exactly what we 're trying to put behind us ... . trash the blacks , fine ; but ...	did you see how they reacted to him ?
yes , of course . but that only plays in this room , with people who are n't embarrassed to call themselves nazis . if you want a modern fascism , you do n't mention jews .	it 's a romantic movement , curtis . it always has been .
an investment banking house .	he 's jewish ? manzetti ?
danny , the night we met , you said the name ilio manzetti . we were impressed . we were excited . but here it is september , and mr. manzetti is still walking around breathing the air .	we need intellectuals , we have enough thugs already .
more cultural than political .	obviously .
that would be a catastrophic mistake .	people hate jews . do you agree ?
they used to . today it 's not an issue .	no , but deep down , beneath the `` tolerance '' they learn on television , nothing 's changed . the very word makes their skin crawl . it is n't even hate , really . it 's more the way we feel when a rat runs across the floor . we want to step on it . crush it . we do n't even know why . it 's a physical reaction . everyone feels it .
you would n't announce it ?	i 'd say nothing . after two or three , people will try to find a pattern . a reason .
but when it comes out , the public will be outraged . it will look like germany all over again .	is n't that what we want ? germany all over again ? only done right this time ...
totally . the family emigrated from bulgaria when he was eleven .	how would you kill him ?
... insulting people who were in the camps . ... what 's the point ?	they 're liars and cowards .
i 'm sure they are . but what do we accomplish by pointing it out ?	it 's the truth ... .
leo strauss ... i 've got to go to boston . i came to say goodbye .	what about mrs. moebius and ... ?
they left an hour ago . you mind some personal advice ? forget carla . that 's not the side your bread 's buttered on . how soon can you get back to the city ?	a week or so . there 's something i want to do here first .
we want to build bridges to certain positions in the political mainstream : works like < i > the bell curve < /i > , < i > sociobiology < /i > , anti-zionism , anti- immigration , the com-munitarian issue ... . we 'll hold conferences : invite liberals , blacks , jews . chomsky , cockburn , stanley crouch , shahack ... .	i 've been waiting all my life for something like this .
what about ... manzetti , the synagogues ... .	that does n't seem to be happening , does it ?
is it okay if i record this ?	no ... yeah , fine , go ahead ... so what 's this about ? is this about me ?
i 'm trying to figure out where the radical right is going to next ... .i thought you were the most interesting person at that meeting .	what about curtis zampf ?
curtis is a politician -- and a bit of a hustler . he 's not a thinker .	i agree .
the other night you said the modern world is a jewish disease . could you elaborate on that ?	in the movement -- the racialist movement -- we believe there 's a hierarchy of the races . not just in iq , but in the civilization , the art , the forms of government , the civilizations that each race produces ... why are you writing this down if you 're recording it ?
it helps me concentrate ... . so does that mean you 're a white supremacist ?	what should i be , a white inferior- ist ? a multicultural zulu egalitarian ? let me ask , where are your people from ?
my mother 's family is french , my father 's was german , originally .	german . mine , too . so who do you think 's given more to the world , the germans -- beethoven , goethe , nietzsche -- or the entire continent of africa ? ibos , bantus , mandingos ...
the jews are different ... . blacks are disgusting and inferior , but it 's like criticizing a retarded child . the jews are ... a poison in the human well ... .	a poison ... ?
let me give you an example ... . sexuality .	sexuality ? ? ? what do you mean ?
you ever fuck a jewish girl ?	what ? ? ! ?
did you ever fuck one , guy ?	what 's that go to do with ... i 've gone out with a , with jewish women . why ?
and ? what did you notice ?	notice ? like what ... ?
jewish girls like to give head , right ?	i do n't know . is that right ?
and jewish men like to get it .	everybody likes to , do n't they ?
yes . it 's very pleasurable . but the jews are obsessed with it . you know why ?	why ?
because the jew is essentially female .	female ...
real men -- white , christian men -- we fuck a woman . we make her come with our cocks . but the jew does n't like to penetrate and thrust -- he ca n't assert himself that directly -- so he resorts to perversions . oral sex is technically a perversion , you know that , do n't you ? after a woman has been with a jewish man , she never wants a normal partner again . a normal man .	does that mean the jew is the better lover ?
you 're not listening . he is n't better . he gives pleasure , but that 's actually a weakness .	danny , what makes you think you know all this ?
let 's just say i 've done due diligence .	so , fine , it 's not that the jew , the jews own the media and the banks . it 's that they 're sexually corrupt .
deracinate ... tear out the roots . a people -- a real people -- derives its genius from the land : the sun , the sea , the soil . this is how they know themselves . but the jew does n't have soil .	he has israel .
those are n't jews .	of course they 're jews .
notice the israelis : a fundamentally secular society . they no longer need judaism because they have soil . the real jew is a wanderer , a nomad . he has no roots , no attachments . so he `` universalizes '' everything . he ca n't hammer a nail , plow a field . he can only buy and sell , invest capital , manipulate markets . he takes the life of a people rooted in soil and turns it into a cosmopolitan culture based on books , ideas , numbers . this is his strength ... . take the great jewish minds : marx , freud , einstein . what have they given us : communism , infantile sexuality and the atom bomb . in a mere three centuries since these guys emerged from the ghettos of europe , they 've taken us from a world built on order and reason and hurled us into a chaos of class warfare , irrational urges and relativity , a world where the very existence of matter and meaning is in doubt . why ? because it is the deepest impulse of the jewish soul to unravel the very fabric of life until nothing is left but thread , nothing but nothingness . nothingness without end ...	are all jews the same ?
what ? excuse me ? ... you 're kidding , right ?	do you know rabbi stanley nadelman ? he used to be at congregation beth elohim in ozone park ... ?
who ? how would i know him ?	he says you were bar mitzvahed there , in march 1988 .
you believe that ? and you call yourself a reporter ?	so you 're saying it 's not true .
were you ever bar mitzvahed anywhere else ?	do you know who you 're fucking with here ?
that 's what i 'm trying to find out , danny . who am i fucking with here ?	listen to me ... .
why would nadelman lie ?	to discredit me . because i know who they are . look , i thought i explained it to you . those people can say or do anything . and they will . it 's all narrative to them , it 's ... are you going to print what this guy said ?
give me a reason not to .	it 's slander . it 's reckless disregard . i 'll sue you and your fucking jew paper .
but if the jews are strengthened by hate , would n't this `` destruction '' you speak of -- by love or by any other means -- in fact make them more powerful than they are already ?	yes . infinitely more . they would become as god .
did you kill ilio manzetti ?	no .
two days ago you addressed a nazi rally . last week you went to a torah study group .	what were you , following me ?
how do you reconcile the two ?	i do n't . look , stay out of what you do n't understand .
explain it so i can .	you work for the < i > new york times < /i > . your whole job in life is not to understand things like me .
i do n't think you know what you are .	yeah , and what are you ? a < i > times < /i > man ? a presbyterian ? impotent ? a prick ?
who killed manzetti ?	if i tell you , will you pull the story ? not write about me ?
it 's too late ... . if i did n't , somebody else would . yom kippur starts at sundown . will you go to synagogue ?	get the fuck away from me .
i always won .	the arguments , anyway .
why did you come tonight ? to see me ?	to hear them read torah .
i thought you hated torah .	that does n't mean i do n't like hearing it .
you know the joke : a jew 's shipwrecked on a desert island . when they rescue him , they see he 's built two synagogues . they say , for vhat do you need two synagogues ? he says , vun to pray in , and vun i 'd never set foot in so long as i live , so help me god . you pray in the one you 'd never set foot in ... and vice versa .	i ca n't help what i think .
tell me about lina moebius .	how did you ... ?
i work in the da 's office . you go to those meetings , half the people there are informants .	you mean the < i > times < /i > guy ?
which < i > times < /i > guy ?	with the shoes ... there was more than one ?
you 're telling me you killed him ? you ? killed him ? bullshit . what kind of gun did you use ?	a forty-five .
it was a nine millimeter .	you 're lying .
so are you ... but they 'll believe you ... . lina moebius is saying the whole thing was your idea . that you proposed it in a meeting at her house . ah , jesus , danny ... what were you thinking ? are you glad manzetti 's dead ? do you really want to kill jews ? you want to kill me ?	i was just talking . i -- look , i ca n't help what i think .
all right , what if all along you were actually infiltrating the nazis -- to expose them ... .	but i was n't .
and only talked about killing manzetti to convince them you were an anti-semite . if you 'd had any idea somebody would take it seriously , you never would have said it .	i ca n't say that .
think about your father . your sister .	the truth does n't mean anything to you , does it ?
danny , i 'm trying to -- save you .	fucking kike .
you shut up . who do you think you are ?	there 's a bomb here . it 's going to go off at seven-thirty .
how did you get the fucking number ?	i want you to say kaddish for her . it 's the only thing she asked from us ... .
i do n't do that .	you do it on the inside ... .
do n't tell me what i --	... i want you to do it on the outside , too .
no !	yes !
lina moebius . and you are ... ?	daniel balint .
balint ?	it 's german .
what part of germany are you people from ?	from the rhineland originally .
are you with the fbi , mr . balint ? ... or any other law enforcement agency ?	i was going to ask you the same thing .
without blood -- a willingness to spill it -- there 's no real power , no authority .	curtis is afraid you 'll marginalize us .
we 're already marginal . we are saying what no one else has the guts to say . is n't that precisely our appeal ?	so what jew would you kill first ?
do you feel you 're making progress here ?	you mean ilio manzetti ?
how have things been going ?	fine .
hello ... ?	lina ... it 's happening . tonight .
what is happening ?	beth shalom . like you wanted .
beth shalom ? what are you talking about ? who is this ... ?	lina , you said if i was going to plant a bomb , i should --
what about chicken ?	that 's meat .
the bible only says do n't seethe a kid in its mother 's milk . but chickens do n't give milk .	look , you want cheese , go someplace else .
but it 's stupid , right ? you admit it 's stupid .	no , i do n't admit it 's stupid .
you can have chicken with eggs but not with milk . why is that ?	i 'm not here to talk about religious law , if you do n't like --
but you already talked about it : you said it 's not stupid . why is n't it stupid ?	steve ...
what are you doing here ?	i just came to get some stuff . i 'll be out in five minutes . he does n't want me around .
he 's going to die . he wo n't take his medicine . he eats dairy . he probably still smokes when i 'm not around . i asked him to come live with us . alex offered to share his room , unsolicited ... . but he did n't want to be any trouble .	then he could n't be bitter about living alone .
ah , jesus christ , danny , how can you wear that thing ? ... you know what it means ? to your people ...	they 're not my people ... .
tell it to hitler .	oh , he decides ? hitler 's the chief rabbi now ? ...
is this because of those kids who used to beat you up ?	what kids ? ...
the polacks ? from sacred heart ?	nobody ever beat me up . look , linda , there 're fifty reasons . even if you knew them all , there 'd be another fifty you did n't know .
do you know them ? i made him some noodles for dinner . you can heat them up and --	i 've got to get back to the --
hello ... ?	daniel balint ? my name 's guy danielsen . i 'm a reporter with the < i > new york times < /i > .
i 'm doing a piece on right-wing groups , post oklahoma city . i hear you 're an important figure in those circles . you have a lot of interesting ideas ... .	who told you that ?
is n't it true ?	no , it 's ... yeah , it 's true , but ... how 'd you get this number ? ... no , not here ... maybe sunday ? there 's a place off queens blvd . near the courthouse ...
who knows what that is ?	a jewish prayer .
which was his room ?	number ten .
where 's mrs. moebius ?	her place is down the road . but she just comes out for weekends sometimes .
that was unbelievable what you did to lucas . the guy 's an animal .	you could do it .
get out of here ... .	you look right through him . he 's there , but there 's something on the other side of him that you want . it 's all you want . and whatever 's in the way does n't matter ... . then it 's easy .
which one were you aiming at ?	the mother .
what is it ?	green dot -- shotgun powder . for pipe bombs . a guy in a lumberyard gave it to me . a donation to the cause .
shut up . fuck you ... .	what ... ?
open it up .	here ...
this will be a different kind of device .	that damn thing . you know how it made me look ... ?
i 'm sorry , danny . it wo n't happen again . i 'm going to use a brand-new power cell . plus we 'll have a back-up timer .	i 've got ta kill some jews , kyle . i 'm serious . i 'm always talking about it . this time it 's got ta happen .
what about drake , did he ever show up ?	no , it 's weird , man . nobody knows where he went .
that 's all we 've got left .	it 'll be enough if we use it right . okay , the service 'll go about another hour . say an hour for the janitors , then one more just to be safe ... we 'll go in at midnight .
did n't you get anything ?	i 'm not hungry ... . come on , let 's drive around ... . we do n't want to be spotted here .
oh , what is this shit ?	keep driving . do n't slow down .
not too fast .	you said they did n't have night guards .
they do n't . i checked twenty times ... . somebody must have talked .	who even knew ?
mrs. moebius .	why ? why would she ?
the manzetti thing must have scared her . she thinks she 'll get implicated .	so what do we do with the device ?
take a right on 59th ... we 'll put it someplace else .	where ?
if i went back to the lumberyard , the guy 'd give me all the dynamite i wanted . untraceable , you would n't -- need to ...	no , it has to be tomorrow . you wo n't get this many of them in here for another year . it 'll be fine .
it 's not going to be fine . it 's --	just do it .
when do you want it to go off ?	seven-thirty tomorrow evening .
jeez , it 's been since , what , kenny 's wedding .	yeah , uh ... so how are you ? what 's going on ?
i 'm in the rabbinic program at jts ...	jts ... ?
what about you ? what are you doing ? something strange , i bet .	i 'm in a kind of ... underground ... thing .
are you an artist ?	no , no ... not that kind of ... underground . more a private ... business . private .
you remember miriam ... .	yeah , hey , how 're you doing ...
she 's at yale law -- interning with the district attorney ... we 're getting married next spring . in israel .	wow , that 's uh ... great ...
listen , danny , you ca n't just barge in and --	shut up ...
danny , listen , people expect me to daven ; they do n't want someone they do n't know -- leading their prayers .	get out of my way .
lie on your stomach and come up on your elbows .	why me ?
who 'd you kill ?	four . but no one this important .
how did you know they were jews ?	i can tell ... .
how ?	i was a jew in a previous life .
shoot him in the head . always shoot a jew in the head .	i 'm a bad shot . i do n't think i can --
you missed on purpose .	i did n't . i told you , i ca n't --
and what did you do ?	what are you trying to say ?
you ca n't say that ... .	the nazi 's killing his kid . he could 've jumped the guy . he could 've gouged his eyes out , grabbed the bayonet and gutted him ... . what would you have done if they were killing your son ?
so they shot him ! so he was dead . so what . he 's worse than dead now . he 's a piece of shit ...	okay , that 's it . you 're going back to --
where do you think you 're going ?	... we have nothing to learn from these people . they should learn from us .
it 's friday ... .	do i give a shit ?
the torah says not to light a fire on the sabbath , because it 's work , correct ? but if alternating current 's running through the wires every second of every day , and i throw a switch , send it here instead of there , how is that lighting a fire ?	`` do chickens give milk ? ''
who 's this ?	dennis leary .
leary ?	no .
howard stern .	obviously .
adam sandler .	funny ?
not like mr. dorfmann .	he was funny .
after your mother died , that 's when you stopped going to shul . doing your homework . everything .	and that 's when the mets started to stink .
'cause they got rid of johnson . he knew how to deal with the assholes . dallas green , please ...	valentine ...
there 's some maple walnut in the freezer .	linda says you 're not supposed to have dairy .
we want you to help run it . give speeches , lead seminars ... handle the fund-raising .	fund-raising ? ?
i 'm not an intellectual ... . i mean , i read , but ... fund-raising is n't what i ...	look , if you want to kill jews on your free time , fine . we need you to raise money . will you do that for us ?
do you have a suit ? let 's get him one ... . and a cell phone too . and if you insist on blowing up a synagogue , make it that big one on fifth avenue , would you ?	beth shalom ? it 's reform .
so what ?	they 're not that jewish .
we tested the new bomb .	what ?
we redesigned the timing mechanism . it ca n't possibly malfunction .	danny , please . just give your speech ... . and nothing about jews , okay ?
are you out of your mind ? !	i was just trying to make a point . if --
do you think i ...	danny , please , we do n't want to know .
may he cause the light of his countenance to shine upon you and be gracious unto you ... .	eat shit ... .
... may you be blessed in your going forth as you were in your coming ... .	eat shit , assholes ... .
oh , fuck you ...	as you know , cindy , thirteen is a mystical number in the jewish faith . we believe that god has thirteen attributes ...
... you 're saying that when he first appeared at your house , you had no idea he was jewish ... .	none whatsoever . but i have to admit , i 'm not terribly surprised .
what do you mean ?	i think anti-semitism today is largely a jewish phenomenon . would n't you agree ?
in the third reich , were n't a number of high-ranking nazis of jewish origin ?	yes , and they were said to be the most virulent proponents of the final solution . really , who but a jew would want to kill ilio manzetti simply because he was jewish ? who thinks about such things ?
the papers are going to report tomorrow that your colleague , curtis zampf , has been a federal informant for the past two years . do you believe that ?	curtis is always more complicated than he seems . even now .
you 're going to live here permanently ?	... maybe , if jacques will let me fix up the place a little .
he 's shy , not like enzo .	yes . not like enzo .
i think , he 's really nice ... he 's a funny guy ... sometimes even very moving .	... i 'm pregnant , bonita !
are you going to keep it ?	yes .
does he know ?	no .
maybe you should talk to him about it .	i ca n't ... i just do n't know how to ...
i was thinking of something kinda stupid last night . you know those women in the greek mythology that made love with the gods . take leda for example , sleeping with jupiter , who came to earth as a swan ... well , can you imagine leda announcing to her swan `` you 're going to be a father , my little chick-a-dee '' ?	but your man is n't quite a god !
probably not , but i still do n't have the nerve to tell him .	well , you 're going to have to tell him , sometime !
and you ... ? do you love enzo ?	very much , i think . but , there 's going to be a problem .
you 're leaving ?	yes ... could you please give this to enzo .
bonita , you should n't be discouraged so easily .	i do n't have the strength to fight off la mamma ... anyway who wants to spend their whole life waiting at the end of a pier .
did you tell him ?	not yet ... i 'm waiting for the right moment .
this is good work ... unfortunately it 's incomplete . could you eat a sandwich 40 floors above the street .	what kind ?
johana , am i boring you ?	sorry . of course not , definitely not ... well , maybe a little . what did you say ?
did the driver really freeze ?	like a popsicle . they 're keeping him on a stick until spring .
my god ! i 'm glad i did n't go .	... so am i .
listen , i just found out we 've got real problems in sicily !	what d'you mean ?
what 's happened ? ?	the documents are forged .
no !	yes ! the notary is a phony . he has the same signature as the contractor !
it ca n't be true !	we have to send somebody over there immediately ! if we prove the forgery we can cancel the policy . we 'll be off the hook . there 's a flight to rome in two hours and from there its just a short hop to sicily .
i 'll send cardoza , he 'll be able to ...	i tried him , he ca n't go . his son is being bar mitzvohed tomorrow ... i 'll go , boss .
i thought it was spanish that you spoke ?	italian is practically the same thing .
good afternoon .	i came to make a clean breast of everything ... the whole business .
yes . of course . very wise .	remember when i went to italy and canceled the policy on the new stadium . well , we were n't being cheated by the mafia or anybody except maybe by me ... ... do they come for lunch everyday ? i really went on my own business , to see a man that i happen to be in love with ... and i 'm glad i did it , but i 'm sorry about the policy and i 'll be happy to make up the money the company did n't get ... of course just now i do n't have ... one million , four hundred and ten thousand dollars . but if you were to dock my salary , say , twenty dollars a week , in a few hundred years we 'd be even ... and i think this is where you fire me ?
you 're right . you 're fired .	will that interfere with my getting maternity leave ? i 'm pregnant .
the italian , i presume ?	no . he 's french , he was just in italy for the competition .
he seems to have won it .	yes , is n't it wonderful ? i 'm so happy . i 'll bet i 'm the happiest pregnant fired person in the world !
i tell you she 's mine !	hello !
you know each other ?	yes .
this is a great pleasure .	johana cross , pleased to meet you . well ! is n't this a coincidence . i really was n't expecting this ... all the way out here . it 's incredible !
i wish , but it 's full . they recommended a pension in town . they say that all of taormina is full . what 's going on here ?	it 's the free diving world championship . i am by the way world champion !
a spaghetti del mare for the super dedicated traveling insurance agent .	i think i 'll have a coffee .
where did you two meet ?	in a lake .
i might have known . as i was telling you earlier , i 'm the world champion free diver .	congratulations .
a new world record ! that 's great ! it gives me something to beat tomorrow ! you ever been to tahiti ?	no .
you forgot the hula !	yes , of course , i 'll do the hula !
he looks strange , does n't he ? like a baby that just learned to walk .	have you known him long ?
forever . we used to live on the same island in greece , when we were kids .	what was he like , when he was little ?
little . very little . and skinny , very skinny too . that is compared to me .	i get it , enzo you were a superior child .
and just where are you from ?	italy !
huh ? well listen to him ! do you hear that ?	no .
he looks me in the eye like some fuckin ' gold fish , and says : `` i 'm going to beat you '' .	... that 's what he 's here for , is n't he ?
tonight we 're having a little party among ourselves . 8 o'clock in my suite ?	okay .
... it 's easy . you go down . you come up . ... right , johana ?	congratulations , enzo .
and the lights ! running lights , stealing stretchers ... ! you 'll have us in jail .	enzo , stop bitching , will you ?
well , good night , then ...	you going to sleep here , all by yourself ?
... it 's a comfortable place .	sinister is what i 'd call it ... ! ours is so much cheerful ! why do n't you come and stay with me ... there 's plenty of room in my suite .
the mamma 's there too .	yes , the mamma is is there .
is it a poem ?	no , it 's the recipe for spaghetti `` frutti del mare '' . you see i was right in getting you out here . you 're a world champion , my friend !
jacques ! johana !	enzo !
okay , now we have a good five minutes to have a nice peaceful talk .	what are you doing here ?
checking out the competition .	enzo , why do you guys do this ?
what else is there ?	you know what i 'm talking about .
you risk your life when you cross the street .	damn it ! why wo n't you give me a straight answer , for once ? !
because you 'd laugh .	i wo n't , i swear .
a little ... you think it 's the same for jacques ?	no . jacques is a creature of the sea . he is n't meant to live on earth , among us ... you should know this , johana .
he can learn . he is learning .	you really think so ? did you tell him you were pregnant ?
how do you know that ?	you told bonita , but you did n't tell him , right ?
... not yet .	do n't .
why ?	because he wo n't understand and it will just hurt you ... jacques has been put on earth by complete mistake . and he 's only waiting for one thing : that some god up there will turn him into a fish ! how long has that moron been down there ?
five minutes and fifty seconds .	that idiot !
is he alright ? what happened ?	the fool was asleep ! if i were n't around , he 'd already be dead ! ! ! is that who you want to live with ?
how did it happen ?	the company asked me to extract everything i could from the wreck ; so the divers were trying to get at the engine ... and then the boat turned over ... in the current ... and ... look , i fucked up ! can you help ?
ten thousand .	lira ?
dollars .	you 're going to hold me up at a time like this ?
in my village , we have a saying : when the wind blows , the flags of all nations flap in the same direction .	what does that mean ?
roberto ? how long ?	six seconds .
enzo , what are you going to do with the money ?	have the car painted .
santini will do that for 25 dollars !	then tell him to wax it too .
enzo , really . what are you going to get ?	a rosary for mama , a dress for
yes ?	find the frenchman . find me mayol .
what about the shoes ?	very chic . anyway , you do n't have anything else , do you ?
enzo , wake up !	eh ? si ! avanti !
the medics are looking all over for you .	i 'm meditating , ca n't you see ? jacques does two hours of yoga before going down . i can take a five minute nap , ca n't i ?
where did you get that ?	`` that '' ! this is not a `` that '' ...
is he here ?	he 's training .
plenty of women everywhere right ?	smoking is absolutely forbidden .
it is n't lit yet .	you should n't even carry cigarettes on board !
listen we 're not supposed to piss either but that does n't stop you from carrying `` it '' on board ? !	the rules are the rules .
... what 's your name again ?	noireuter .
and where did you say you were from ?	i did n't say ... brussels !
what 's with the voice ?	it 's nothing . it 's just the helium , because of the air pressure .
and ... does the voice come back ?	for others , yes ... for you , who knows ?
is that alcohol ? are you out of your mind ? alcohol is strictly forbidden .	hey ! d'you have any other complaints ? just make a list and we 'll stick it on the porthole ! okay ?
well , if it is n't the little frenchman ! how is the little frenchman ?	fine !
you do n't mind if i go instead , do you ?	no ...
jacques , my friend , how are you ?	enzo ...
that 's good . you never would have recognized me , huh ? check out the suit ! looking good , no ? you know i 'm the world champion ?	yes , i know .
i dove 315 feet !	great !
why ?	because i 'm sure you 're dying to beat me .
i do n't want to be in any competition ... i dive because i like to , not to beat a record ... do n't you have to be very mad at somebody to want to beat him ?	no . all you need is to want to be the best .
you 're the best , enzo !	that 's too easy ! every time i beat a record there 's always some dumbshit asking me : `` d'you know that french guy , mayol ? he 's supposed to be very good ! too bad he does n't compete . '' so , you 're going to come with me to taormina ! first , because you 're my friend and second , because you do n't have one reason to keep on spoiling my pleasure . ... i 'll see you there ...
i remember . hi roberto !	what room have you got ?
i do n't have one .	you do n't have a room ? paolo ? what did i just hear ? i personally called you to reserve a room for my good friend jacques mayol and you treat him like a stranger ? !
it 's okay , enzo . i 'll go somewhere else .	not only is jacques mayol a very special friend , but he happens to be one of the best divers in the world ! and you 're throwing him out ! are you crazy , or what ? stupido !
... so , after all these years , you must have lots of questions to ask . am i right ?	yes , of course . lots of questions .
well , what are they ?	i 'm sorry ... i do n't know how to ask the questions .
that 's good .	how do you make a living ? your experiments , does it pay well ?
it 's okay .	... you married ?
no .	me neither , 'cause of my mother . she 's a curse , my mamma , a tornado . stubborn as a mule ! i was engaged ... for a week . after that , mamma was so mad , i tell you , pasta was bouncing off the walls .
so , not married . well , good for you . you play the field , like me . a girl in every port , huh ?	exactly , i mean , after all , we 're men !
damn right ! that 's what i tell them when people say you 've turned into a fish .	people say that ?
no , no !	not at all !
enzo ?	what ?
your mother ?	ahi , ahi , cazzo ! ma mamia ! where ... ? god , she 'll kill me ... ... if she catches me eating pasta in a restaurant .
madame ...	... and his friend , johana ...
c'mon , you two ... jacques , we have to get ready for the ceremony tonight . we have a new world champion .	i 'm a little tired , i do n't know if ...
no .	then , it 's very chic . avanti !
why ?	... for the mermaids .
today at lunch , you asked me if i had any questions .	ah ha . you finally want to know about women .
why ? are they what 's most important ?	no ... it depends ... sometimes they are ... what , exactly do you want to know ?
... everything .	everything about what ?
why ?	if we do n't ... i 'm going to beat you .
two years younger than you .	as i said , second of all you 're too skinny . you 've got tiny lungs . i still do n't understand how you can dive without getting sick .
the size of the lungs has nothing to do with it !	look at me . these are n't lungs . these are ... tanks . how long can you hold your breath ?
tell me , why do n't you go and get your medal ?	because pasta should be eaten `` al dente '' . so the trinket will just have to wait a bit .
no , i have to ask you a favor ... you 're the only one who 'll understand .	... i 'm listening .
hey ! will you slow down ! when did you learn how to drive ?	driving is n't the problem , it 's remembering the right road .
good night .	you do n't need a stretcher to take her with you . you know that , do n't you ?
what ?	the dolphins are n't the only ones who do n't feel very good sometimes .
here ... here ...	what is it ?
you still collect them ?	yes .
you do n't have that one , do you ?	no . thank you . it 's really beautiful .
can i come in ?	no problem , i enjoy talking in my sleep .
he does n't like us .	so what ! ? his job is to hand out the paychecks . and he does that very well , let me tell you .
... i was seventeen , i loved her so much i tried to die for her . two years later i could n't even remember her name ! let me tell you , time erases everything !	i do n't want to erase anything .
you 'd rather think about it and make yourself miserable ?	... yes .
i give you this . you 're stubborn ... dumb , but stubborn .	thank you .
anybody can have a bad day !	i 've had many ... when the sea does n't want you .
enzo , enzo ! congratulations !	thank you , thank you very much !
that 's good .	enzo , do n't be angry . i was lucky ... that 's all .
... how long was i asleep ?	long enough to die . listen , if you really want to die , that 's your problem , but do n't do it under my nose , okay ?
i 'm concentrating .	we ca n't dive anymore . they want to cancel the competition for a while .
it 's not safe , they say . the doctors say it is n't possible to go deeper and live . free diving is over as a sport .	you say that because you have the title !
no ! i would never cheat you .	well that 's very nice of you .
you were right .	... i was right about what ?
... push me back in the water ...	i ca n't .
do n't you have a heater ?	yeah ... sure ... is this your first trip to peru ?
a drink to warm up ?	yes , thank you . intravenous if possible .
tea ... or whiskey ?	... both . did i just see a man in a red suit and goggles ?
would it be out of place to ask what he 's doing ?	who ?
i recognize you .	we saw each other a little while ago .
in the lake ?	no ... in the hut .
please , have a seat .	thank you . i would n't want to interrupt anything .
but what brought you to sicily ?	i was doing an insurance investigation in palermo . i work for an insurance company . so , i decided to take a few days off . i do n't know this island at all . it really is gorgeous .
no , no . you 'll like it . it 's superb .	... okay . i 'll try .
thanks for helping with the bag . it looks great !	i thought it was a nice place . is n't it ?
you 're going to be very busy these days are n't you ?	i do n't know ... why ?
yes ... maybe ... i do n't know . i do n't like competitions ... it ruins the fun . do n't you think ?	i guess ... but you know ... i 'm american and i 've mostly been taught to be competitive ... there 's always pleasure of being the best ?
i thought you 'd be at the dinner .	it 's too loud for me .
you look adorable .	thank you ...
please move slowly , you 're rocking the boat .	lucky i was there to save you .
you jumped in ?	only to help the medics , i assure you .
no . i want to show you . is it ruined ?	well , water is n't exactly the best thing for pictures ... not even for pictures of dolphins ...
just checking up on your family . i guess i was drunker than i thought and the idea of going back to my hotel in a wet dress ... well ...	i 'm glad you stayed . thank you .
i 'd better get back now .	you ... you would n't want to spend the day with me ?
... no ?	no ? huh ? yes , of course ! !
how can you tell it 's a female ?	... the way she moves .
she 's not like the others . she ca n't stand to be away from the sea .	how do you know that ?
can i come watch you dive tomorrow ?	uh ... yes , of course !
jacques , you set a world record .	i did ?
i 'm going back home .	why ?
because one should n't fall in love with creatures from the sea .	i 'm not from the sea ... i do n't understand what you 're talking about .
yes you do . you know exactly what i 'm talking about . you 're afraid i want to hold onto you , and i do , but you 're not ready ... at least not for me .	but it 's not true , i feel good with you ... it feels right ...
hello ?	it 's me ... johana .
how are you ?	i got fired .
so have i . ... hello ?	i 'm still here .
well , then , talk to me some more .	... it 's hard you know . you 're so far away and i do n't know what else to say .
then , tell me a story .	uh ... ah ! a story ?
do you know how it is ? do you know what you 're supposed to do to meet a mermaid ?	no ... tell me .
hello ?	it 's me again .
i 'm being a pain , huh ?	... not at all .
you sure ?	absolutely positive .
why did you take me to the hotel , if you live here .	you 'll understand .
bonjour monsieur ... louis .	uncle louis . he 's a 75 year old amazing guy , is n't he ?
and you ?	i did n't dive .
you 'll try again tomorrow ?	i do n't know ... it did n't feel right . i 'm going to bed . i 'm tired .
what ?	... nothing .
what are you doing ?	i 'm putting you on the coin ... your essence ... that way you 'll always be with me when i dive .
jacques ... ?	you go back , i 'll walk .
what 's wrong ?	it 's nothing . just the long trip . i 'm a little jet-lagged .
you want to lie down for a while ?	no , i 'll be fine . can you just hand me a glass of water ?
... when you dive ... with that machine ... what does it feel like ?	... the feeling of slipping without falling ... the hardest is once you are at the bottom .
why ?	because you have to find a good reason to come back up again ... and i always have a hard time finding one .
you 've got to tell me what happened ?	i saw how it has to be .
jacques ? i 'm pregnant .	that 's good ... that 's wonderful . it 's wonderful for you .
promise me one thing .	anything .
mayol ... mayol ... no reservation .	... are you sure ?
this is the hotel san domenico ?	yes sir , and it has been so for 127 years .
yes , but ... so , you have n't got a room left ?	no sir , the hotel is full because of the diving championship .
you should n't dive everyday , papa .	then you should n't eat everyday , jacques .
hey ! have you ever seen a mermaid ?	no .
why do n't you ask me ?	what ?
assassin !	uncle louis , this is my friend johana .
did you buy the cassettes ? the wagner , the berlioz ?	i brought johana to meet you .
are you crazy ? i have no use for a woman ! since my accident .	no , no . johana is visiting me .
where are you from , henrietta ?	johana ... new york .
what kind of name is that ? to be named after a city ?	he does n't hear too well .
uncle louis !	no , no . it 's true . when i was in new york , oh boy ! before my accident , you understand ?
good . that way i 'll see more of you ... where are you going to stay ?	well ... here .
in my apartment ?	it 's my apartment .
liar ! thief ! torturer ! when you were an orphan i nursed you at my breast .	uncle louis , we have a guest !
uncle louis , you remember enzo 's mother signora molinari from amorgos ?	the whale ! how could i forget ? always was something fishy about that woman !
what were italians doing living in greece anyway ?	louis , we were french !
i changed the lock you son of a bitch !	... sally ?
you 're back ! hello . we were burgled .	again ?
... and the new stereo .	i hope they remembered to take the microwave this time ?
yep . how was your trip ... ? help me clean up , okay ?	you called the police ?
well ?	what ?
how was your trip ?	nice ... very interesting ... great ! ... i guess .
it 's his heartbeat .	oh jesus ... ! i 'll make some coffee . they left the stove .
i thought you said he was peruvian ?	have n't you been listening ?
... since eight o'clock last night ... ! you 're in love .	do n't be a jerk . there 's no such thing as love at first sight .
... and if we repaint the walls , we 'll need new curtains , you put the painters on you visa and i 'll do the curtains on american express ... for the couch there 's bloomingdales ... or are you still over your limit ?	way past it .
does that have a hidden meaning ?	no . i 'm just depressed .
you look it too . you have n't been working out , you have n't been taking your vitamins ! you have n't been drinking your herbs , you have n't been ...	i know , i know ! i 'm a terrible person ... it 's ... i 'm so damn , damn sad .
what is it honey ... the frenchy ?	do you think i should have stayed ? do n't you think maybe i should have stayed ? i 've been a jerk , right ? i should have stayed ! i was supposed to be in love ... i was in love ! i am in love , why did i act like a bitch ? he went swimming . all the man did was go swimming ! i must be crazy . it was too good to be true .
what are they for ?	they 're paramedics . they wait at 180 feet .
if there was a problem , they could do something right ?	of course , that 's what they 're for .
... and those ?	those are the divers who go down 300 to 330 feet . they dive with a helium-oxygen mixture . at that depth , compressed air is too dangerous because it contains carbon dioxide .
what 's that little air bottle on the machine ?	that is n't for the divers actually . it 's for the balloon . it blows up and pulls the diver up like an elevator . without it , with the pressure at the bottom , the diver would just stay pinned to the sea bed .
but does n't jacques dive without anything ?	yes ... it 's magic .
who ... who is that ?	mayol ... jacques mayol .
... the truck fell into a very deep crevasse . we were n't able to save the equipment .	i 'll have to talk to the driver .
my dear , science is a cruel mistress .	but ... how is he going to breathe ?
he 's in the fluoroscope now . listen to his heart . impressive , huh ? the flow of blood is concentrated in the brain and does n't even feed the limbs anymore . it 's a phenomena that has only been observed with dolphins ... until now .	how long can he stay down ? without breathing ?
it depends . he should come up soon . unless he 's decided to stay for the night .	why is he doing this ?
should n't somebody take him a blanket or something ?	coffee might be nice .
will he understand spanish ?	his mother 's an american . he spent half of his life in the states . i 'd try english if i were you .
okay , listen , just get the custom 's office to send me a copy as fast as possible . we ca n't send you new equipment until our file is complete . okay ?	okay , okay . you 'll have it by the end of the week , how 's that ?
you 've made me a happy insurance person .	then , goodbye .
wait ! professor ... ?	... yes ?
i 'll go see how he 's doing .	let him sleep .
alright mordechai , now that we 're alone i just want to say that i 'm not happy about this . i do n't want a repeat of that incident in the west bank .	i got the job done did n't i ? i did what i had to do .
a settlement completely demolished , ten smashed army jeeps , four dead arabs . g dash d damn it , hammer ! you think you 're above the ten commandments ? just find santa claus and bring him back to us . no heroics , got it ?	hey , it 's your bar mitzvah . i 'm just readin ' the torah portion .
i guess i could be chalant about it , but then again i 'm not even sure if that 's a word . listen chief , we could stand around arguing all day , but i got ta case to crack .	what 's your first move ?
chief , it 's me . listen carefully . i need for the worldwide jewish media conspiracy to mass produce video copies of every hollywood movie ever made featuring a positive jewish protagonist as its lead .	you mean you want us to make copies of yentl , fiddler on the roof , and chaim potok 's the chosen ?
it was a trap . i 'm back at square one .	well , then i 've got good news for you . we just got word that he 'll be making an appearance at the mall of america today . i 'm sending esther to meet you there at once .
good thinking . we 'll disguise ourselves as a gentile couple to pass undetected . now that he thinks i 'm dead , this should be a piece of homentashen .	one last thing hammer . you take care of yourself . the ...
mordechai . thank god you 're here .	what 's up ?
looks like i got a plane to catch .	take esther with you , you 'll need the backup .
so why the long face ?	it 's esther . santa 's got her .
please . will you help me ?	i love her sir . if i do n't help you , i wo n't be able to make her my wife . mohammed ali paula abdul rahim has agreed to come with me to the north pole on a rescue mission .
there wo n't be any need for that sir .	hammer , the fate of my daughter rests solely in your hands .
so . do you have a name ?	it 's esther .
you like my mordechai , yes ?	he 's ... he 's very nice . but mrs. carver , the fate of hanukkah rests solely in his hands . please , you have to help me .
hanukkah , shmanukkah . it is n't even one of the high holidays . what concerns me more is that my boychick is almost thirty , and has yet to settle down with a nice jewish girl . i 'll make you a deal . i 'll help you with your little hanukkah problem if you help me with my mordechai .	what do you want me to do ?
well , for starters , we 're going to honeymoon in boca for a week . and then , when we get back , morty 's been talking about taking a stable , good paying job as a consultant for the jdl .	well , i could n't be happier for the both of you .
mr. jefferson carver ?	please , call me mordechai .
from the way she carried herself i could tell she 'd been around the block a few times ...	sorry i 'm late . traffic was a pisher , and i 've been circling the block for the past half hour looking for parking . what are you listening to ?
client notes . sorry . what can i do for you ?	my name is esther . chief bloomenbergensteinenthal from the jewish defense league desperately needs to speak with you .
how is old chief bloomenbergensteinenthal ? is he still shtooping every girl he can get his hands on ?	actually , his days of marital infidelity have long since past . now he just shtoops my mother exclusively .
your mother ? oh . whoops .	mordechai , santa claus has been rubbed out by his son damian . the man 's a demon . there 's no telling what this new anti semitic psycho santa is capable of .
oy vey , i 'm stuffed .	i do n't think i could eat another latke if you paid me .
any sign of santa ?	he must be behind that curtain . relax . we 're undercover . we need to give off the appearance of calm . you see esther , the trick to undercover work is to try and blend in . act as a gentile would .
what are we going to do ? we 're at least an hour from the front .	c'mon follow me .
that got annoying fairly quickly .	yeah , no kidding .
so , now what ?	now we wait for santa to make his next move .
want to get a drink ?	sure . why not .
what was that ! ?	i said , do you come here often ! ?
what ! ?	i said , yeah , about once a week !
sorry . i 'm better with men .	maybe we should try a different kind of dancing .
mordechai ?	yes esther .
i want you to talk dirty to me .	oh . okay .
i want for our children to go to private schools and take music lessons . little abraham will go to stanford for college , batya will go ivy league , maybe vassar .	keep going .
also , on a daily basis , i want you to tell me what to do , where to do it , and how i should live my life .	kiss me you semitic stud !
your mother was right . you do work too hard .	oh , she said that , did she ? what else did mommy dearest have to say ?
when did you guys have this conversation ? when i was in the bathroom ? what else did she have to say ?	relax morty , i think your mom is wonderful . she cares so much about you . get this , while you were gone she said she 'd help me get you to work with the jdl if i 'd come eat by you once in awhile . like i needed any incentive to be with you . she 's so ...
oh my god . she 's become my pimp . and she 's whoring her bitch-son out to the highest bidder .	no . it 's not like that . you 're being completely neurotic . i was just playing along ...
we do !	i 'm sorry esther , i just do n't think we can see each other romantically anymore .
what are you doing here ?	mordechai , i love you . i could n't let you do this alone .
i love you too . i 'm sorry about freaking out yesterday . i was wrong .	i forgive you .
esther !	mordechai !
esther !	mordechai !
you two know each other ?	we go to the same temple .
shabat shalom mama . i brought some manischewitz . the black label .	i can see . and you also brought a nice girl to come eat by us .
mordechai . do you love your mother ?	mom , stop with this already . of course i love you . you 're my mother .
mom , i have a real job . i do good things for this community . i help people .	when i play bridge with all the girls , everyone has what to talk about with their sons . they show pictures . their sons are lawyers and doctors and rabbis . why ca n't i show a picture ?
so do n't show a picture .	you know my friend maureen ? her son , the investment banker ? he paid for her entire retirement in boca raton . what a mench he is . instead of schleping to save hanukkah , god forbid you should go back to business school and get an mba . maybe then you could send me to boca , too .
i do n't want to argue with you . let 's just eat in peace .	no . no . we 're gon na argue . and you know what mom ? i 'm going to save hanukkah just to spite you . and when my face is all over the television . when your friends are opening their hanukkah gifts next year , do n't mention it to them , okay ? i would n't want you to have to show my picture .
let 's let your tuchus breathe .	mom , why do n't you put that cat out of its misery ?
... and the opportunity to help my brothers and sisters in the jewish community .	well i 'm just glad you 're safe bubba shaina , and eating by your mother for shabos .
... and their children will all be able to eat latkes and spin dreidels , and light the menorah with the knowl ...	... so you saved hanukkah mr. big shot . i mean , let 's be honest mordechai , it is n't even one of the high holidays .
well i have news for you mom . it is good enough ... i 'm good enough and i wo n't leave here until i hear you tell me ...	mazel tov !
hello mazel tov ! a boojee boojee boojee boo ...	... i 'm not finished yet , mom .
mom ! we 're eating !	what a good poop you made in your diaper mazel tov ! that 's right ! mommy loves you ! such a good boy you are !
happy hanukkah tikva .	happy hanukkah morty .
okay , what 's the information ?	she said to remind you that you 're having shabat dinner by her tomorrow and also to remind you to bring the manischewitz .
anything else ?	yeah , i 'm going to be out of the office from 1:30 to 3:00 on sunday . i have a terrible yeast infection and i need to see my gynecologist .
but we 're not open on sundays .	i understand that . i just thought that you might want to know .
so morde-chai , tell me , what brings your bad self down to the klf ?	i 'm back on the job for the jdl . you hear about that crazy white boy who took over as santa ?
actually , i ... i do n't . what does that mean ?	oh . it means that santa 's gon na fuck hanukkah 's shit up .
you watch your back hammer . hanukkah might just be his first move . for all we know kwanzaa could be next . there 's a lot of brothers counting on you . if you fail ...	okay , look . i 'm going to work really , really hard on this one . but , please stop with the pressure . i 'm already tense as it is .
what 's wrong with him ?	he 's still working out some identity issues .
it 's gon na be tough , but the back entrance looks like our best bet .	i wanted to ask you , how were you able to pinpoint the exact location of santa 's workshop ? we 've been trying to gain that piece of surveillance for years .
cool . what 's it do ?	now this might get a bit technical , but try and stay with me . using a highly sophisticated connection of other computators , called the internet , i can access surveillance maps , villian biographical information , and even sports scores with a few simple keystrokes of this electronic typewriter .
man , that 's far out ! hey , the jets won !	but wait , there 's more . with a few swift clicks of this hand-computer interface , commonly referred to as a mouse , i can download illicit pornographic material and even send it along to a friend via a cyber postal route known as e-mail .
porno ? you 're tellin ' me that you can get porno on that thing ?	oh yeah . take a look .
what are you doing ?	just praying to god that we do n't kill ourselves going over this wall .
wait ! before we enter , you need to know that my research has determined that santa 's compound is wired with the xp 2000 stereo type alarm system .	a stereo type alarm system ?
how do we bypass it ?	the alarm will trigger if the system detects any non-w.a.s.p . tendencies inside the building . for example , if you were to dribble a basketball , or eat watermelon , or use the word dawg ... that is , spelled with an aw as opposed to the letter o ... within the confines of this workshop , the alarm would sound .
listen cat , i 'll have you know that i hate the taste of watermelon and am a terrible basketball player .	well that 's good news for us . it means the system is outdated . this should be easy . c'mon .
what are you doing ?	offscreen gunfire . that jewish atomic clock stuff ate up a lot of our budget .
hammer , you alright ?	everything 's kosher . watch him for me .
sorry folks , i do n't do couples .	if you keep your mouth shut and come with me , you wo n't get hurt .
let me guess , you 're the goy who stole hanukkah .	the hebrew hammer ! you 're alive .
what 's your shpiel , santa ?	whoa , whoa there . c'mon mordechai , is this any way to treat an old family friend ? let 's cut out all the unpleasantness . i admit , i went way overboard with the whole hanukkah thing . let me make it up to you . how about a peace offering ? girls .
what are you doing ?	i 'm just calming the kiddies . there 's no need to worry about santa . he 's just having a peaceful , adult conversation with his nice jewish friend , the hebrew hammer .
hey everybody . how 's it hangin ' ?	in fact , he 's just informed me that he personally plans on cancelling christmas this year .
where 's my girlfriend santa ?	i do n't have to tell you anything hammer ! you 're gon na have to kill me before i tell you !
i shlepped all the way to the north pole for this ? i come to fight you , and you do n't even put out anything to nosh on ? what kind of arch nemesis are you ?	hah ! jewish guilt . well , it wo n't work on me hammer . i 'm too strong for it .
so , what 's our first plan of attack santa ?	while i was in taiwan negotiating the solution to our labor problems , i came across a factory that illegally manufactures the most addictive , jewish pride weakening substance on the planet . i bought the entire plant .
what should i charge ?	oh , that 's the beauty of it . these are free samples .
so what 's in the boxes ? heroin ? cocaine ?	worse .
bootleg copies of the frank capra classic , 'it 's a wonderful life . '	that 's some cold shit .
so , how was i ?	it was good . very chilling , but you still got all the points across that we talked about .
i was n't too over the top ?	no , it was the perfect level .
you okay ?	no . i 'm airsick you asshole ! where the hell did these reindeer learn to fly ?
get off of me you cripple !	what are we gon na do ? he 's got us on the ropes .
what 's going on ? why 'd he stop ?	maybe he ran out of ammo .
well , he 's kinda just resting in the corner with his girlfriend .	resting ?
what day is it ?	it 's friday .
you want me to be nice to him for no apparent reason whatsoever , buy him clothing he 'll never wear , and for just one day of the year pretend to forgive him for all the horrible things he did to me as a young boy when my mommy was n't looking ?	no dipshit , i want you to kill him .
is someone with you -- can i get you a drink ?	why not ?
my soninlaw . what do you think of him ?	that depends . how much money has he ?
when you marry champagne , clo-clo , you ca n't trade it in for beer . you 're stuck with it .	i ca n't understand that fancy talk . you mean i 'm a gold-digger ? sure , i 'm a gold-digger -- why not ?
maybe i should just forget all about money - - forget about mamma and the kids and the rent , huh - marry some poor dope like -- oh , like carlos dominguez - - and get fat and -	who 's carlos dom-what's-his-name ?
nobody . a boy who works in a grocery .	good looking ?
mmmyes .	nice fellow ?
is he in love with you ?	i do n't know -
why do you ask so many questions ? what difference does it make how carlos and i feel ? feeling does not buy clothes and houses !	drink your beer and do n't get so excited .
this is for `` mama and the kids . ''	what about me ?
here is something that should interest charlie - a stone leopard head made by his ancestors some six hundred years ago . they used it in ceremonies . the jaguar -- in fact all the cat family -- were considered the personification of force and violence in their religious rites .	it do n't look like a leopard to me .
well , charlie , just why do you think your cat did n't kill the contreras girl ?	you know -- not scared enough . nothing to scare it .
oh , i 'm only exploring your theory . let 's take a step further . you drink , do n't you , charlie ?	i drink .
then what do you do ?	i sleep it off .
but between the time you leave the cant ma and fall into bed in that old truck of yours , what happens , charlie ?	i do n't know .
now i know i did n't hurt nobody when i was drunk - -	of course , not , charlie . i never thought you did .
ca n't make a buck without my leopard . i tell you , mr. manning , you got ta find that cat for me -- or pay up .	look , charlie , just be patient . i 'll fix everything . you do n't want that cat , anyway . it killed two people .
no , sir . that girl in the cemetery ? my cat did n't kill that girl . i told you cats do n't go around looking for trouble . if that cat 's alive , it 's out in the country hiding under a bush , starving to death .	you really think so , charlie ?
that cat ai n't mean . i feed him out of my own hand for six years . why do n't he kill me ? at night in the truck , i let him out of the cage . when i am falling asleep i hear him walking back and forth . i go to sleep . he do n't hurt me .	they all say the cat killed this second girl .
they do n't say it to me .	i 'd like one of them to say it to you , charlie . i 'd like to have you hear his side of it his reasons . want to hear them ?
sure .	let 's get in your truck .
where 's that man ?	up at the museum .
sure , i like my leopards	but he admitted quick enough that it killed the first girl .
sure !	no . i 'm serious about this .
charlie was n't drunk last night .	yes , i was drunk , mr. manning .
i 'm sick .	here have a cigarette . he was only kidding .
i do n't know . i want to see robles .	what do you want to see him for ?
i want him to lock me up .	look , charlie , you did n't do it , and you know you did n't .
two hundred and fifty dollars you owe met	you found the leopard !
what 's left of him .	where ? where did you find it ?
north -- in an arroyo , shot through the head - maybe week ago . no good , skin , everything gone	what arroyo - how did you get to it
and here is three tree mesa -- and here i go out of the big arroyo --	that 's the place : i remember - my feet were so darn sore , i could n't make it -- and galbraith went on up to the head of the canyon by himself --
it 's a blackcard and bad card , but not the card of the cat - not the card of fourfooted things .	i saw teresa . maybe i was the last to see her except perhaps her mamacita and her little brother . i was going past --
) they buried teresa today and they were hunting the leopard again -- out in the country this time . but they did n't get him .	they 're fools . why do n't they let charlie how-come hunt it alone . he 's an indian .
what did they say before the bad card came up ?	you 'll meet a rich man and he will give , you money .
you and your cards . meet a rich man ! i look for them with money . what rich man has n't money . and for what was i born if it was n't for money ? you 're not telling me anything .	watch and see , a day or a week - but certainly this month -- you will have money from a man and then-
well -- did he give you a lot of money ?	who ?
cut .	what are you doing that for ?
something black - something on its way to you	go on -
do n't look at it !	let me see it
the death card - -	maybe not - cards mean different things different times --
see you tomorrow -	tomorrow -
he will be waiting ...	you must say that you went to take some of the roses to your father 's grave ...
pedro is waiting for me , too .	rosita i have wondered -
what , senorita ?	when you are going to see pedro , does your heart beat until you tremble ?
love is different for different people .	i suppose so . i suppose it will be different for us , too when everyone knows . then we will be just like other people . but these last weeks will always be our secret a lovely secret to remember all our lives .
it may sound like music to her -- i can do better with my teeth in a cold shower . click click click .	she 's a local . when the dudes come out to new mexico , they went to wallow in latin glamour . this is a bad town for blondes .
yes . so i 've noticed . jerry 's noticed - he 'll come up with something .	you think be 's pretty nice , do n't you ?
why not ? he 's a good press agent and a good friend . besides , we 've shared a lot of headaches	you 're lucky . i wish he 'd front page for me .
i mean you being a star and me being just a cigarette girl .	i know . i know . you 've got the talent . i got the breaks .
and if you 've got cold feet honey , ill take over for you . that red dress of yours fits just perfect on me .	i bet you try on my coffin some day -- i hope it `` fits just perfect . ''
oh , dear -- i do n't know what i 'm going to do without you - honestly , i do n't	hey i 'm over here .
oh , mr. galbraith ! i 'm so glad you 're here .	good evening .
you know all about these things - - and i 've lived here all my life - and i still do n't know what the procession means .	it 's to remind people of the great tragedy that took place here so that they wo n't ever forget that a peaceful village of indians was wiped out by the conquistadores , back in the 17th century ... a band of monks buried the dead and prayed for them and did penance for their deaths that 's what this procession is supposed to be .
oh , that 's so interesting !	well , now that you 've had your history lesson , i think i 'll get on to the museum .
show business ?	yes . it 's always fascinated me . you know , once , when i was a youngster , i went to see mrs. leslie carter in `` zaza . '' after the play i stood in the alley just to watch her come out .
well , i 'd best be off .	i want to ask you something .
it 's about the leopard .	you 're worrying about its killing someone else ?
yes . i want to go out and patrol the town - be everywhere at once - be sure nothing happens to anybody .	of course . it 's the way any decent man would feel in your position .
you know about animals -- their habits -- will it come back ?	no . i 'm quite sure .
there is no danger at all . it 's a wild animal . do you think a wild animal prefers walls , streets and people when it can get into open country ?	that 's right , of course .
doc -- something you said the other day --	yes ?
it does n't jibe with this you told me the leopard would go out into the country - it would n't stay in the city	sure -- certainly - but what 's that got to do with this ?
that 's what i do n't understand -- why should it come here -- and why did n't it stay here ? it 's got trees and bushes here -- outside nothing but cement and asphalt .	jerry , i talked to you about the habits of an ordinary wild leopard . this leopard is another matter entirely - - a caged animal travelling around with charlie how come for years and years.. that 's why it kills human beings .
why ?	it does n't know how to hunt its natural prey .
but it does n't eat what it kills .	caged animals are unpredictable . they 're like frustrated human beings . i ca n't answer your question .
just a minute , robles . let him go on .	i can understand about the cat killing the first girl . charlie how come told me . all that noise and those lights -- scared crazy it would do anything . last night there was nothing to disturb it . just a little girl alone in a cemetery .
you know charlie how-come ?	we 're old friends .
come to look around ?	more or less .
charlie and i were talking . that 's one reason i wanted to see you .	about charlie 's leopard ?
charlie does n't think the leopard killed the girl in the cemetery .	charlie likes his leopard .
it could be a man .	it could be . why would a man kill her ? for what ? it was n't robbery . it was n't a crime of jealousy or passion . she had no enemies .
there are all sorts of men . you get to see some funny ones as a reporter .	i can understand what you mean - demented men , pathological cases . but what sort of man would kill like a leopard and leave the traces of a leopard ?
some crazy guy .	but he would have to know about leopards - have access to leopard claws and hair .
we had given up digging in a certain barrow . i went back and i tried again . i just had a hunch .	a hunch -- that 's all i 've got about this leopard thing . it 's just a hunch , yet i feel it deep in the stomach . it was a man !
yes , but what sort of a man ?	i do n't know .
come on , charlie . let 's go find another and better suspect .	do n't you want to see the rest of the exhibit ?
you must admit it 's possible that it might have been a man .	just barely possible - - yes .
you know a lot . you 've taken a lot of fancy courses in colleges and that kind of stuff - - what kind of a man would kill like that ?	but all those fancy courses were about the dead , jerry , not the living .
yes . there have been men who kill for pleasure -- strange pleasure . there was blue beard in france -- jack the ripper in london . it 's not uncommon .	if there were a man like that , with a kink in his brain around here loose , what would he be like .
to the eye ? like other men .	i do n't mean that . how would he act ? what would he do ?
he 'd act normally when he was with other people . it would be a man who suffered remorse and even pity when it was all over .	could n't you tell a man like that when you saw him ?
no . he would be a hard man to find , jerry . particularly if he were a clever men . he would go about his ordinary business calmly and coolly except when the fit to kill was on him .	you 've thought of all this before . you know it is n't the leopard do n't you ?
it was you , galbraith !	no .
it was you .	not ! i tell you . no !
you shot the leopard . we know that . you killed consuelo . you killed clo clo . then tonight --	i did n't do anything . she screamed . something frightened her .
consuelo screamed too -- and clo clo . why did you do it ? why ? quick . tell me why ?	it 's better you do n't know .
tell me .	why do yo & amp ; i accuse me ? you do n't know what you 're doing -- you do n't understand -- nobody understands --
tormented -- ? why ?	i could n't rest - i could n't sleep . all i could see was teresa delgado 's body -- broken -- mangled . i saw it day and night . it was waiting everywhere i turned .
then you found the leopard --	i did n't want to kill , but i had to . i heard her in the cemetery - talking to the man in the auto --
jerry told me you were an expert with animals , mr. galbraith . could n't you tell where it went ?	to know where that leopard went - i 'm afraid you 'd have to be a leopard and think like a leopard . i was a naturalist . that hardly qualifies me as an expert in hunting down lost leopards . i used to teach zoology in a little freshwater college back east . i gave that up .
what do you do now ?	there 's a little museum here in town . they 've hired me to run it , we 've some interesting exhibits of indian arts and crafts . it 's fun -- and i like living here in new mexico .
why did you give up teaching ?	various reasons . but i ca n't see why you 'd be interested in the rather dusty career of william galbraith teacher , naturalist , curator -- when you lead such a gay and exciting life yourself .
so you see meeting you is a real thrill for me .	well , i 'm hardly mrs. leslie carter whoever she was . in fact , i 'm not even much of a success around here particularly after the backfire on jerry 's little publicity stunt with the leopard .
that was unfortunate .	that was a calamity !
well , i 'm next . you wo n't hear anything like that , mr. galbraith . i 'm not a popular favorite since i let the leopard loose .	i 'm sure if you are as talented as you are charming , miss walker , you have nothing to worry about .
i 've disturbed you . i 'm sorry -	miss walker -- i did n't expect anyone
of course . only i 'm afraid you 'll be cheated . there is n't much of a view of the procession here .	i thought they came right past here
wait	no - really , i can see them -- they 're coming now - turn off the lights
you can go now , manning . there is no way we can hold you legally responsible .	thanks , sheriff .
i have n't done any posse work since last time i rode with toni mix at the old bijou theatre -- aged six , if you 're interested ,	go on foot .
that 's why it just mauls and tears at them .	something 's wrong with this whole setup --
yes , there is something wrong . people who want publicity and do n't mind how they get it -- what risks they make other people run - - what agony and sorrow they bring to other people --	i know all that , chief , and i do n't like it any better than you do , but there 's something else --
what are you getting at ?	nothing much -- just that it might not be a cat this time .
i 've been trying to tell him , sheriff . he wo n't listen to me .	let me get one thing clear . did galbraith make a direct accusation ?
state hunters ?	professional hunters , who rid the state of cougars .
yes . the lipstick .	why ?
chief , do n't you understand what this means ?	you think galbraith found the leopard on the day you went out with the posse .
galbraith knows something . he as good as said so	i am not interested in what somebody else thinks . you being me facts and i 'll act on them .
that 's a fact , is n't it ?	yes . and i am taking it to headquarters for examination .
you wo n't go to galbraith with me ?	offend a reputable citizen and involve the department in a slander suit ? no . i 'm in office to protect the taxpayers money not throw it way . come on , charlie .
get it out of here !	kiki -- he wo n't hurt you . there 's nothing to be afraid of .
makes no difference . get him out !	listen , kicks , you 'll never guess what i 've cooked up this tine ...
that 's easy . me .	i thought -- is kiki just going to walk on that floor tonight walk out cold before a bunch of gawks who think a spanish twirler is the greatest thing in life . no . not my favorite client . she 's going to make an entrance this town will never forget !
on his back , i suppose .	no . i thought that might be just a little corny . i want you to lead him in on a leash .
you 're too good to me .	look , kicks , have i ever done anything to hurt you ?
no - not yet .	and i never will- you know what 's between us we 're a thing but this is serious competition .
get it out of here !	kiki - he wo n't hurt you . there 's nothing to be afraid of .
makes no difference . get him out .	listen , kicks , you 'll never guess what i 've cooked up this time .
that 's easy . me .	i thought - is kiki just going to walk on that floor tonight walk out cold before a bunch of gawks who think a spanish twirler is the greatest thing in life . no . not my favorite client . she 's going to make an entrance this town will never forget .
on his back , i suppose .	no . i thought that might be just a little corny . i want you to lead him in on a leash .
you 're too good to me .	look , kicks , how long have we known each other ?
this is l939 . ca n't you subtract ?	almost three years , is n't it ? and have i ever done anything to hurt you ?
no not yet .	and i never will -- you know what 's between us - we 're a thing -- but this is serious -- big competition .
clo-clo ?	i thought you might strut this kitten in right in the middle of her act .
you look swell in that threealarm number --	the red dress ? no . my black one . then i 'll be just like him .
are you all right ?	now look what you 've done .
suppose i slip them a few bucks for the funeral expenses .	do n't be soft .
i suppose he was trying to make me feel bad .	and i suppose you do n't feel bad !
who was the other man ?	i do n't know a witness . he seemed to know something about animals -- you know -- expert testimony .
what did he have to do - look at the body ?	we all , had to look at the body . it was awful , kiki -- awful !
well , does everybody love us now ? you 've been gone long enough to softsoap twenty editors !	yeah .
it must be the altitude you , bucking around the countryside with a lot of bootandsaddle boys --	the whole town 's in a state , kiki doors locked , people huddling together like scared sheep nobody on the streets at night
our first real break -- and we throw wild animals at the audience	forget it . i 'm buying a drink for a fellow who was on the posse with me , a nice guy . come along he 'll get a great kick out of meeting you .
who is he ?	you remember the fellow this morning -- galbraith . you 've got time before the supper show .
as long as my feet held out .	and not a sign of the leopard ?
i can use them .	do they close up every year for this processionist business ?
that was nice of mr. galbraith .	he 's a nice guy . vie ought to keep in touch with him .
pretty . you know -- it 's funny but flowers only mean one thing to me now .	i know . funerals .
jerry , these flowers are n't really for me	you mean you want to take them to the cemetery .
and she waited here for him ?	robles says it looks that way . belmonte had already been there and left . they only missed each other by a few minutes .
why do you want to stay around here ? it 'll only make you feel badly .	maybe i want to feel badly .
what else do you care about , kicks ?	you . us .
i 'm glad you care about us , kicks . sometimes that gets kind of lost in the racket --	maybe there ought to be less racket and more us .
confession . i 'm a complete softie . i 've been conscience-stricken and worried sick ever since that leopard got away --	if that 's being a softie -- there are two of us .
kiki -- it was n't the leopard .	you 're positive of that , are n't you ?
you already know the answer to that . i want this town to be safe and happy again --	i 'm no detective . i do n't even know how to begin . all i know is i want to do something about all this .
oh , by the way -- i 'm out of cash --	did n't you take your cut out of the closing check ?
i got into a little crap game .	that 's funny -- i never knew you to lose that much before --
as a matter of fact , i 'm out of cash myself .	what ! you ca n't be --
i -- i bought some silver jewelry and stuff from eloise --	eloise does n't own enough of anything to make a dent in your pay check , kicks .
all right , i 'm not ashamed of it ! i split it two ways	half to the delgado family and half to clo-clo 's family .
no . no , thanks . now we 've got to do it ourselves .	we will
kiki ?	it 's all right . i 'm not hurt .
we stood here once before .	i know -- teresa -
i hated you that day - you and your flip talk - with that little girl lying dead .	i know . what do you think i felt when you said , `` do n't be soft ? ''
jerry , i want you to be soft . you are soft -- inside - where it matters . i wanted it that day too , but did n't dare tell you .	we ought to dare to tell each other everything , kiki -- you and i .
it 's a lovely town - it was until we came and let the leopard loose and all this happened .	kiki , galbraith said something to me once , -- something you ought to know . we were talking and he said that people were like that ball on the fountain at the hotel -- they got pushed around by things bigger than themselves . that 's the way it was with us -- and we were too small to see it that way .
hot ... these roads all round here , closed to the public ... whys that ? military bases ? huh . i guess theres space enough for war games ... must be good for business .	must it ?
all those soldiers out there ... getting bored , thirsty . come out here for refreshment or female company perhaps ?	aint nobody out there , mister .
nobody ? huh ! ... how come ?	maybe for the same reason that made someone somewhere not consider this a spot to build the getty museum ...
ha-ha ... yeah ... what about that road back there , though ? it says closed to the public , doesnt it ?	you a tourist ?
thats right .	will you please come with me ?
that might depend on where youre going .	i am lawrence , sir . mr and mrs de moraes majordomo . they are expecting you .
de moraes ? i was asked here by a mrs spitz .	that would be mrs de moraes mother , sir . mr and mrs spitz are here with their daughter .
good afternoon . de moraess residence .	could i speak to carlos or deborah ?
im afraid they are out at the moment , sir .	when will they be back ?
by the way , laurence , were you here last time your mistresss brother came over ? you know , just before he disappeared ?	i work here , sir . im here most of the time .
you wouldnt recall if the brothers-in-law left together , would you ?	you will have to ask mr de moraes that , sir . would you like a drink while you wait ?
mrs de moraes must have taken it hard , eh ? her brothers death .	dial o-o-o on the telephone if you change your mind about the drink , sir .
now you know why youre here , mr lombard . it might be difficult for someone like you to discern , but we are people of a certain standing .	appearances can be deceptive , mrs de moraes .
three weeks ago . to borrow money . i wasnt here but he got to my husband , sold him some fancy story about an exhibition of his work and needing money to get new prints made . carlos handed over 1,000 to get rid of him .	and that is the last time any ...
what about you , mrs de moraes ?	i have too much money to work , mr lombard .
is that why your brother braved coming here to ask you for a loan ?	perhaps it wasnt so brave of him . had i been here i just might have given him his money , mr lombard . one can reap rewards from the strangest of conduct , as someone in your line of work ought to know .
i wont comment on the time but youll understand if i dont tell you to sit down . now , spare me the apology and get to the point , will you , mr lombard .	im afraid i have bad news , mr de moraes . i have reason to believe your brothers in trouble .
for your information , mr lombard , trouble is possibly the one thing leon is capable of getting into all by himself . though i doubt he will not ultimately fail even at that .	i dont know . he seems to delight in so much sisterly love , he might become determined .
oh-oh ! touch , mr lombard ! but tell me , what would you know about sisterly love , eh ? no . dont . you might get confused speaking of things you dont understand and we need you clear- headed , at least until youve done what we are paying you for .	now you are confusing me , mrs de moraes .
can it be that easy ?	can it be that you want your brother found ?
i found this at your brothers .	disney ! how inter ...
its a snuff movie . prime paedophile material . im told it retails at around 4,000. i see you dont require a definition .	you ... you found that at leons ?
you seem surprised . could it be you dont think that badly of him after all ? you neednt worry . it seems his motives were pure . from what i can make out he bought the boy to rescue him from further abuse .	what ... what are you talking about ?
your brother got mixed up with child procurers and tried to make this world a better place , mrs de moraes . and having rescued one little life he unwisely set out to repeat the exercise . you dont mess around with child procurers . right now my guess is hes either on the run , held captive , or dead . i understand your misgivings , mrs de moraes . but ive seen the boy and made telephone contact with the man leon bought him from . if anyone knows what happened to your brother it will be that man . which leads me to why im here at such a late hour . i need 20,000 , in cash , by 11 this morning .	excuse me ?
i will of course do my best to hang onto it .	where is it ? he . the boy you said my brother bought ! where is he ?
i cant tell you that yet . but hes being well looked after .	oh no . youll have to do better than that , mr lombard .
how dare you ... you dont know this tape belongs to my brother , do you , mr lombard ?	the question now is whether or not your brother still owns anything , mrs de moraes .
no . the question now is how long its going to take you to get out of here , mr lombard .	excuse me ?
get out of my house . youre fired , mr lombard .	perhaps i should come back when youre ...
laurence !	i was hired by your parents , mrs de moraes .
the family hired you and i have just fired you , mr lombard .	why me , mrs de moraes ? why should such well-connected people as you hire a small- time french detective to look for their missing son , mrs de moraes ?
huh ! who do you think we are , mr lombard ?	couldnt nazi hunters do the job ?
i still dont buy your story but i figured it cant do any harm to let you go on with your enquiry . besides , if you do turn out to be nothing but a cheap little extortioner , we could always get the right people onto you . i trust you know who i am talking about .	you drive a hard bargain .
thank you for coming . come in and close the door , will you ?	last night you upset my sleep . tonight my social life . we have two minutes . my dinner guests are waiting .
you lost my money ?	you could say that . and friedman left this morning for los angeles .
who is friedman ?	the man who sold the boy to your brother .
im impressed . that information could have cost me 20,000 .	well , i found a little more than that . let me put it this way : ... last night i thought your brother might be dead , tonight im convinced he is . that said , i have no evidence and i advise you to let the police deal with it .
are we understood ?	you watched the tape ? friedman and his people dont just provide little kids and videotapes , mrs de moraes . theyre in the import-export business . they run hotels here in london which they probably use as ware- houses and ports of call for their merchandise .
huh ! really ? hotels ?	the hotels are useful capital investments . the kids liquid assets . my guess is they own hotels across the globe , and travel agencies specialising in flights from the third world to boot .
minimizes the risks . children can be moved across borders using reliable businesses . these can also be used to move women and drugs ... anything that makes money really .	w-why are you telling me all this , mr lombard ?
you drive a hard bargain , mr lombard .	you do want me to keep the job , dont you , mrs de moraes ?
mr lombard ?	have you got a pen ?
just a moment ... go ahead .	the mondrian , room 504. the number is 266 7548 , plus the l.a. code ...
are you all right ?	yes ... you woke me up ... its the middle of the night here . have you found mr friedman ?
not yet . the place i hoped to find him turns out to be little more than a contact address . ill give it 24 hours . he just might show up . if you need to reach me ask for mr lamont . paul lamont , all right ?	paul lamont ... ?
mr lombard . mrs de moraes ...	uh ... wait a moment , mrs de moraes ...
mr lombard ...	how are you , mrs de moraes ?
when did you get back ?	why dont you ask when i left the mondrian ?
im really sorry you were not called ...	youre repeating yourself , mrs de moraes .
i ... well , were burying leon tomorrow and ... look , i wish i had more time , but its late and with the funeral ...	arent you curious to know about friedman ?
black suits you .	sorry ?
or is it the other way round ? the children are needed because you cant satisfy him ?	you ... you are out of order , mr lombard . i ...
how did you break into my office , deborah ? ladies of your standing dont learn to pick locks between shopping trips . come on , deborah ! acting dumb doesnt suit you ! who knew id found dirt on your brother , huh ? who knew it was in an envelope ? taking me for dead , whod want to make sure it didnt fall into the wrong hands ?	youre mad ...
ive had a long and unpleasant day . im tired and im angry . but mad ? not yet . i paid leons boy a visit this morning . found him alive and well . why havent you told your husband where he is since reading my note , eh ?	why ... i dont know what youre talking about .
you know hed have had him killed , dont you ? does a conscience still burn somewhere inside your sore mind , deborah ? or is it just cold expediency ? could the boy perhaps come in useful when and if the day ever comes for you to face up to the man you married ?	have you finished ?
you do have a vivid imagination , mr lombard . i only wish youd use it fruitfully instead of in being obnoxious . i fail to understand your purpose in this . still , say what youre owed if you still wish to be paid or get out , all right ?	i guess the news youd sent me after friedman didnt go down too well , eh ?
whatever the reason , im sorry i did . goodbye , mr lombard . i believe you know your way out .	you knew he had nothing to do with your brothers disappearance , didnt you ?
huh ! dont you recall convincing me he had ? you should learn to live with your mistakes , mr lombard . there is some merit in it .	i take it you learnt to live with yours then . take it all the mind-dulling pills in your medicine cabinet are surplus to your well-being ...
how ... when did you ...	it must be tough being married to adonis to end up sleeping alone every night . sleep must be hard coming . whats harder ? the thought of the fine litter you two could have bred if ? or imagining what he does with his children ?
tell me , did he kill his little victims too ?	no !
what do you mean , no , mrs de moraes ?	my brother hung himself .
does the name pierre dreyer mean anything to you ? hes a client of mine and a friend of your husband .	leon hung himself .
adonis thought your brothers bodyd be found reasonably quickly when he hung it in epping forest , didnt he ? seemed like a good idea . an ex-junkie , obsessed with death ; the perfect candidate for suicide . he just forgot one thing : forest ramblers are rare during your average blustery english november . an englishman might have thought of that , but a brazilian ...	leon hung himself ...
leons not found , your parents worry , talk of hiring help to find him , even mention their manhunter friends perhaps ... and adonis panics , takes control , brings me in reckoning a small- time detective is unlikely to dig up anything awkward , not before leons found anyhow . he must have kicked himself when he learned id exceeded his expectations .	leon hung himself ...
i doubt friedman ever even met leon , deborah . friedman dealt with select customers . as for my envelope , had he know where it was he wouldnt have mistaken me for a hitman called lamont when we met in los angeles .	... you-you spoke to him ?
your brother stumbled upon adoniss little secret , didnt he ? and traded his silence for a kid and some cash . and adonis fell for it , bought him his kid , sent him away , and then killed him when he came back for more . leon didnt come here to borrow money for prints . he came to extort a second kids life . your flunkey let him in , so his visit couldnt be concealed , hence the exhibition story . there was no exhibition . just as you suspected . remember , deborah ? leon does his own prints . wouldnt want anyone to interfere with his art . i should have paid more attention to your words . perhaps its the way you say them ...	if-if my car is there , i could be the one who ... why dont you accuse me of killing my brother ?
kids are not your thing , deborah . youd have been ready for me when i turned up with sleeping beauty . damn it ! then too i should have paid more attention . not leon , you said . it struck me at the time , but obviously not hard enough . you didnt say my god ! , or whatever else well-bred ladies squeak on hearing uncle henry misbehaved . not leon . who then ? you sure were right about one thing , deborah , the job was too formidable for me . i should have thought a little more before i left for los angeles . but there i was focused so hard on friedman id stopped thinking . nothing added up - leon soliciting money for prints while buying kids at 15,000 a go ; infiltrating the world of child traffickers ; duping friedman into selling him a little boy ... you sure were right . the job was too formidable for me . but you knew that , didnt you ?	leon could still have hung himself .
youre wrong about my being there , though . carlos borrowed my car that day , his had broken down ... leon saw it , like you , assumed i was there , thought hed wait to ask for a lift . but carlos turned up , with the tape you found ... leon got his lift , and accidentally picked up the tape with his photo equipment when he got out . he watched it , confronted carlos , threatened to tell the police about the hotel ... i dont know how he knew about the hotel . perhaps carlos talked too much ... my husband did not tell me ... you more or less guessed the rest ... i didnt know any of this before you left for los angeles .	you dont say .
why did you send me after friedman ? to atone for your sins ?	i didnt know my husband and friedman knew each other . i just ... do you think we spoke about it ? ive known for five years . hes known ive known for five years ... but not once have we spoken about it . there are things one just doesnt speak about ...
one just doesnt ... tell me , what does one speak about , huh ?	think what you like . but dont presume to understand .
i dont .	good .
is there anything to understand ?	why do i feel i neednt answer that ?
rich . young . beautiful . you must at least get a kick out of what he does to his kids .	you bastard ...
five years of it . surely , youd have divorced him if he disgusted you ?	you splendid bastard ...
are there truly no extenuating circumstances ?	... were turning in circles .
and you still havent told me why you sent me after friedman .	maybe i wanted to give my husband a fright .
a fright ? ... five years of cowardice led to your brother being murdered and you wanted to give his murderer a fright ?	i didnt know who or what had happened to my brother yet , mr lombard !
what was the idea ? husband is filled with fear when he learns his child suppliers being tailed ?	something like that .
something like that ?	something like that .
what happened ? adonis slapped you about a little and you reverted to cowardice ?	here we go again .
where is that ?	simplify and damn .
dont you believe in simplicity ?	should i ?
we all have to like what we become . cowards included . we achieve this by complicating things a little . but its never that complicated really .	you seem to know what youre talking about .
perhaps it came to me while dying in a californian desert because a woman set upon giving her husband a fright got slapped about a little .	my husband didnt need to slap me about , mr lombard . i volunteered ...
to get me killed ... ?	i didnt intend it that way ... it just happened . he heard from laurence that youd been back . that wed argued . he asked why and it just happened ; i told him everything ... i couldnt help it . wanted to see him scared . i had never seen him scared before , you see ...
well , i hope you enjoyed yourself .	perhaps i did ... until fear turned into panic . thats when he hit me , and told me hed killed my brother ... you dont know what youve done , he said . were in deep trouble , he said . we , he said . we . wed both be killed if friedman ever found out you were working for us , he said . we had to stop you and friedman meeting ...
you know something ? ive just seen so much ugliness i dont think id mind four walls and dinner served every night at a regular time . id hoped to have a private word with adonis , but if thats the way you want it .	what are you doing ? you cant . i ...
do you think the boy you saved might identify your husband as his purchaser , deborah ? and then , your brothers not buried yet . as i said earlier , an autopsy will ...	he ... he is dead ! my husband is dead ! call my parents . theyll tell you . call them !
do you think wed let him get away with the murder of my brother ?	we ? you and your parents killed your husband ?
they found his body yesterday . in the pool at our house in sao paulo . he drowned . drank too much , went for a swim and drowned .	your flunkey said he was expected back tonight .
the staff dont know yet ... i called my parents , told them everything ... i just couldnt take any more ...	get to the point , will you ...
so you did talk about it , huh ?	on ... once ... once ... what are we ... you going to do ?
what do you suggest ?	i dont know . everyones dead ...
why the hell couldnt you divorce the man ?	you wouldnt understand .
i ... we have to bury leon tommorrow ...	the dead can wait .
directory enquiries . can i help you ?	yes . im trying to reach a friend but i cant get through . the number is 01766 770 471 .
theres nothing wrong with the line , sir . are you sure you have the right number ? 770 471 is the number of a call box .	a call box ? thats odd . where exactly ?
penrhyndeudraeth , north wales .	can you tell me how you spell ...
good morning , sir . how can i help you ?	a coffee and a couple of croissants .
crow what ?	croissants .
im sorry , sir . could you try that again ?	croissants . like that ...
the word for those things is croissants .	not in america , sir . you must be from europe . so , black coffee and a couple of crescents .
may i ask where youre from , mr lamont ?	europe ... france . im french but i live in london ... ... england .
you wouldnt have a cigarette , would you ?	i dont smoke . if you could get to the point ...
youre sure you wont sit down , miss stewart ?	im fine standing , thank you .
is this some kind of sick stunt ? let me guess . you want money , right ?	a small loan would be welcome . more urgently , i need access to a telephone and an address where things can be sent to me .
i cant believe this ... whats coming now , eh ? if i dont pay all hells gon na break loose , is that it ?	well , id sooner mug an old lady ...
okay . the woman just cant walk away ... i want straight answers . no hesitation or i walk for sure . why cant you go to your embassy ?	french people need a visa to enter this country . that takes time and i didnt have any . i used a british passport . my names not lamont but lombard . xavier lombard .
where were you staying before the attempt on your life and why cant you go back there ?	the mondrian , room 504. i was checked out in my absence .
by your austrian ?	yeah .
you dont know why hes come to los angeles ? the man you say he killed ? who was he ? a colleague of his ?	no . a poor little rich boy who thought hed save a few kids from their retailer . he disappeared on his second shopping expedition .
have you never heard of collect calls , mr ...	lombard ... it will take a few days for the things i need to get here . meanwhile id sooner not draw police attention walking the streets like a hungry dog ...
there are over 4 million people in this city - why me ?	i thought youd never ask ... as i was having my coffee and crescents at the mondrian the other morning i spotted your photograph in the los angeles times ... theres a tough lady , i thought . just the kind who might help me ...
you know where to look for your austrian , right ?	i know where to look .
thereve been 7 international treaties since 1904 aimed at preventing child slavery . but still no worldwide body dedicated to investigating the maltreatment of children used in sexual exploitation . officially , its just not called for . sit down . can i offer you some coffee ?	i wouldnt mind . thank you .
a recent acquisition . weve had four break- ins this year alone ; files stolen , computers wrecked , faeces smeared on walls . the good guys dismiss us as alarmist do-gooders ; the bad guys will risk prison to intimidate and rob us . an easy living indeed , mr lombard . i got through to moreau and jane . i left your landlord out of it . your flats been broken into . jane wants you to call her back .	hah ... what about nathalie ?
no answer . you have no passport and your embassys out . how do you plan to leave the u.s. , mr lombard ?	im sure ill find a way .
thank you for the guided tour , but would you mind telling me what were doing here ?	how come youre alive ? child traffickers usually achieve what they set out to do . what am i really looking at here , huh ? are you really not just a lousy private eye ? am i really looking at some kind of cunning dispenser of justice in disguise ?
its give and take time , mr lombard . you need help , we need information . you didnt really expect me to put my ass on the line helping a criminal just for the thrill of it , did you ?	a criminal ?
huh ... i have no ... ... hard evidence ...	come on , mr lombard . you tailed your man all the way here from europe . you told me you knew where to find him , remember ? or didnt i hear you right ?
a little too tight , eh ? ... they were my sons . only thirteen and already six feet tall . a real lanky boy ... i ... theres some cold chicken salad in the fridge if youre hungry .	thank you . but i think ill go to bed . its been a long day .
right ... well , ill get your money first thing in the morning , okay ? okay . goodnight then .	yeah . goodnight , emily .
what am i to do with the packages if ...	burn the passport and keep the money . think of it as a donation to the cause ...
get a pen and dont ask any questions .	oh . what ... yeah . okay .
route 395. past edwards air force base and about half a mile before a place called the red mountain motel . theres a dirt track with a closed to the public sign . it leads to some kind of ranch in the middle of nowhere . if you havent heard from me by morning send the cavalry , okay ? but not before , you hear ?	have you found your man ? is that where he is ?
look , you dont tell me about some godforsaken place where stuff so bad even i couldnt imagine it goes down and expect me to go quietly to sleep ! what happened ? whos the guy ? the austrian ?	whos the guy ? whos the guy ! nom de dieu ! had the guy got a closer look at you or your number plate id have had to kill him .
what ... ?	what ... some kind of organ factory ... pregnant girls doped up . babies . theres a lot of people back there . theyre holding a seminar . traffickings the past , breeding the future ...
friedmans dead ... they killed him ...	so who ... whos the man ? where is he ?
some italian i picked up back there . hes in the boot of the mustang .	italian ? the mafia ... ?
no one saw me but the italian and a dog . i blew up their generator . they thought it was an accident but by now they must have realised one of their party is missing . it might make them feel insecure enough to decide to pack up ...	were both thinking the same thing , right ?
call from the motel and tell him if he moves fast enough there might be something left of a body dissolving in acid . can i have the keys to your house ?	that-that wont do . thats not the way it goes . you saw it , you tell it , thats the way ...
im finished here and im tired , emily . you shouldnt be here . now dont make it worse .	a seminar in a baby breeding farm ! bodies in acid ! you think ill get anywhere with that ? jesus ! with luck i might raise a laugh . they might even send a patrol car to check the place out . whatever , itll be too late .
then find another way .	look ! either you talk or the creeps are gon na walk . for gods sake . what am i supposed to say ? i got this from a french guy from england who broke in there to have a chat with an austrian child trafficker ? is that it ?
damn it ! you cant fucking walk away from this !	its up to you whether they walk or not .
... im emily stewart . the hysterical female who sees evil everywhere since the day her thirteen year-old boy disappeared . the pain in the ass who cries wolf at the drop of a hat . however i go about this thats who i am . do you get what im fucking saying , mr lombard ?	what about your friendly cop ?
theyd never let me go . and youd end up in more trouble than you know for helping me .	you can not walk away from this . you can not .
nothing sticks to slime , emily . this should cover what you lent me .	huh ! and they say charitys only rewarded in heaven ... hallelujah ... christ ...
whitney armstrong , my deputy . what whitneys trying to say is that you might not live to tell the tale next time you meet your austrian ...	and losing you , wed lose him . and that would be a shame , dont you agree ?
hi ...	if you have hard evidence about a child trafficker , we want it , mr lombard . and we want it before you get yourself killed ...
weve still got the italian ...	thats right . wheres the fucking italian , eh , mr french hero ?
look at him , whitney . come all the way from england to clean up california . huh !	emily ...
shit ! fuck ! whats fucking wrong with people ! im going to bed . and sweet dreams to you to !	shell be alright . shes tough ...
im calling about the puppies .	have we done business before ?
i saw the ad at georges . im passing through town and im in a hurry .	may i have your phone number ?

what sort of puppy are you looking for ?	what sort have you got ?
pups . bitches . from three to twelve months . trained and untrained ones . white and brown ones . you understand ?	yeah .

have you heard of a french film called la collectionoose ?	la what ?
la collectionoose . its about a young girl in the south of france who seduces a different man every night and then meets one who resists her . its on tv tonight and as im in i thought we could perhaps look at your accounts and ... the review says its about the conflict between intellect and instinct . and witty . the directors supposed to be famous . rommel or something . french . you must know him ?	should i ?
i dont know . how many famous french film directors can there be ?	that are called rommel or something , i guess not that many .

oh ... we split up .	well , i hope youre not too heartbroken and ...
ive got work tonight , jane .	oh yeah ! better be good and hurry away then ! who knows ? we might be being watched ! maybe one of your stupid french companies has got a detective prying into your life - after all , thats what they do to their employees , isnt it ? huh ! hope you enjoy ruining peoples lives . thanks for the lift !

just ask if they can recall recommending my services to anyone in the recent past . say youre my secretary , all right ?	your secretary , huh !
id appreciate it if you could do this for me . if you cant , dont worry about it . ill call in about an hour anyway . sorry but im in a hurry .	what are you up to , eh , savieer ? i mean , not this but ... money , passports , a gun in a microwave ? who are you , eh ? who are you ?
hello , jane . its me .	really ? and how are you , eh ? someone called pierre dreyer said that a month ago he had dinner with a brazilian friend of ...
carlos de moraes ?	yes . how did ...
good afternoon , mrs ... ?	spitz . we spoke on the telephone . my husband ... my daughter , deborah , whose house this is . my son-in-law , carlos ... the gentleman is a business partner of his .
may i ... ?	may i ask if you are jewish , mr lombard ?
lombard , this is not a jewish name , is it ?	i hope its not too significant .
what if it is ?	well , i would have to point out that we could have dealt with that question when you called this morning , mrs spitz . i wouldnt like to think id kept you waiting for nothing .
whatever , you come recommended . we ...	recommended ?
must i speak to you in french ?	didnt you say i came recommended ? thats what i thought . may i know by whom ?
you may not . and besides , it is irrelevant .	okay . recommended ...
good . now , as i trust you may have guessed , we are looking for someone to work for us . someone whose discretion can be relied upon . someone who while in our employ would give us full commitment . do you think you could be that person , mr lombard ?	look mrs spitz ... i dont know to whom im indebted for the recommendation but ... im not in the business of making oaths of allegiance or giving myself character references . what i do is listen to what the people who care to call me have to say and judge whether or not i can be of help . i hope you can appreciate that , mrs spitz .
i take it your son is called leon ?	leonard . what my daughter is on about , mr lombard , is that leonard is somewhat of a bohemian . you might as well know that ...
what do you think has happened to your son , mrs spitz ?	you wouldnt be here if i knew , mr lombard . what i do know is that he has not been at work for three weeks . that enquiries to the police and london hospitals have borne no results . and that a check with his bank revealed he has not used his account for four weeks now .
how did you do that , mrs spitz ?	do what , mr lombard ?
check with your sons bank . banks dont usually give out information about their customers .	i said earlier that my husband and i are supporting leonard in his photography , mr lombard . by this i mean that since his return from america i have been depositing for him a monthly allowance in an account we jointly hold . so as you see , i did not have to break the law to find out if he used the account .
i didnt mean to imply you did , mrs spitz .	then you should not have sought an explanation .
i presume you checked your sons apartment ...	yesterday . it all looked normal .
did you look for his passport , driving licence ?	leonard does not hold a driving licence . as for his passport , i do not know where he keeps it .
so he could have decided to go on a trip ...	he could indeed , mr lombard . but had he done so i think he would have let us know about it .
i take it your son is not married , mrs spitz ?	no . and before you ask , no , hes not gay ! he has had girlfriends , but nothing serious ...
any friends ?	the proprietor of his workplace is the only friend of his we know about . his address is in this envelope with leonards address , keys and other things you might need .
im sure ... as far as you know , when and where was your son last seen ?	when ... im told he came here ...
the 1,000 is on account .	my rates ...
we are aware of your rates , mr lombard . we will pay you double your rates plus expenses . in return , need i say it again , we expect discretion and undivided attention .	why do you think your son chose not to come to you for funds for his photography , mrs spitz ?
my husband and i will be leaving tomorrow for a short stay in israel . deborah will be here if you need anything before our return .	fine . one more thing , mrs and mr spitz ; may i ask what is or was your occupation ?
10,000 a year to the girl for as long as she looks after the boy ?	plus a trust fund to provide for the boys education .
look at it this way . he might achieve everything your son never did .	jah ...
what happens now ?	we conclude our transaction .
the rooms yours for 24 hours . its sound- proofed , stocked up with food , drink and other things you might find useful . you can do anything you like .	anything at all ?
vous tes franais ?	does it matter ?
problems ?	is my money in there ?
lets go .	i dont know what your problem is , but ...
am i supposed to know him ?	six weeks ago . he bought a boy of yours .
clients come and go .	this one came back and was never seen again . i understand friedman looked after him .
where is friedman ?	look , i dont think youre fully aware of what youre playing with here , mister . whoever put you up to this either pays too well or misinformed you . why dont you just tell me what it is you want so we can do business in a civilized manner , eh ?
friedman lives with you at the ambassador ?	no . in hampstead ... why ?
this car needs petrol .	shut up and drive !
youre out of your mind . whats the idea ?	maybe the thought of people like you going on holiday bothers me . come on , lets go ...
is it real ? you people are sick .	huh . id have thought a tough guy like you would know better . the sick ones are out there , friend . they make up the clientle . get rid of them and were out of business .
only feeding the disease , eh , martin ?	money talks , bullshit walks , whether you like it or not .
maybe i dont .	maybe you should . think about it . those who can afford our goods do their thing without upsetting anyone . those who cant do it to kids from the streets or their own family and it makes upsetting headlines .
im overcome by your public-spiritedness .	boys like the one you met today are surplus . commodities worth a handful of notes in whatever arsehole of the world they happen to be born into . we improve some lives buying them where theyre not wanted , improve still more selling them where they are . is that too hard for you ?
you know what , martin ? i ought to tie you down with your old arse up in the air and advertise the hole in the middle of it to the world . free . and hope you never die .	huh ... im sure thered be lots of takers .
is this friedman ?	who are you ? who are you working for , huh ?
is this friedman , martin ? come on , scumbag . youve reached your sell- by date . tell me if this is friedman , where he is in los angeles and what name hes using ?	youre making a mistake , tough guy . whoever he is , your guys not one of friedmans ...
you seem very sure about that .	i told you ... the rabble , its me ... huh ... its sad .
what is ?	dying without ever reaching the top ...
trying to say something , martin ?	hyatt ... friedmans ... at the hyatt ...
the hyatt ... ? whats that ?	ho-hotel ... los angeles ... he ...
its about the puppy . you got the money ?	yeah .
at what time will you be available ?	three oclock .
what is it ?	this is the hotel supervisor , mr lamont . im terribly sorry to disturb you but theres been a mix-up with our bookings which you might be able to help us resolve .
what are you talking about ?	we need a double-room and as i understand youre here alone wed be much obliged if youd agree to move to a single room ...
five to three . youre early .	should i come back in five minutes ?
i gather weve done business with a friend of yours ?	have you ?
the person who put us in touch seems to think so .	i dont recollect mentioning a friend .
your lady friend did .	the ladys not a friend . shes a whore . someone at a special screening i attended mentioned certain goods could be got from an austrian here in london . and not just movies .
and while visiting our fair city you ... an austrian ?	an austrian .
an austrian ... not much to go on , is it ?	questions can amount to revelations . now , id hate to think i was made to come here carrying a substantial amount of money in order to be subjected to a cross- examination . mr friedman led me to believe we had a deal . do we ?
will you be alone ? the merchandise . is it just you or ...	ill be alone .
evening . table for one ?	no . thank you . could you tell me if leon spitz is here , please ?
leon ? no . im afraid he left .	left ? when ? i just come from his place and there was no one there . a neighbour of his ...
no . i meant he left as in no longer works here .	oh . this is ... wed arranged to meet tonight and im due to return to paris tomorrow ...
im sorry ...	yes . you wouldnt know where i could reach him ? we had to discuss an exhibition of his photographs at my paris gallery , you see ? i really need to see him before i leave .
this is private property . the public footpath is back to the left of the bridge .	how are you , rhian ?
its wet . will this do ?	wheres your wallet ? have you got a wallet ?
is this some kind of mugging ? because ...	shut up ! wheres your wallet ?
in my jacket . left inside pocket .	reach for it and throw it to me . and ... my fingers on the trigger , you hear !
a private investigator ... youre not austrian ?	should i be ?
whats a french private investigator doing here ?	can i get up now ?
no ! what do you want here ? how do you know me ?	as you know from speaking to phil , your friend leon has disappeared , rhian . his family have hired me to find him .
... leons not here . how did you get here ? phil doesnt know where i live .	well , i obviously do . and i also know that leons not here , rhian . but i thought that you might know where i should look for him .
you thought wrong . i havent seen leon for months .	havent you ? then why the worried messages on his answering machine , rhian ? id have sworn you expect him to be in trouble .
what are you going to do now ? call the police ? take him away ? i must warn you hes terrified of men , so ...	shut up !
we didnt quite make it as lovers ... leon is a good man , though ...	did leon tell you why he didnt want the police involved , rhian ?
he just said he had good reasons .	good reasons ?
thats what he said . i tried to dissuade him ... told him i couldnt take on another child , that hed get into trouble ... i mean , people who sell children ... but he wasnt listening ... i guess he finally found himself a crusade ... his family think hes back on drugs , eh ? huh ... leon did drugs . a lot of drugs . went through his self-destruct phase , you know ? things to come to terms with . demons to fight ... some peoples minds are gloriously uncomplicated . not leons . he did beat the drug , though . he did .	his mother would be pleased to hear that .
yeah ... but he didnt beat the demons ... a quarter of all the shoes sold in europe are made by or retailed through his parents leather empire . all started from a small shop in the east end of london and war reparation money for holocaust victims .	im afraid i dont understand .
theyre german jews . came here before the war . they both lost all their families in extermination camps , but they themselves never went near one . the idea that his family wealth was started with money he believes should have gone to camp survivors has been haunting leon . its not guilt , more of a curse ... and then theres something about his parents being involved with nazi hunters ... but i think thats just one of leons dark delusions ...	do you know leons parents names ?
who else knows about the boy ?	my sister ... she lives in the next valley .
is she on the phone ?	yes ... you-youre not going to take shiva away ?
i cant think of a good reason for it - for now anyway . my number if anything happens . whats your sisters number ?	oh , i ... she just moved . ive got her new ... its in my book in the kitchen . wait ... thank you .
and you better stop greeting strangers with a shotgun . if leons austrian was looking for you i reckon hed have found you before i did .	im sorry . its just you dont look local ...
no sick people in the country , huh ? ... just tell me one thing , rhian . leons story about the boy ? you just took his word for it ?	hed come prepared . he had something besides shiva ... sleeping beauty . the disney film ... well , it looked like the disney film . it was something else . i couldnt watch ...
whats the date ?	the nineteenth ... how come you didnt know ?
ive been away . did leon speak to you about his sister ?	er ... yes ...
did he ever refer to the hostility between them ?	he ... apparently the hostility was all hers . leon didnt ... it hurt him . they used to be close ... their parents were in their forties when they were born , you see . and mostly away . they grew up in a scottish mansion with old nannies and servants . he ... our world was so old and cold , we shone for one another , leon used to say . his sister cut him off after she got married . he never understood why but thought it was because she had no children . was bitter ...
the money leon left for the boy , was it cash ?	yes . three thousand pounds . i still ...
did he mention anything about having an exhibition of his work ?	... no .
you sure ? what about before he turned up with the boy ?	... no . in fact , id seen him a couple of months earlier . he was quite depressed . his work wasnt getting anywhere . he said he was going to try something new , realism , london in the nineties - documentary stuff , you know ...
he showed me a book with a picture of a couple caught kissing in a street ...	hows the boy doing ?
fine ...	good . you neednt worry about the austrian anymore . hes dead . ill be in touch .
and you aint neither one of those damned mexicans who end up littering the landscape after getting ripped-off by their friendly cross- border guides , are you , mister ?	no ...
now , can you stand up ? can you use your legs and stand up ?	i ... how long have i been here ?
huh ... i guess you aint quite ready for civilisation yet ... ill give you one more day , a meal , and then youre on your way .	los angeles ?
los angeles is 100 miles away .	id appreciate it if i could use your phone .
barstows 30 miles to the left . los angeles a hundred to the right . wherever youre heading , i reckon somebodyll pick you up .	huh ... i suppose the idea of a one day trip to los angeles doesnt appeal to you ...
welcome to the club .	excuse me ?
i hear youre looking for leon . that makes me , his old-lady , and now you , looking for the little bastard . leons gone , man . vanished . you interested in his photographs ?	uh-huh .
no shit ... well , im afraid i cant help you .	i take it you dont know where he is , then ?
huh ! you could always try suicide bridge . you dont know leon , do you ?	i know his work better than i know him .
let me put it this way then ; the photographs and the man ? one and the same , man , one and the same . at best fucking weird , at worst fucked-up fucking weird . maybe you should think yourself lucky . some folks just aint worth getting involved with . and leon sure is one of em .	what about his girlfriend ?
what about which girlfriend ?	small , blond , good-looking . she was with him when we met . she had a funny english accent .
oh . thatd be rhian , a welsh chick he used to lay at weekends . she got wise and dumped him months ago ...	would you know where i might reach her ?
yeah ! somewhere in wales . i dont really know her . used to turn up in a transit van on weekends , sell old furniture at camden . thats how come he only laid her at weekends , ha ha ...	could that be camden market ?
yeah . why ? youre going to look for her ... shit ! you really think his pictures are that good ?	fucked-up fucking weird .
quest-ce que tu veux ?	un autrichien . negociant en pr- pubescents .
whats an hour of your time worth these days , nathalie ? combien , nathalie !	cinq cents .
jai bien peur quil te faudra attendre . pas avant la matine .	tu sais o me trouver .
bye . and thanks ... nathalie gently closes the door , eyes lombard who shakes himself awake ... rolls her eyes and surveys the room ...	o est pass ton salon ?
mon bureau cotait trop cher .	eh bien ... tes sr que tas besoin de moi ? la petite ma lair assez bien foutue , non ?
alors ?	alors quoi ?
le montage , lemballage . not your regular street muck , is it ? this is collectors stuff . how much would it cost me ?	a lachat , trois ou quatre mille . en location , cinq cent . mais a pourrait faire plus . je ne sais pas . cest pas vraiment mon truc . i dont know any austrian , xavier .
but maybe you know someone who does . an austrian , in london , dealing in kids and snuff videos . how many can there be ? these people supply to order . he has to be known , reachable .	then why dont you reach him ?
we are so alike , xavier . still , sometimes i wonder which one of us is the ugliest .	if you can , send me a receipt .
okay , shitbag . im only going to ask you this once . where is friedman ?	who ? i dont know who the fuck youre talking about , sunshine .
gluck .	figlio di puttana . youre the french asshole who bumped off the london guys ...
five seconds . then you die .	fuck ...
three ...	glucks dead , you sonofabitch !
youre the lantern man , huh ? if you wan na see whats left of him ...	the acid bath ?
why did you kill friedman ?	let me give you a tip , asshole - no one pulls stunts like what you pulled in london and here tonight and hopes to get away with it . it upsets people . its wrong . fucking wrong .
why did you kill him ?	huh ! you turned him into a liability , didnt you know ?
nice way to help a colleague in trouble .	thats just it . the sonofabitch didnt ask for help from his colleagues ... testa di cazzo ! hiring some amateur outsiders to fix you ... he hasnt gone to hell too soon ... and neither will you , mr lamont !
are you telling me friedman didnt tell you i was here looking for him ?	if he had , youd be dead .
so why didnt he ?	what do you think , huh ?
i think youd rather not know what i think .	huh . maybe he figured the news our london bureau got a visit from a hitman on behalf of a pissed off client wouldnt go down too well . he only shared his guilty secret last night . and then only cause he was so fucking edgy after calling his hotel we persuaded him to talk .
so you killed him and went to clean out his hotel room ... how did friedman say he got to know where to find me ?	thats the beauty . an anonymous call . makes you wonder how many people know what youre up to , eh , french-fuck ?
try again , and this time be polite .	i can only tell you what he told us ...
not even scum like friedman would go to the trouble of killing a stranger on the strength of one anonymous call .	some guy called to let him know the frenchman whod called the night before he left london was in l.a. looking to kill him . he did his sums and decided to take the call seriously .
what sums ?	two stiffs and a missing kid followed your visit to one of the london hotels . he didnt need your confession ...
youre sure he said his caller was a man ?	thats what he said ...
when they realise im missing ...	shut up and walk ...
what you gon na do ? kill me ?	dont tempt me . the last scumbag who thought i might kill him died soon afterwards .
moreau ? cest moi . alors ...	salut , laurent . ouais . it wasnt easy but i got what you wanted through interpol . say , whats your business with these spitzes ?
they lost their son . why ?	it appears that in their younger days they were actively involved with a shady german group of nazi hunters known as never forget . over the years were talking about a dozen or so execution-type killings .
are they still operative ?	their last suspected kill occurred two years back , though your spitzes now probably do no more than bankroll the group . still , id watch my step . these people are well-connected , laurent ; former israeli prime minister , etc . the ladys also president of an international zionist organisation ... anyway , you get the picture .
mossad ?	its a good guess ...
ha ha ... yes . with prices reaching an all time low , the name of the game has become have-it- where-its-at ... as we all know , transportation has always been the costliest and trickiest part of this business ...	cost what ?
costliest !	whats that ? a word ?
what do you think ?	i dont know . could be the sound of jewellery hitting a parquet floor , huh ?
very funny . can i go on now ?	sure . but speak english , will ya , ha ha ...
oh dear , why is life so complicated ? sometimes i really wish i could be someone else .	that 's a good idea , sire .
what do you mean ?	let someone else pretend to be you , and see if ...
why not you -- jean d'aulon ? the only man who 's poorer than i am , and so the only man i can trust . dignified , honorable , wise ... what more could we ask of a king ?	my lord , i 'm not sure that ...
my dear aulon , to you it shall befall the honor of impersonating the royal blood !	majesty , i ca n't ...
why , are you not ready to die for your king ?	of course i am , it 's just that ...
sire , you know how bad i am at this sort of game .	so ... pretend it 's not a game .
jeanne , this is -- in fact -- my loyal friend and finest archer , jean d'aulon . jean ... i place her in your care . find her suitable lodgings -- here -- in the castle ... and guard her with your life .	yes , my lord .
here ... to help pay jeanne 's ransom . all the captains gave what they could , as well as the citizens of orleans and the other towns she saved ...	very generous of you all . how much ?
my dear aulon ... that 's fine ...	jeanne 's been badly injured ! she jumped from the top of a tower into a frozen moat !
it 's a miracle she 's not dead !	we have to do something before she tries it again ! i beg of you , my lord , do n't let her down ... let me organize an escape ...
jean , it 's ... it 's not so easy ...	but not impossible ... gilles and la hire are ready to risk everything to save her ...
jean ... me dear , loyal jean ... why do you want to oppose the will of god ? jeanne wanted to go to compiegne -- we let her -- she got caught . then , on my personal orders , regnault proposed 30,000 crowns for her ransom , and once again the answer was no . and now you say she tried to escape , and the answer is still no . jean , open your eyes -- ca n't you see the hand of god in all this ?	no . i see the hand of tremoille , and regnault , and yolande , and you ... and they are dirty hands .
what do you fear most now ... my sword ? ... or his hands ?	tremoille ... do n't . please ...
listen , please accept my apologies for ... you know , me pretending to be the ... well it was n't really my idea ... well , yes it was my idea but ...	do you think i could have some water ?
i would like some fresh straw .	louis ... water and fresh straw !
and i would like to see a priest .	now ?
yes . i did n't confess today .	right . raymond ... a priest .
i shall also be needing a war horse -- mine is too slow -- and armor -- and a good sword -- and an artist to make me a banner .	now ?
better today than tomorrow .	well ... uh -- this might take a little time -- but let me see what i can do .
i also need someone who can read and write .	this i can do . i was studying at the university of paris -- till the english invaded it .
i thought you were an archer ?	yes , i am . i 'm an archer who can read and write . who do you want to write to ?
who do they think i am ? !	jeanne , calm down . you ca n't blame the people -- they 've been hearing all about you for weeks .
jeanne , stop it !	how dare you stop me doing god 's will !
he did n't tell you to cut all your hair off ... !	how dare you tell me what god tells me to do !
what did they say ?	uh ... they said ... they will think about it .
good .	but ... to be honest ... i do n't think they 'll leave tomorrow .
what 's going on ? !	they 've started the battle without me !
not so ... easily . why are n't you ... fighting ... ? go on ... we 're almost there ...	jeanne , you 've been badly wounded ...
alright ... i promise to rest if you promise ... to go back to the battle .	i promise ...
the king said you 're his finest archer ... ?	well ...
jeanne , calm down , do you hear me ? are you alright ?	yes ...
i 'll go .	jeanne , no ...
jeanne ... ! are you alright ?	yes . yes , i 'm fine ... we need more brushwood ! why are you staring at me like that ?
jeanne ... the king has ordered us not to ride with you anymore .	so ... what am i supposed to do now ?
they 've abandoned me ... like everyone .	what ... what do you mean ?
it 's been weeks since they spoke to me . since the coronation ... no signs ... nothing ...	maybe their silence is a sign ... ? maybe it 's a sign to go home ?
it 's not time yet . my mission is not over yet . there is still more i must do before i can really -- finally -- go home .	but how do you know that these -- these voices are n't really just -- well , you .
well of course they 're me ! that 's how god talks to me . if you listen hard enough , even you can hear him . everyone can hear him .	but i hear so many voices ... one voice saying one thing , another voice saying the opposite -- love your enemy , kill your enemy -- what is good , what is evil ... ?
all you have to do is stop talking and just listen .	but how do you know what you hear is the truth ?
i do n't know it . i feel it .	you make it sound so simple ...
the truth is always simple ... it 's you , jean , who 's making things complicated .	me ? ! it 's not me , it 's god who makes everything complicated ! if he 's all-powerful , why not let the english stay on their island in the first place ? and why let this war go on for a hundred years ? and why send you out to fight when a girl like you should be at home with your family ? why , why ? !
so ... even you do n't believe in me anymore ...	jeanne ... i believe in you ... more than anyone ...
if you really want to help me , there 's one thing you can do .	tell me ...
that 's not what i asked ... why do you want to marry me ?	you listen to your voices , i listen to my heart .
what did the king say ?	he said that ... he 's making a treaty with the duke of burgundy and ...
it 's a trap ! they 're buying time till they can bring over more soldiers from england !	did your voices tell you that ? you told me you had n't heard them for months ...
no , but ...	or maybe it 's jeanne who 's in a trap -- her own trap -- a downward spiral that she ca n't stop ?
did you come back to marry me or to insult me ?	to marry you .
i will ask my voices ... if they come back one day . meanwhile ... i 'm going to compiegne .	jeanne ... i have been hearing voices -- and believe me , those voices left me in no doubt that you must not go to compiegne !
jeanne ... i believe in you -- but can you believe in me for once ? do n't go ... even if you do n't want to marry me .	i would like to marry you . but i have already promised myself ... to god .
but ... you 've done so much for god as it is ... ca n't you do something for yourself for once -- for jeanne ?	but it is what i want .
to be killed in battle ?	if god wants me to win , he will find a way . and if he wants me to die ... if he wants me back ... then that 's fine too . then i 'll be with him forever .
will you at least let me stay with you ?	it would not be the same without you .
we must sound the retreat !	not yet !
get back inside the town and see if the english are attacking from the other side !	but ... why ... what 's the point ?
do as i say !	i want to stay with you ...
i am ready now ...	just give me a moment and then you 'll be free ...
i 'm already free ...	yes yes ... any moment ... you 're always so impatient ...
my gentle captain ... i 'm staying .	i -- i do n't understand ...
one day you will .	you do n't know what you 're saying . you 're going to leave this place , jeanne -- you 're going home -- or whatever you want -- you 're going to be happy , and have children , and ...
... and maybe the king will give you some money , and a little land , and a title even ... ... would n't that be a fine thing ? you , a lady of title !	i 'm staying , jean .
no , you must come , jeanne -- we need you -- so much has happened since you left ... i have a new horse now , a white one , just like yours ... and la hire hardly swears at all anymore ... you ca n't stay -- they 'll burn you !	i 'm not afraid of the fire anymore . it will purify me ...
jeanne 's alive !	good .
we have to press home the attack !	sound the retreat ...
but i promised jeanne we 'd fight on !	i made no such promise . sound the retreat for the night !
but that was her order !	i 'm fed up with taking her orders . she swore she 'd defeat the english before nightfall , instead of which she goes and plays the fool and gets herself nearly killed ! look at the mess we 're in ! that 's her mess , not mine ... ! we 're worse off then if she 'd never come at all ! ... now do as i say and sound the retreat !
i wo n't tell you more about that . i 'm more afraid of displeasing him than not answering you ...	you 're afraid of displeasing god when telling the truth ? !
no ...	did god forbid you to tell the truth ?
go onto the next question .	good advice for the french , not for the english ! do you think god hates the english ?
is it true that you launched an attack on paris ?	i tried to .
it was on a sunday , was n't it ?	i do n't remember . maybe .
do you think is was a good idea to launch an attack on a holy day ?	i do n't know ...
and did n't you order the citizens of paris to surrender the city in the name of the king of heaven ?	no ... i said `` surrender in the name of the king of france '' ...
i ca n't read .	ah , yes , i forgot ... god sent us an illiterate peasant to carry out such an important mission ! do you think that god made the right decision , to take an ignorant girl to save the kingdom of france ?
do you have a sword ?	quite a few .
did n't you also carry a banner ?	yes ...
which did you prefer , your banner or your sword ?	i was forty times more fond of my banner than my sword .
and why was that ? did it have some particular value or power ?	no , it 's just ... a sword is a weapon .
and ?	and so i ... i prefer my banner .
why ?	to avoid killing anyone .
no , of course not ... i never killed anyone ...	then perhaps the temptation to kill would have been stronger ... too strong perhaps ... ?
no ! i warned the english to go back home -- i begged them not to force us to fight -- they knew the defeat i would bring on them ... why did n't they listen to me ?	we have numerous witnesses who can confirm that you were not always carrying your banner ...
yes , probably ... maybe ...	so sometimes you were carrying just your sword ?
yes , but ...	did you use the sword that you held in your hand ?
no , i ... i held it up to ...	you held up your sword and flourished it about in the air ? like this ?
yes , maybe ... i do n't remember ...	... so you were in the middle of the battlefield , with your sword in your hand , waving it above your head ... charging against the enemy , screaming and yelling ... fighting for your life ... and you want us to believe that in the middle of all this excitement you never killed anyone ?
it is the sacred place that matters , charles -- not the size . am i correct , bishop ?	oh yes , my lady . all true kings of france must first be anointed in our great cathedral of rheims ... with the holy oil of clovis ... for it was within these very walls that saint remy received the sacred oil from heaven , brought to him by a white dove for the anointing of king clovis ...
i do n't understand ... the holy oil of clovis ... it was quite full the last time i saw it ...	and when was that ?
well ... at the coronation of king charles vi ...	thirty years ago ? i 'm not surprised it 's gone ...
w-w-what are you doing ? !	performing a miracle .
arrest them !	what are you doing ? this is an ecclesiastical court -- you have no right to do this !
who 's running this trial , you or her ? i ca n't believe it ! this wretched girl -- how dare she speak to us like that ?	she 's loyal to her king ... it 's only to be expected that she ...
i understand your impatience , but if you want this trial to be acknowledged as legal we must follow correct procedure and ...	to hell with procedure ! we paid a bloody fortune for this slut , and we can do whatever the hell we like with her , whether the church likes it or not -- is that clear ?
but if this trial seems fixed , i fear you 'll have the very opposite result to the one you want ...	we want her burned as a witch !
but in order to do so , the church must first prove her heresy , or else you 'll be burning a martyr ...	well then ? start proving ... or else the church will have another martyr !
calm down , my lord , i beg you !	how can i calm down when i 'm made the laughing-stock of the whole court ? ! i 've had enough !
be patient , my lord ... you 've seen how it is . this girl has a way with people ... but everyday we 're making progress ...	so long as this bitch remains alive , our armies refuse to fight ! do n't you understand ? they want proof that god is on their side ... and the only way they 're going to believe that is when they see her being burnt as a witch !
it is not for us to burn her , my lord . that is your prerogative .	... and your prerogative is to find her guilty ...
but we ca n't do that unless she admits to blasphemy ...	well what are you waiting for ? you 've got a castle full of racks and ropes and pulleys : go and torture the bitch !
you wo n't be able to drag anything from her that way . you also must realize that many of my colleagues are ... well , scared ...	scared of a girl ?
whose side are you on , cauchon ?	i 'm on the side of our mother holy church . besides , a confession under torture will never convince anyone of her guilt .
so ... here is the famous jeanne ... savior of orleans ... terror of the english ? you look pretty ordinary to me ...	am i ... am i dead ?
dead you 're worthless , darling .	where ... where am i ?
my king will pay any ransom you ask .	your king ? ah yes , of course ... what 's he going to pay me with ? cows ? chickens ? i prefer gold , and the english have plenty . i wonder how much they 'll pay ... to have the witch of orleans in their clutches ? those english are so arrogant , they ca n't accept the idea of being defeated by a peasant girl ... it has to have been the devil 's work .
god defeated the english , not me .	and god who allowed you to be caught ?
are you alright ? did they hurt you ?	no no , i 'm fine , really ...
really ?	i was talking to the priest , and do you know what he said to me ?
quick -- hide in here ...	what about you ?
do n't worry about me -- just stay in here ... and do n't move !	but where are you going to be ?
oh , thank you lord ! i 'm so glad to see you ! i need to confess ... i have n't been confessed since easter ... or been to mass ... will you hear me now ?	i will hear you ... but not now , not here .
who are you ?	pierre cauchon , bishop of beauvais . as you were captured in my diocese , the duty of conducting the trial falls upon me .
trial ? what trial ? ?	your trial , jeanne . on a charge of heresy .
but ... the king -- my king -- did n't he pay my ransom ?	it seems that the english care more about you than the french .
the english ? ?	yes . they paid your ransom ... tomorrow you will be transferred to their great castle at rouen .
take the holy gospels in your hand and swear to tell the whole truth concerning everything you will be asked .	i do n't know what you 're going to ask me questions about . you may ask things that i wo n't want to answer .
you will swear to tell the truth about whatever you are asked .	i will willingly swear to tell the truth about earthly things , but as for my revelations , i 've never told anyone except my king ... charles the seventh ... the one and only king of france .
you must take the oath ! not even a king , would refuse to take an oath to tell the truth in a matter of faith .	i will willingly swear to tell you what i am allowed to tell you , but as to the rest , even if you threaten to cut off my head , i still wo n't tell you .
so ... begin by telling us your name -- assuming you 're allowed to tell us that much ?	my name is jeanne . my little cross i had round my neck was taken away from me . i would like to have it back .
show us a little more cooperation first . where were you born ?	in a village called domremy .
how old are you ?	nineteen ... or thereabouts ...
were you baptized ?	yes . in the church at domremy .
recite the lord 's prayer .	not unless you hear my confession .
jeanne , listen to me very carefully . we are all men of faith , and we shall earnestly strive for the salvation of both your soul and body as though it were our own . we do so in the name of our holy mother church , who never closes her arms to those who would return to her . but we can not help you unless you submit to our learned judgment and authority . take heed of this charitable admonition , for if you persist in refusing our help , then we shall have no choice but to abandon you to the secular powers , and i think you know well enough the punishment that would await you . so now ... will you please recite our lord 's prayer ?	not unless you hear my confession .
jeanne -- be careful -- you 're not helping yourself by refusing to submit to our judgment ...	and you be careful , you who claim to be my judges , for you too will be judged one day ... !
jeanne , you are not helping yourself . if you do n't answer our questions properly , your refusal will be taken into account .	these questions have nothing to do with your trial .
i assure you they do . so ... answer me ... when was the last time you heard this voice ?	not long ago ...
when exactly ? a day , a week -- when ?	last night .
what were you doing when the voice came ?	praying .
the voice was in your cell ?	yes .
what did it tell you ?	many things ...
tell us , jeanne ... do you often hear this voice ?	yes ...
let me clarify things for you , jeanne . on the one hand there is the church triumphant , that is to say god , his saints , and the souls that are saved . and then there is the church militant , that is to say our holy father the pope , the cardinals , the prelates of the church , the clergy , and all good catholic christians . moreover this church , when assembled , is guided by the holy spirit and therefore can not be in error . that is why we ask you to submit to the church militant ... that is to say , us .	so it is the church militant that refuses to confess me , and so prevents me from being a good christian ?
it is for us to determine whether you are a good christian , not you .	i am sent by god , and i submit all my words and deeds to his judgment . or do you think that you are better judges than he is ?
jeanne , i beg of you ... sign ! in god 's name , do n't you understand ? i 'm trying to save you ! if you do n't sign , the english will burn you to death ! is that what you want ? ?	no ... i want to be confessed .
sign this , and i will confess you myself if you want .	and may i go to mass ?
please ... may i have it back ...	you have nothing to regret ...
i did n't mean it ! i did n't know what i was signing ! you tricked me ... !	silence her ! take her away ... !
i do n't understand , jeanne ... why did you do it ? why ?	and you ? why did you lie ? you promised i could be confessed ...
i know , jeanne ... it was the only way to save you from the fire !	it 's not my body i want to save . it 's my soul .
i ask only one thing ... to hear me in confession ...	i -- i ca n't jeanne ... i ca n't hear your confession ... i 'm sorry ...
good day , sir . i trust my honorable duke of burgundy is feeling well ?	he 's feeling wonderful .
thanks be to god .	and your duke ? the duke of bedford ?
not so well , i regret to say . this business with the maiden ... it 's caused him endless grief and torment . that 's why he 's entrusted me with the task of ... shall we say ...	buying her ?
this word is -- regrettably appropriate for the situation . in fact what we -- the church -- wish to do is determine whether or not this girl is sent by god , as she claims . you understand that we can not allow just anybody to abuse god 's name in this manner ...	i understand . how much ?
20,000 ? ! but ... i heard king charles was ... financially embarrassed .	do n't look at the cost , look at what it brings . what is your last offer ?
your health and happiness has always been my first concern , charles ... ever since you were a little boy -- and i think i know you better than your own mother ...	you think ?
mmmm . yes . i know for example the sickness that plagues your heart . i know how painful it is for you ... to have loved a father ... without ever knowing if he really was yours .	w-w-what has that got to do with this maiden ?
who better than a messenger from god to give answers to your questions ?	you really think she 's been sent ... by god ?
you will ? ?	for the sake of france , charles . and for the sake of my grandson .
it 's true . there 's only one king ... people need to be reminded of that . nevertheless ... jeanne has done so much for us ...	i assure you , charles , the maiden has no greater admirer than myself . but whatever our personal feelings , we can not allow her to conduct her own private war . for the sake of the kingdom , it is imperative that you stop her going to compiegne ...
do n't worry , charles . if god is still with her , she will be victorious . we 're not her judges ... we 're just spectators . let her go to compiegne , as you let her go to orleans , and let god decide her fate .	but ... her army 's so small now ...
there 's no need to be afraid , sire .	i 'm ... i 'm not the king ...
what was my mission ? to help my country ? but how could i do that ? i was only a poor girl who knew nothing about riding or making war ... so i decided to wait and not to speak to anyone about it .	you did well ...
... and what ... what did he say ?	he said that i have to save france from her enemies and give her back to god , and he told me that i -- jeanne -- will lead you to the altar at rheims to be crowned king of france .
i do n't need lodgings if we 're to be marching on orleans ...	orleans has held out for six months . i do n't suppose a few days will make much difference . take some rest .
ah , jeanne ... come here ... ! this whole coronation idea of yours is a fiasco ... nothing is ready ...	... you look wonderful ...
get them out of here !	now hold on -- you 're not captain here ... on the battlefield perhaps , but not in the royal bedchamber !
why did you betray me ? paris was ours for the taking ! all i needed was another few hundred men ... why did you take back the army you gave me ?	gave you ? well now , i would n't quite put it like that ...
so how would you put it ?	well ... we are , of course , enormously grateful for your past efforts , but your task is done . now it 's time for negotiation ... and after many months of skillful work , our dear tremoille is about to seal a treaty with our burgundian friends who will no longer lend their support to the english . you see , my dear jeanne ... as it is written in the bible , `` to everything there is a season : a time for war , and a time for peace '' ...
peace will only be got from the english at the end of a lance !	why do you have to be so bloodthirsty ? do you enjoy it ? all that blood and noise and pain ? diplomacy is far more civilized ... far safer ... and far cheaper ...
she pretends she 's been sent by god ! these charlatans -- it 's a pity there is n't enough wood to burn them all !	she says she 'll be here tomorrow ... !
you must n't see her , my lord . we know nothing about her ... we do n't even know if she is from lorraine .	what difference does it make where she comes from ?
not exactly . she wants you to give her an army -- at your expanse . bearing in mind that your mother stole every last piece of gold in the treasury , i fail to see how you can afford such an adventure .	i can see her if i want to . i mean , with half of france in the hands of the english , what have i got to lose ?
your majesty , i urge you not to see this woman . it all reeks of a burgundian trap !	my astrologers assure me that the hour is p-p-propitious -- leo , with virgo rising . have you ever noticed on the astrological chart how the virgin is next to the lion ?
supposing she 's an assassin ?	tremoille , i 'm not even king yet ... who 'd want to assassinate me ?
your majesty , i really think you ...	my dear loyal tremoille , i know i can count on you ...
... as always , majesty ...	... to ensure our privacy . i need to talk to her . alone .
my captains have sworn their support .	no doubt your captains will fight for your fine cause -- but what about the ordinary soldier ? they do n't fight for causes these days . they fight for money . who 's going to pay them ?
he 's probably right -- let 's call a delay ...	there 's no time , sire -- we ca n't hold up the ceremony ... there 's no telling when the english might come back ... they 're only ten leagues away ...
i ... i do n't know ... it 'll sound like we ... betrayed her ... ?	noooo !
when you saw your king for the first time , was there an angel over his head ?	if there was , i did n't see it ...
then why did your king believe in you without any proof ?	go and ask him yourself .
you told us about the appearance of this ... voice . what exactly did you see ? part of it ... or all of it ?	his face .
does he have hair ?	yes .
is it long and hanging down ?	i 'm more interested in what he says , not what he looks like .
but if the devil were to take on the physical appearance of a saint or an angel ... or a man ... how would you recognize him ? by what he said ?	go on to the next question .
5,000 gold crowns .	that 's not a lot .
it is all his majesty can afford . he has even donated his very own personal savings . his majesty will greatly appreciate a gesture of good will in this delicate negotiation between our two families .	i know ... but the english want her very badly , and i have to tell you that they are proving much more generous .
may i , without offending you , inquire how generous ?	20,000 gold crowns .
8,000. we ca n't raise more ... we can only place ourselves at the mercy of your generosity .	i must offer to the duke . i will give you his answer tomorrow .
were you sent by lord dunois ?	yes ... they were .
good . where are the english ?	everywhere . where is the food ?
it 's coming -- i rode on ahead . i have to speak with the captain of the english army ... his name 's talbot ...	i know ...
good . can you bring me to him ?	he 's on the other side of the river .
wait , wait ...	for what ?
because ... because -- i mean -- the english have a broad sense of humor , but ... i mean , you do n't understand ... to them you 're a witch , working for the devil . what makes you think they 'll listen to you ?	because if they do n't , i 'll raise such a war-cry against them that they will remember us forever !
well . i 'd love to see that , but after taking counsel with my captains , i felt it would be better to first bring the food into the city , then wait till alencon arrives with reinforcements before doing anything .	you may have been with your counsel , but i 've been with mine , and i 'm telling you , god 's counsel is wiser than yours , and he 's telling me to speak to the english -- now !
so ... what is the message ?	we offer the english a last chance to return home in peace . if they refuse , we recross the river and attack them here -- at the tourelles .
jeanne , that really makes no sense at all . the tourelles is virtually impregnable ... besides , if we 're on the other side of the river attacking the tourelles , what 's to stop talbot attacking the city from the north ?	god .
you know , i feel a great sorrow for you , because you 're laughing now , but by tomorrow night some of you will be dead and having to repeat your jokes in front of god .	jeanne , with respect -- we ca n't just attack the tourelles like that -- it 's a very complicated matter and ...
`` be patient , be patient '' ... is that the only advice you can ever come up with ? ? i 've shown more patience than a dozen saints !	jeanne , you have to understand -- it 's not easy for us -- i mean for our pride -- to suddenly be usurped by a -- well , with all due respect , by a ... girl .
ah , so that 's it . to you i 'm just a girl .	jeanne , put yourself in my shoes for a moment -- how would you feel , if you were me ?
dunois ... was it you who ordered the attack ? answer me ? !	can we -- uh -- discuss this later ?
position the long-bows over there , crossbows over there -- and set up dijon culverins either side of those trees ...	the wind will be against us ...
what 's going on ?	we 're taking back the tourelles !
jeanne , what are you doing with that ... you 've got it back to front ...	i know what i 'm doing , so either lend a hand or go back to bed !
stand by with the battering-rams ...	we need another ten minutes ...
well ... ? shall we go ?	not yet .
my lord dunois ... i have wonderful news ! -- finally -- he 's sending her to us -- thanks be to god -- we 're saved -- it 's wonderful !	calm yourself , xaintrailles . now slowly . who has finally done what ?
the dauphin -- he 's sending us food -- and supplies -- and an army -- led by jeanne -- the maiden from lorraine -- is n't it wonderful ? !	yes , it 's a miracle .
and it 's not the first one ! they say she saved a little boy who was dying of ...	xaintrailles ... ! do n't talk to me about miracles ... if i was still sitting there waiting for a miracle , i 'd be dead now . anyway ...
but ... do n't you think we should at least ... go and ... welcome her ?	as long as she brings food and supplies , she 'll be welcome .
brilliant idea ... but to be really effective , why not send a whole army of virgins ?	that 'll put fire in my soldiers !
god ... why of course -- we 'd forgotten about him ! strange , i do n't seem to remember seeing him at agincourt .	damn right !
i do love her when her fire gets well and truly stoked !	me too ...
there must be something we can do for her for chrissakes !	yes . we can pray .
this is no good !	no good ? this is a disaster !
and ... what does jeanne think ?	i do n't think . i leave that to god . i 'm nothing in all this , i 'm just the messenger .
we return to orleans ... across the bridge , at the tourelles .	but the bridge has been pulled down !
clear ?	perfectly .
you look disappointed ... is n't this what you wanted ?	no ... not like this ...
jeanne ... let him do it . one more dead body 's not going to make any difference , so who cares ?	i care ! and i care because god cares ! all life is precious to god -- even his -- even yours and mine ...
bravo ! what about all the other hundreds of prisoners ? do we let them go too ?	maybe ... i do n't know ... but first we have to confess ...
jeanne ... the men are exhausted !	i know , but so is the enemy -- they 're falling back -- paris is ours ... !
jeanne ... we 're not enough ...	so ... bring up the reinforcements !
right behind us -- dunois with another then thousand men !	jeanne , look behind you .
do you know how to count ?	of course i do ? bring them up !
jeanne ... that is not ten thousand reinforcements -- that is one hundred very loyal but very tired soldiers .	but ... where is dunois ... where are the men the king promised me ?
he never sent them ... do n't you understand ? he does n't want this war anymore ... he has his crown now , that 's all he ever wanted ...	but my voices ... they promised me ...
who told you to wear men 's clothes ?	the clothes are not important ...
you also cut your hair short like a man , and in the bible it clearly states that it is an abomination for a woman to pretend to be a man ! it proves your desire to deceive ...	it was just ... more convenient as i was among soldiers ...
so you think you did well to cut your hair and dress as a man ?	i ... submit to our lord .
but will you also submit to the decision of the church ?	it seems to me that the church and our lord are one and the same . why must you complicate what is so simple ?
tell us , jeanne ... why did you jump from the tower at beaurevoir ?	i had been sold to the english . i 'd rather die than fall into their hands .
did your voice tell you to jump ?	no ...
so when you jumped , you wanted to kill yourself ?	no ... !
how can you deny it when you just said `` i 'd rather die than fall into the hands of the english '' ... ?	that 's now what i meant ...
do you not know that suicide is a very grievous sin ? no one is allowed to destroy the life that god created !	i know , but that 's not the way things happened ...
you mean it was not of your own free will that you were on the ledge ?	yes , but ...
and you did n't jump of your free will ?	no !
stop it ! what are you doing ?	nothing ... just taking his teeth .
but you ca n't just kill a man for his teeth !	why not ? he has good teeth ...
besides , what about these ... ?	that 's different ... i mean ... we were fighting for a ... for a cause !
yeah ...	here -- take this instead .
so who gave the order to bring me to this side of the river ? ?	hey , my friend ! i 'm glad to see your ugly damn face again !
la hire , i 'm warning you -- do n't swear !	sorry jeanne ... did you both meet already ?
jeanne , let me introduce the king 's half brother , the dogged lord dunois .	then , lord dunois , show me the way to the other side of the river ...
jesus christ ... the goddamn english will pay for this !	they will -- and so will you if you go on swearing like that .
what happened ? who gave the order to attack ?	god knows , but it was a bad idea !
i swear i 'll never swear again in my life if you save her life ! but i 'm warning you , if you let her die , then you 're the biggest ...	do n't swear ...
physicians are a waste of time . you 'll have more luck with this charm of mine ... it saved my life at agincourt !	i 'd sooner die than use magic !
prepare these as battering-rams !	what 's the use ? the drawbridge is up !
we ... won ? !	won ? ! such a small word will never do ! this is victory , jeanne , this is ... glory !
you call this ... glory ... ? all this ... this blood ... this smell of ...	... the smell of victory , jeanne ! mmmmmmm ! i love it !
take mine instead -- here -- smash mine first !	jeanne ... get up ... this is ridiculous ...
jeanne ... the man has n't been paid for six months -- that 's his only reward . let him take a few teeth ...	a few teeth ... that 's the price of his life ?
jeanne , if you do n't mind ... i 'll stay standing ... this armor ... it 's a nightmare to get back up ...	i said , kneel !
you do n't believe me anymore ?	we still believe in you , jeanne . if it were up to me , i 'd chase every goddamn englishman into the ocean . but it 's not up to us anymore -- it 's up to the king ...
when you were taken prisoner at compiegne , did you have a horse ?	yes ... a half-steed ... white .
who gave you that horse ?	my king .
how many did he give you ?	five steeds and a few hackneys ...
as much as for a lord ? what an honor ! did your king give you other wealth apart from horses ?	no .
what about all those dresses you were given ... silk dresses were n't they ?	yes , i was given a few , but i never had time to wear them ...
still , pretty wealthy for a peasant girl would n't you say ?	and you look pretty wealthy for a servant of god , would n't you say ?
jeanne ... what are you doing ?	playing ...
what have you done to me ?	i -- i -- i ...
who ... who are you ... ?	i am that i am . you do n't like my face ? maybe you prefer this one ...
who are you to even think you can know the difference between good and evil ? are you god ?	no ... no ... i 'm just a messenger ... he needs me ... a higher calling ...
i do n't know ... i thought ...	you think god is n't big enough to deliver his own messages ?
i do n't know ... please ... tell me i 'm dead ...	who are you to decide if you should live or die ?
i ... do n't know ... what do you want from me ?	nothing . i 'm here to set you free ...
what are you doing out here ?	i might ask you the same question .
i ... i 'm leaving ... i ca n't take anymore ...	and what exactly is it that you ca n't take anymore of ?
everything ! prison -- humiliation -- being abandoned and betrayed by everyone -- i ca n't stand it anymore -- i 'd rather die !	you 'll be dead soon enough anyway , so why be in such a hurry ? why not face up to your lies ? it 's your lies you ca n't stand anymore ...
i ... i never lied !	if you were true to yourself ... if your faith was firm , you would n't need to run away from yourself like this ...
i am true -- to my lord , the king of heaven . he knows how much i love him -- that 's all that matters to me ...	how can you pretend that you love god when you 're about to throw away the most precious thing he gave you ? life is a gift , you should know that by now jeanne -- a gift from god . you know what he 'd say to you , if he was here ? `` what are you doing to me , jeanne ? ''
that 's too easy . one minute you want to die , the next you want to live ... do you think that life is a toy that can be played with and then broken when you do n't want it anymore ?	no , no ... i 'm just so tired , and lost , and ... i did n't realize what i was doing !
oh ? and just because you realize now , everybody else should forgive you ? !	i do n't know -- i do n't care anymore -- i just want to be at peace !
oh , so you do n't want war anymore ? you want to be at peace ? you want to be able to change your mind anytime you feel like it and expect everyone to go along with it ?	i do n't understand . what do you want from me ?
why were you yelling like that ? !	what are you doing here ? please ... leave ... you ca n't stay here ...
why ? are you waiting for someone else ?	yes !
my ... visions ...	they 're going to come and visit you in here ?
yes ... that 's what i pray for ... !	i want to see that . do you mind if i stay ... on the side ? i wo n't bother you .
no , no -- you ca n't stay or they wo n't come !	why not ?
they wo n't come anyway .	what do you mean , they wo n't come ?
why would they ?	because ! because i 've always been faithful to god , and i 've followed everything he said ... and i 've done everything he asked me ...
god asked you to do something ?	yes ... lots of things !
you mean god said , `` i need you , jeanne ? ''	no , but ... he sent me so many signs !
what signs ?	like ... like the wind ... and the clouds ... and ... the bells ... and what about that sword lying in the field ... that was a sign ... !
no . that was a sword in a field .	but ... it did n't just get there by itself .
i 'm not lying , i ... i ca n't remember ... leave me alone !	oh ? you ca n't remember ? let me help your memory ...
no ! i do n't want to know anymore ! leave me alone ! i did n't kill that man !	oh no ? how about this one ?
stop , stop ... i ca n't remember ! the battles were all so confusing ... there was so much smoke , dust , noise ... i was being attacked on all sides , so ... maybe ... perhaps i fought back but it was only to defend myself ...	so your memory 's coming back ?
yes ... yes ! and now you tell me why god let all these battles happen in the first place ... if he 's so powerful ... he said he 's `` the creator of heaven and earth , the source of all life ... '' he could have easily stopped all this blood and misery ? why did n't he ?	is he the one who spread all this blood and misery ?
no , but ... why did n't he stop it ? or did he get pleasure , watching us killing each other in his name ?	in his name ? ?
yes ! we fought and killed in his name ... the king of heaven !	really ?
`` let all who love me follow me '' ... where does god get mentioned ? come on jeanne , be honest . you fought for yourself , in your name .	i ... i was defending myself as best i could ! everyone has the right to defend themselves , do n't they ? or should i have let myself be killed ?
no , no , you did fine . i 'd even say well done . besides , most of the ones you killed probably deserved it , do n't you think ?	no , i do not think so . i do n't think that killing each other will ever bring peace .
i do n't agree . why do you have to keep changing your mind all the time ?	why are you doing this to me ? ? do you get pleasure from hurting me ?
ah , pleasure ... that 's a difficult word to define . when does the pain end and the pleasure begin ... ? when did your pleasure begin with that sword in your hand ... ?	i never took pleasure in hurting anyone ?
i -- i cleaned up my room , look ... and i said my prayers ... all of them ... and ...	what are you doing on the wall ?
i 'm trying to make my cross look more beautiful ...	what for ?
because ... because i do n't know what else to do to please him .	do you think this cross will protect you ?
`` love your enemies '' ...	good . but `` love your enemies '' ... body and soul .
my voices ... my voices ... do you think they will ever come back ?	i do n't think so .
are you going to leave me too ?	yes ... of course ... when you do n't need me anymore .
there 's nothing for me to do here anymore ... i do n't belong here i want to be with him now ...	do you think you are ready ?
yes i am .	are you willing to follow all his commandments ?
yes ...	... to love your enemy as much as you love yourself ?
you know what you just signed , jeanne ? you just signed away my existence ... for you i 'm a lie , an illusion . you see ? in the end , you were the one who abandoned me ...	no ...
you think you are ready now ?	yes , my lord .
you know i 'm always happy to see you , jeanne , but to keep coming here twice , three times a day ...	i need to confess .
but you already confessed this morning ...	i need to confess again .
i saw a poor monk without shoes so i gave him some .	there 's no sin in charity , jeanne .
they were n't my shoes . mine were too small .	whose were they ?
my father 's .	i 'm sure he 'll forgive you .
he already did , but i want god to forgive me too .	jeanne -- if we were to ask forgiveness all the time , we 'd spend our whole life in church .
is that bad ?	well no , but ... jeanne , are you happy at home ?
oh yes ... very .	and your mother -- everything 's fine with her ?
good , good . and your sister ... catherine -- she 's still your best friend ?	oh yes , my sister 's just ... she 's ... wonderful .
and what about your other friends ... you do n't like playing with them ?	oh yes , i play with them ... lots ...
so ... everything sounds ... wonderful ?	yes , it is .
then ... why are you here so often ?	i feel safe here . and it 's where i can talk to him .
him ?	well , i try and talk to him , but mostly he 's the one who does the talking .
who is this `` he '' ?	he never says his name .
beautiful .	and what does he say to you ?
he says ... he says i must be good ... and help everyone ... and take care of myself . do you think he 's coming from the sky ?	perhaps ... but wherever he comes from , i think you should listen to him , because it sounds like he 's giving you very good advice .
i heard about your sister , and i ... understand your pain ...	why did she have to die ?
only god knows the answer to that .	i know jesus says to love our enemies but i ca n't -- i just want the english to burn in hell for ever and ever !
i realize your anger , jeanne , but we must learn to forgive . it 's hard , but revenge will never bring about peace .	then what will ? and what will bring her back ? and why did she have to die in the first place instead of me ? why did n't he take my life instead of hers ? it was my fault -- i was late -- she gave me her hiding place ... ! !
i do n't want to wait for his call .	jeanne , be patient .
i want to be with him always ...	soon you 'll be able to take the holy mass , and as you eat of his flesh and drink of his blood , you will be at one with him .
i 'm sorry , mr wladek , he wants you to stop .	who wants me to stop ?
why are you here , mr. wladek ?	it 's like this ... i ... we ... all of them .
someone you know ?	yes .
a beauty . who is she ?	a singer . her husband 's an actor . i knew them well . good people . i 'd like to talk to her .
this is my husband . wladyslaw szpilman . marek gebczynski sent him .	oh , yes . i remember .
i 'm going to get a doctor .	you ca n't , it 's too dangerous .
i 'll get dr luczak , we can trust him .	dorota , do n't be ridiculous , he 's a pediatrician .
hello .	i came specially to meet you today . i love your playing , but what a day to choose .
who are you ?	my name 's dorota , i 'm jurek 's sister . oh ! you 're bleeding .
i nagged jurek for weeks and weeks . and at last he gave in and said , 'all right , come with me tomorrow , ' and so i came and they bombed the station .	you know something ? meeting you like that was absolutely wonderful .
really ?	yes ! it was ... it was unforgettable .
i 've always loved your playing , mr. szpilman .	wladek , please .
oh , mr szpilman , you 're quite ... quite wonderful .	wladek , please .
dorota !	i did n't want to come , i did n't want to see all this , but i could n't stop myself .
how are you doing ?	fine , no , not really , they arrested my cousin , but jurek says they 'll let him out . this is disgraceful .
do n't worry , it wo n't last long .	that 's what i said , it 's so - it 's too absurd !
wladyslaw szpilman .	dorota .
sit .	i 'm sorry - i was given this address . i 'm looking for a mr -- -- a mr dzikiewicz .
i need help .	he 'll be back before curfew .
i 've been in hiding . i need somewhere to stay .	he 'll be here soon .
how long have you been married ?	just over a year .
and how 's yurek ?	dead .
when 's your baby due ?	christmas . this is not a good time to have children . but then ...
what did i tell you ?	what are you doing ?
will i still be able to play ?	let 's find out .
let me see this .	does n't it say we have to provide these armbands ourselves ? where will we get them ?
to tell you the truth , i thought it would be worse .	how will we sleep ?
for what ? for my tie ?	american jews , and there 's lots of them , what have they done for us ? what do they think they 're doing ? people here are dying , have n't got a bite to eat . the jewish bankers over there should be persuading america to declare war on germany !
it 's not going to be very comfortable .	i 'll be fine .
must feel better this side of the wall .	yes , but sometimes i 'm still not sure which side of the wall i 'm on .
get your things together , you have to leave !	what 's happened ?
i 'm on the run !	what 's happened ?
the gestapo found our weapons . they 've arrested janina and andrzej . they 're bound to find out about this place , too - you must get away at once .	where do you want me to go ? look at me . no , no , i 'm not leaving . ca n't i take my chances here ?
have you seen this ?	what , i 'm working , what ?
what 's happened ?	oh my god , it 's terrible , you 've got to do something , oh my god !
calm down , what , what is it ?	they 're hunting people on the streets . they 've picked up henryk .
halina ?	what ?
funny time to say this .	what ?
wish i knew you better .	thanks .
henryk 's in there .	i have n't seen him .
believe me , they 've picked him up .	tough luck .
can you help ?	oh , you need me now , yes , now you need me !
can you help us ?	it costs .
i 've no money .	then there 's nothing i can do . he should 've joined us when i gave him the chance..
yitzchak , they told me you had influence .	who told you ?
we 're recruiting .	who 's recruiting ?
do n't be clever with me , henryk . i 've come here as a friend . they 're bringing jews in from all over the country . soon there 'll be half a million people in the ghetto . we need more jewish police ...	oh ? more jewish police ? you mean you want me to wear a cap like yours , beat up jews with my truncheon and catch the gestapo spirit . i see !
someone 's got to do it , henryk .	but why me ? i thought you only recruited boys with rich fathers . look at my father , look at us , i mean ...
yes , i 'm looking at you and that 's why i 'm here . your whole family can have a better life . you want to go on struggling for survival , selling books on the street ?	yes , please .
and suppose they take the table away ?	what d'you mean , take the table away ?
the germans go into jewish homes and they just take what they want , furniture , valuables , anything .	do they ?
what 's this about ?	sit down , have tea , i 'll start lunch when the girls get back .
and , please , tonight , for once , i do n't want anything bad talked about . let 's enjoy our meal .	okay , then i 'll tell you something funny . you know who i mean by dr. raszeja .
henryk , i said nothing bad .	what 's the matter with you all ? have you lost your sense of humour ?
boys , boys ...	your work , yes , playing the piano for all the parasites in the ghetto , they do n't give a damn about people 's sufferings , they do n't even notice what 's going on around them !
they bombed us , we 're off the air .	warsaw 's not the only radio station .
mama , that was a great dinner .	it certainly was .
no , no . listen , i 've been thinking --	that makes a change .
you know what we do ? we use psychology .	we use what ?
we leave the money and the watch on the table . and we cover it like this . in full view . the germans will search high and low , i promise you , they 'll never notice it .	of course they 'll notice it . but look -- this is a good place for something .
a good place for what ? he 's insane !	just shut up .
but ... they wo n't get all of us ... we 'll ... it 's too small ... there 's four hundred thousand of us in warsaw !	no . three hundred and sixty thousand , so it 'll be easy .
you sell anything ?	just one . dostoevsky . the idiot . three zlotys .
that 's better than yesterday .	three lousy zlotys . and there are people here making millions .
i know .	you do n't know , believe me . they bribe the guards . the guards turn a blind eye . they 're bringing in cartloads , food , tobacco , liquor , french cosmetics , and the poor are dying all around them and they do n't give a damn .
it 's not funny .	well , you know what 's funny ? you 're funny with that ridiculous tie .
you go to heller , did i ask you to talk to him ?	you 're out , are n't you ?
did you beg , did you grovel to that piece of shit , that cockroach ?	i did n't grovel , i asked him to help .
what did you pay him ?	pay him ? with what ? with what could i pay him ? every zloty i earn we spend on food !
i can look after myself !	they were taking you away .
it 's nothing to do with you . it 's me they wanted , not you . why do you interfere in other people 's business ?	you 're mad , that 's your trouble , you 're mad .
what 's the matter ? are you sick ?	hungry .
what 's that mean , no employment certificate ?	you have to have an employment certificate to work for one of the german firms in the ghetto , otherwise ...
otherwise what ?	you 'll be deported .
what are you reading ?	'if you prick us , do we not bleed ? if you tickle us , do we not laugh ? if you poison us , do we not die ? and if you wrong us , shall we not revenge ? '
very appropriate .	yes , that 's why i brought it .
no one thought they 'd hold out so long .	should never have come out . i should 've stayed there , fought with them .
wladek , stop that . it 's over now . just be proud it happened . my god , did they put up a fight .	yes , so did the germans .
they 're in shock . they did n't expect it . nobody expected it . jews fighting back ? who 'd have thought ?	yes , but what good did it do ?
ah , here . today 's news from the other side .	you 're amazing , jehuda .
no , i 'm a socialist . i have brothers everywhere . they bring me news and food . we care about our fellow human beings . workers of the world unite .	so , what 's the news ?
the germans are advancing on kharkhov .	i do n't know why i come here every evening , it 's always such bad news .
jehuda , give me something to do .	you 're an artist , wladek , you keep people 's spirits up . you do enough .
but i want to help , i want to .	you 're too well known , wladek . and you know what ? you musicians do n't make good conspirators . you 're too ... too musical .
there are notices going up . the city 's to be cleansed of undesirables .	there are always notices going up .
five hundred . you know how many people on average read one copy ? twenty . that makes ten thousand readers . these will start the uprising . majorek hides them in his underpants . and leaves them in toilets .	toilets ?
i thought you 'd be off on tour , playing london , paris , new york ?	not this week .
i have to say you look terrible . what 's the trouble ?	you 've heard the rumours they 're going to resettle us in the east ?
rumours , rumours , you take it all too much to heart , wladek .	i 've been trying to get a certificate of employment for my father . i 've managed to get certificates for me and the rest of the family but i need one more for my father . i 've been trying all the firms , the shops ...
why did n't you come to me ?	i did n't know you were in the certificate business .
i 'm not , but majorek is .	can you help ? i 've no money ...
jurek ? wladek szpilman .	wladek ! how are you ?
fine , we 're fine , thank you , and you ?	fine , we 're fine in the circumstances . but i can guess what you 've called about . there 's nothing we can do ; they wo n't reopen the station --
yes , i know , but jurek , jurek ...	... not even music , nothing , no radios for the poles . but i 'm sure you 'll find work , wladek , a pianist like you .
puppydog , what d'you mean , you forgot ?	what d'you think i mean , kitten ? i forgot , that 's what i mean .
you know what ? you treat me like dirt !	i treat you like dirt because you are dirt .
pig !	cow !
pig !	bitch !
dirty pig !	you 're a dirty pig !
if i play like an angel , why do n't you listen ?	i was listening , kitten .
how long have you been here ?	since last night . i was pleased to see you .
they 're going to start the final resettlement now . we know what it means . we sent someone out . zygmunt . a good man . his orders were to follow the trains out of warsaw . he got to sokolow . a local railwayman told him the tracks are divided , one branch leading to treblinka . he said every day freight trains carrying people from warsaw forked to treblinka and returned empty . no transports of food are ever seen on that line . and civilians are forbidden to approach the treblinka station . they 're exterminating us . wo n't take them long . we 're sixty thousand left . out of half a million . mostly young people . and this time we 're going to fight . we 're in good shape . we 're organised . we 're prepared .	if you need help ...
have a favour to ask . i want to get out of here .	it 's easy to get out , it 's how you survive on the other side that 's hard .
i tried your friends . they 're not at that address any more . but .	you made contact ?
thank god - wladek ! you 're wounded .	it 's a little cut , nothing .
pack , darling , get your things , pack .	where are we going ?
out of warsaw .	out of warsaw . where ?
and what do you think you 'll do while you 're setting up a new line of defence ? wander round lugging your suitcases ?	pack , wladek , there 's no time .
no , no , no , i 'm staying put . if i 'm going to die , i prefer to die at home .	god forbid !
i 'm sorry , i did my best , i thought the certificates would save us all .	stop it , wladek .
you do n't remember me , mr. szpilman ?	no , i do n't think so ?
warsaw radio . i was a technician . i saw you almost every day .	sorry , i do n't remember .
you do n't want to worry about that . my grandfather was jilted by his girl friend when he got jaundice . in my opinion , jaundice is not very serious . drink up .	why did n't you come sooner ? it 's been over two weeks .

i knew she was mute , but now i 'm thinking it 's more than that . i 'm wondering if she 's not brain affected .	no sound at all ?
no , it was a table .	well , she was very violent with the gown . she tore off a chunk of lace . if had n't been there i 'd have sworn she 'd used her teeth
oh , yes , yes of course , a concern .	there is something to be said for silence

granger , this is combs . why have n't we heard from ya ? everybody else is in .	we had a few problems with the law this morning . the mayor promised the jaycees to get tough on the rackets again , so he shut everybody down for a couple hours to make it look good . nothing serious , it just put us a little behind for the day .
you been making your payoffs , have n't ya ?	hell yes . he does this every year . there 's nothing to worry about .
okay , finish your count and get it up here as soon as you can . i do n't wanta be here all night .	believe me , the man 's gon na be real happy . looks like we cleared over ten grand this week .
we cleared 22 here .	well , hell , you got the whole chicago south side . how do ya expect the eight lousy spots i 've got to compete with that ?
i just got the count . we 'll put the take on the 4:15 .	we 'll be waitin ' .
buck duff . i was in maxwell 's boost in troy .	you the duff that did n't come up with his end when little jeff was sent up ?
was n't no problem a mine .	he was a con man , was n't he ?
he was a tear-off rat . he got what he deserved . no sense helpin ' pay his bills .	shove off , duff .
hey , luther told me he was carrying a wad , but i did n't figure this much .	which way did he do , eirie ?
straight north . he was gon na take it all and run .	the bastard . he can blow his nose all the way .
how do you like that coleman , huh ? after three years .	aw come on , it was the only thing to do . he knew he was holdin ' ya back .
we were partners . if it were n't for luther i 'd still be hustlin ' pinball down at gianelli 's . i do n't need anything more than i got .	you ai n't gon na have nothin ' if you do n't lay off them games of chance . there 's a depression on ya know .
there 's always a depression on .	if you saved a little , you would n't have to grift so much .
i like griftin ' .	you could buy yourself some things . clothes , or a nice car ...
i do n't look any good in clothes and i do n't know how to drive . what else ya got to sell , eirie ?	forget it .
i thought you blew all your money .	i did . that stuff i gave him was counterfeit . they 'll pinch him the first place he tries to spend it .
what the hell you gon na do when snyder rushes his finger right to lonnegan ? you 're committin ' suicide , kid .	aw christ , it does n't make no difference now . if snyder knows about it so does everybody else . he never gets anything first ... damn , there 's no answer at luther 's .
doyle , can i see you a minute ?	i 'm busy , floyd .
it 's important . we had a little trouble in chicago today . one of our runners got hit for 12 grand .	which one ?
mottola .	you sure he did n't just pocket it ?
no , we checked his story with a tipster . he was cleaned by two grifters on 47th .	they workin ' for anybody ?
i do n't know . could be . we 're runnin ' that down now .	all right , mark mottola up a little and put him on a bus . nothin ' fancy , just enough to keep him from coming back . get some local people to take care of the other two . we got ta discourage this kinda thing .
we got word from chicago . they got one of the grifters last night . the nigger .	what about the other one ?
they 're still looking for him .	who 's got the contract ?
combs gave it to reilly and cole .	hackers .
name 's danny mccoy . no neck mccoy we called him . runs a few protection rackets for carnello while he 's waiting for something bigger to come along . me and danny been friends since we were six . take a good look at that face , floyd , cause if he ever finds out we let one lousy grifter beat us , you 'll have to kill him and every other hood in chicago who 'd like to do the same thing . you understand what i 'm sayin ' ?	yes sir .
i 've had it with that bum , floyd . stack me a cooler .	you 've only been playin three hours , doyle .
i do n't care . load me a deck . set it up for threes and nines . i 'll cut it in on his deal .	what do ya want the others to get ?
i know i give him four threes . we ca n't let him get away with that .	what am i supposed to do ? call him for cheating better than me ?
looks all right . it 's big enough and off the street .	i do n't know . this is kinda short notice . i 'm not sure we can get it all done by saturday .
been a while since i stocked a wire store . not many mobs playing that anymore .	all we need is the bookie setup for now . we 'll worry about the telegraph office later .
all right , i 'll rent ya everything i got in the warehouse for two grand . that 'll give ya phones , cages , blackboards and ticker gear . you supply the guys to move 'em . if you want a counter and bar , that 's another grand . i do n't know where the hell i 'm gon na get 'em though .	c'mon , you can do better than that . we ai n't no heel grifters .
you want the stuff tomorrow or do n't ya ? it 's gon na take hours just to clean it up . besides , gondorff 's still a hot item . where am i gon na be if he gets hit ?	just give us what ya can , benny . we 'll send a truck down .
we bought ya a tap into moe anenberg 's wire . he 's got eyes at every track in the country . you 'll get race results , odds , scratches , pole positions , everything ; and just as fast as western union gets 'em .	does j.j. know how to use this thing ?
turn the goddamn thing off , will ya .	you sober ?
glad to meet ya , kid . you 're a real horse 's ass .	yeh , luther said you could teach me something . i already know how to drink .
i 'm sorry about luther . he was the best street worker i ever saw .	he had you down as a big-timer . what happened ?
aw , i conned a senator from florida on a stocks deal . a real lop-ear . he thought he was gon na take over general electric . some chantoozie woke him up , though , and he put the feds on me .	you mean you blew it .
luther did n't tell me you had a big mouth .	he did n't tell me you was a fuck- up , either . you played the big con since then .
you gon na stay for breakfast , or do you already know how to eat ?	i picked something up on the way .
lonnegan after you , too ?	i do n't know . have n't seen anybody .
gondorff , you gon na teach me the big con or not ?	you did n't act much like you wanted to learn it .
i wan na play for lonnegan .	you know anything about him ?
aw right , he runs the numbers outta the south side .	and a packing company , a chain of savings and loans and half the politicians in chicago and new york . there ai n't a fix in the world gon na cool him out if he blows on ya .
i 'll take him anyway .	why ?
you ca n't do it alone , ya know . it takes a mob of guys like you and enough money to make 'em look good .	we 'll get by without 'em .
this is n't like playin ' winos on the street . you got ta do more than outrun the guy .	i never played for winos .
you got ta keep lonnegan 's con , even after you spent his money . and no matter how much you take from his , he 'll get more .	you 're sacred of 'em , are n't ya ?
right down to my socks , turkey . if i'da been half as scared a that lop-ear , i would n't a fallen asleep on 'em . lonnegan might kill me , but at least he wo n't bore me to death .	then you 'll do it ?
he 's not as tough as he 'd like to think .	neither are we .
he 's waitin ' for you in the card room .	let him wait .
you just worry about your end , kid .	if we ever get to it .
how 'd ya do ?	well we got some workin ' money anyway .
everything go all right ?	yeh , it was easy .
no signs of trouble ?	what do ya mean ?
you know , somebody tailin ' ya . a torpedo or somethin ' .	no , not a thing .
how 'bout lonnegan ?	i gave him the breakdown just like ya told me to .
and ?	he threatened to kill me .
then he drove me home . he tried to put himself away as legit , so i went right into the pitch .	did he hold you up on anything ?
you think he 'll show ?	did he say he would n't ?
no .	he 'll show .
why did n't you tell me about snyder before ?	i thought i 'd lost him .
well you found him again and we 're gon na have to do somethin ' about it . what else have n't ya been tellin ' me ?	nothin ' . i told ya everything there is .
then why 'd ya move outa your room ?	it was too noisy .
you know how easy it 'd be for one of lonnegan 's guys to nail you ?	all we need is a couple days , henry . a couple days and we 'll get lonnegan down and stomp on 'em .
you just wo n't learn , will ya . hell , you come in here , i teach you stuff maybe five guys in this world know , stuff most grifters could n't do even if they knew it , and all you wan na do is run down a bullet . you 're just like all them new jerks . lotsa nerve and no brains . and ten years from now when me and the others are through and you dumb guys are all dead there wo n't be one gee left who knows the big con was anything more than a way to make a livin ' .	a couple days ; that 's all i 'm askin ' . i can stay clear that long .
what 's the matter , kid ? you 're not sayin ' much .	just a little nervous , that 's all .
take it easy , you wo n't lose him now . we had him 10 years ago when he decided to be somebody . believe me , i 've seen enough to know .	how many guys you conned in your life , henry ?
i better do some packin ' . i 'm gon na be a hot number again after tomorrow .	then why you doin ' it ?
henry .	yeh .
i appreciate your stickin ' your neck out . i would n't have asked ya if it were n't for luther .	ai n't nothin ' gon na make up for luther , kid . revenge is for suckers . i been griftin ' 30 years and never got any .
you beat him , kid .	you were right , henry . it 's not enough ... but it 's close .
you wanta wait for your share ?	naw , i 'd just blow it .
he 's been taking the 8:10 century limited outa new york on friday and getting in here early saturday morning . he usually stays a day to check on his policy operations , and then flies back .	wonder why he does n't fly both ways .
the porters say he runs a braced card game in one of the cars . $ 100 minimum , straight poker . last time he pulled in here ten grand heavier than he left new york .	fancies himself a gambler , huh ?
we 'll use the wire . never known a gambler who would n't like to beat the ponies .	the wire is ten years outa date .
all you got ta do is show up with some money and look like a fool .	i also got ta win .
he 's gon na hit ya with 20 grand , eddie . how much cash we got ?	not enough to cover a bet that big .
looks like he 's sulking .	if we 're lucky , this 'll bring him back stronger than ever .
what 's the problem ?	he wants to put a half million on syphon .
lonnegan 's a fast egg , henry . he 's not gon na sit still for a standard play .	everybody 'll sit still for somethin ' . what did ya find out about the train , eddie ?
i 'm not sure i know it .	we 'll give him the hook on the train , and play him here . you think i can get in that poker game , eddie ?
you in ?	yeh , i think so . i gave the kay- ducer a c-note . you find out the deck ?
he usually plays with a royal or a cadenza . i got you one of each . he likes to cold deck low , 8 's or 9 's .	nice work , j.j .
look at that . he 's got four apes with him .	that 's what i like about these guys , j.j ... they always got protection against things we 'd never do to 'em .
how ya doin ' ?	nothin ' yet . i got a good one on the lead at hialeah , but he 's fadin ' .
yeh , that 'd be real nice of ya , mr. lonneman .	lonnegan .
raise 500 .	see ya and raise three .
see and raise five .	five and call .
raise 300 .	pass .
raise 1,000 .	raise 500 .
see and raise 1,000 .	raise 5,000 .
i guess i left it in my room .	what ! do n't give me that crap you little weenie . how do i know you ai n't gon na take a powder . you come to a game like this , you bring your money .
never get enough , huh pal ? i 'd think you 'd get tired of losin ' , honnigan .	the name is lonnegan .
i ca n't lay that off in time . we lose a bet that big , it could break us .	if ya win it could make ya , too .
a half mill on an eight to one shot . you 're dumber than i thought , lonnegan .	you 're more gutless than i thought .
she coulda killed me last night .	too many people coulda seen ya go in her room . she was a professional . used to work in the dutch schultz gang .
who are you ?	gondorff asked me to look after ya .
how do i know you 're tellin ' the truth .	do n't have much choice , do ya ?
hi there , snyder . things a little slow down at the bunco department tonight , eh ? somebody lose the dominoes ?	you scored blood money today , hooker . you need a friend .
i 'll tell ya what you did , smart boy . you tied into a loaded mark on 47th across from maxies . you and coleman played the switch for him and blew him off to a cab on 49th . if he had n't been a numbers runner for doyle lonnegan , it woulda been perfect .	you 're crazy . i 'm not stupid enough to play for rackets money .
not intentionally maybe , but that do n't make no difference to lonnegan . he 'll swat you like any fly .	i 'll square it with the fixer .
my end was only one .	then you 'll have to come up with another grand somewhere .
excuse me , sir . treasury dept ... i 'd like to ask you a few questions .	what for ? i have n't done anything .
we do n't doubt that , but there 's a counterfeiting operation passing bad money in the station . have you made any purchases here today ?	yes , a ticket to chicago .
then i 'm afraid we 'll have to impound your money until we 're sure that it 's all good . can i see your wallet and your ticket , please ?	but i got a train to make .
it 'll only take 20 minutes or so . you can pick it up at the window down the hall .	but what about all these other people ?
i 'm sorry , really i am , but my train leaves in ten minutes .	all right , i 'll give ya a break . down that hall there , there 's an unmarked door on the left . go on in there and wait at the window . i 'll take this ... ... in the back and run it through right away . we 'll have you outta there in a couple minutes .
thank you . you do n't know how much i appreciate this .	think nothin ' of it .
you done ?	yeh , i guess i shoulda had the meat loaf .
it is n't any better .	where 's june today ?
she do n't work here no more . i 'm fillin ' in for a couple days ... till i can get a train outa here .	where you goin ' ?
meat loaf , apple pie and a cup of coffee .	sixty-five .
what time you get off work here ?	2:00 a.m .
you doin ' anything tonight ?	yeh , sleepin ' .
you got a back door to this place ?	no . what 's wrong with the front ?
look , i do n't have time to fuck around . there 's somebody out there i do n't need to see . you got a fire escape or anything ?	no .
all right , do me a favor . go into the bathroom , open the window and wait for me there .	what the hell for ?
what does this guy want ?	he 'd like to kill me .
looks like he missed ya .	yeh , this time anyway .
i , ah ... thought you might wan na come out for a while . maybe have a drink or somethin ' .	you move right along , do n't ya .
i do n't mean nothin ' by it . i just do n't know many regular girls , that 's all .	and you expect me to come over , just like that .
i do n't even know you .	you know me . i 'm just like you ... it 's two in the morning and i do n't know nobody .
you sure it 'll be one of these two ?	no . they 're just the only ones we know of .
twist ? i told him the tale . he wants to see ya .	all right , when ?
tomorrow , after 4:00. stay inside , i 'll come in and get ya . and be hard on him for a while ; he 's talking money .	okay , tootsie .
les , i got mr. lonnegan with me . he wants to see you a second .	what the hell 's the matter with you . we coulda met at a club or somethin ' .
i thought it might be good for him to see the setup .	well we ca n't talk in here . they 're having the place painted .
hooker !	how ya doin ' , jimmy .
ai n't seen you in months , boy . thought maybe you took a fall .	naw , just a little hard times , that 's all . it 's all over now .
you sure you wan na start off that big ? bet like that could put a real dent in us .	i feel lucky tonight .
aw , come on , hooker , why do n't you just ...	three grand on the black , jimmy .
your boss is quite a card player , carver . how does he do it ?	he cheats .
he 'll have to take a check . i could n't find my wallet .	yeh , he knows that .
what do you mean ?	he hired a dame to take it from ya .
you were set up , lonnegan . shaw 's been planning to beat your game for months . he was just waiting for you to cheat him so he could clip ya .	i could have you put under this train for this , errand boy .
so could shaw .	then why the rat ?
what 's the matter ? you got ta get back to shaw ?	naw , he picked up some jane in the bar . ca n't see him till morning anyway .
why me ? shaw probably has lotsa enemies to choose from .	i need somebody respectable ... but not completely legit . what i 'm gon na do is n't very legal .
i 'm a banker , friend . that 's legit in this state .	all you got ta do is place a bet for me at shaw 's place . i 'll supply all the money and the information .
if you help me out , i 'll pay ya back the money you owe shaw , myself .	that 's worth fifteen grand to ya ?
you 're dreamin ' , kid .	660 marshall street . tomorrow at 12:30 , if you 're interested .
you should always look to the back too , kid .	i was afraid you were n't gon na come . we have n't got much time .
get on with it then .	sometime after 1:00 a guy 's gon na call here and give you the name of a horse . all you do is take this two grand across the street to shaw 's place and bet it on that pony . there 's nothin ' to it , but do n't take too much time . we only have 3 or 4 minutes after you get the call .
you 're not gon na break him with a $ 2,000 bet .	this is just a test . the big one comes later . be careful with that though , it 's all i got .
and you were gon na pay me back ?	i am after this race .
you really picked a winner , kid .	give 'em a little time .
well , what did i tell ya ?	you 're a lucky man , all right .
lucky , hell . i could do it every day .	why do n't ya then .
'cause it 's better to do it all at once . we 're puttin ' down 400 grand next week . at 5-1 we make 2 million . twenty per cent of that is yours if ya stick with us .	you got a system , carver ?
you stayin ' in or not ?	i 'm in .
you got the 400 grand yet ?	not yet , but ... hey , there 's only a grand here .
i think we oughta place another bet tomorrow .	what is this ? that 's my money . you tryin ' to muscle me ?
i got ta talk to me partner first . we ca n't afford to expose our game too much .	let me talk to him .
no .	you want your money back ? try and get it in a court of law . c'mon , do n't be a sorehead . i 'll make it worth your while . migth even help ya finance the big play if this one works out .
what happened to your face ?	had a little fight with a raggle down on 13th . she got me with her ring .
a week 's a long time , friend . anything can happen . all of it bad .	he 's right , les .
what happened ?	i did n't get the bet down in time .
tell your friend i 'll have the money here by post-time tomorrow . we 'll take the first race where the odds are 4-1 or better . and make sure i can get to that window this time .	how am i gon na do that ?
you want a drink or something ?	no .
we want to talk to ya about henry gondorff .	do n't think i know him .
well give yourself a couple seconds , crumb . you would n't wan na lie to me . lt. snyder here says you done a lotta griftin ' in this town .	lt. snyder does n't know shit .
you got nothin ' on me .	we 'll get it , and if we ca n't , we 'll just make it up . grand larceny , extortion . counterfeiting , anything you want .
look , i got nothin ' against you , but you 're in trouble here . all you got ta do is tell us when gondorff 's gon na play his chump . we come in at the sting , make the pinch , and you walk out free as a bird . no questions , no court appearance , nothing .	no .
you 've already done time twice , and judges do n't like three time losers . you wan na sit in the can for forty years , startin ' tonight ?	i 'll make parole .
will you wait until the chump is played ?	hell yes . we do n't care about the mark . he deserves what he gets .
i mean completely played . until he 's beat and the score is taken . you come in before we beat him and i 'll kill him . you 'll have a tough time explaining that , wo n't ya .	all right , hooker , but you take it on the lam , and we 'll shoot you down on sight .
ca n't do it . there 're telegraph inspectors all over the place . i got 750 grand coming in from the coast , and i 'm not gon na blow it for a lousy 14 gees . we 'll get somebody else to do our betting .	i could come up with 750 grand in a day if i had a reason to .
but who says you will . i got a guy i can depend on . he 's liquidating everything he has for this . you would n't even give carver his money back .	i need more proof , that 's all . anybody can get lucky once .
on a 6-1 shot ? the hell with ya . we 'll keep the deal we got .	if it works again tomorrow , i 'll have a half million in cash here by noon the next day . we split 60-40 .
we were getting 50 from our guy .	with 20 % coming off the top for me laying your bet . either way you end up with 40 .
yeh , and what if we play tomorrow and he does n't come up with the money . we risk our whole operation for nothing . i 'll say when we make our bets .	not if you want me to keep makin ' 'em for ya .
take it easy . everything 's all right . i put it on syphon , on the nose .	on the nose ! i said place . place it on syphon . that horse is going to run second .
all right , riley . what the hell happened ?	we missed him .
you were n't hired to miss him .	there was n't any way he coulda known we was in there . we made a clean pick on the lock and did n't leave no footprints in the hall . somebody musta wised him up .
yeh , and what does cole say about that ?	i do n't know . he took it hard .
we 'll take it . you manage the building at the end of the alley ?	for fifteen years .
i 'll need a room over there that faces this way . how much a week ?	only rents by the month . two hundred and fifty for the two of them .
this is the last time i expect to see you down here .	never heard of the place .
what is this ? i got work to do .	sit down and shut up , will ya . try not to live up to all my expectations . we were told you know a hustle artist named johnny hooker .
do ya know him or do n't ya ?	yeh , but i do n't know where he is .
well we do . he 's chummin ' around with a big c named henry gondorff . ring any bells ?	sure . every bunco man in the country knows gondorff .
there 's word he 's gon na run a con on the north side here . we got a year-old florida warrant on him , but it 's a thin beef , and he can beat it in court unless we catch him cold . all we want you to do is pick up hooker for us .	why do n't you pick him up yourself ?
cause the stoolies are used to street dicks jumpin ' him . if word gets around that feds are in on it too , gondorff 'll fold up the whole thing .	would n't that be too bad . you 'd hafta move outa this nice office ya got .
do n't crack wise to me , flatfoot . i spent a lotta time in dumps like this , eatin ' gondorff 's dust while the bunco squad gets rich tippin ' him off . but it 's not gon na happen this time . we 're not even gon na let the police know we 're here . if you keep your mouth shut and do a job , there 'll be a promotion in it for ya . and you better take it , cause i can make ya work for us without it .	what the hell good is hooker to ya ?
he 's gon na set up gondorff for us .	he 'll never do it .
sorry . i do n't know anything about it .	come on , gim me a break .
have the police got any idea where wynant is ?	no .
what about this rosebreen ?	sorry . do n't know a thing .
what 's your next step , nick ?	right back to california . we 've got to go home and rest up from our vacation .
there 's a physiological as well as a psychological angle in my father 's relationship with julia wolf that the police have overlooked . and i think it explains everything . you see , my father was a sexogenarian .	he was ?
yes . he admitted it .	sexogerarian , eh ? yes . yes . but i ca n't put that in the paper .
why not ?	you know how they are ... sex ...
then just say he was sixty years old .	is that what it means ?
i did n't know you invented that smelting process .	look -- those are the first metals that came through .
all settled ? grand ! why did your mother ever divorce him ? he 's swell .	wel-l-l , it seems he has a secretary .
cheer up , darling .	i 'm sorry .
what 's the matter , darling ... not sweet enough ?	it 's all right .
darling , your father 's all right . he 'll turn up in time .	but tonight is christmas eve !
he 's just forgotten . you know he forgets everything .	he 's never forgotten a promise to me . i 'm worried about him . i know something 's happened to him .
what could happen to him , darling ? you must n't worry ... . what is it ?	just a minute ...
now do n't say that -- he 's just off somewhere working .	i ca n't find him . i 've tried everything . i thought you might know .
any luck ?	he 's just around the corner .
she 's got me worrying , too .	do n't start worrying about him . he 's a good guy , but screwy .
why did that man want to kill him ?	said he stole his invention .
what ?	nothing .
how are you ?	another young man .
well !	that is , if it 's all right with you .
mind if i look around ?	help yourself . oh , tom , show this gentleman ...
oh , andy .	do n't cry .
i ca n't help it . you do n't know ... ..	darling , you ca n't go through any more of this . now you get together your clothes and your skates and we 'll go out to my family 's in the country .
i ca n't .	you 've got to get your mind off this .
you 're sweet , but the only thing that you can do for me is to go .	go !
and do n't ever try to see me again .	what are you talking about ?
please ! you ca n't get mixed up in this .	do you think i care
you do n't understand . you do n't know what 's going to happen .	i only know i want to marry you ... right now , and --
i ca n't marry you ! i ca n't ever marry you !	dorothy !
how would you like to have a couple of little murderers for your children ? it 'd be fun , would n't it ? maybe they 'd murder each other ... keep it all in the family . that 's what father should have done . he should have killed me and gilbert ... then we would n't have had this to go through .	you 're talking like a crazy person ,
why not ? i am crazy ... .the whole family 's crazy .	dorothy ... . listen to me . i love you . do n't you understand that ? i love you .
this is a pretty dead bunch , is n't it ?	you 're high enough .
darling , do n't cry . please . i know it 's terrible . but is n't it really better this way ?	oh , andy , andy !
how are you ? ... . oh , i 'm mrs. jorgensen now ... . no , she is n't here . is it about her father ? well , can i take the message ?	give it to me .
what is it ? has he found him ?	do you know where he 's living ? oh ... . well , at least i 'm glad he 's all right . thank you for calling . goodbye .
what is it ?	nothing .
that is n't true . it was about your father . where is he ?	he 's all right . is n't that enough ?
no .	you just want money -- and you have n't any right to any more . he made a big settlement on you .
that 's gone long ago . i 've got to see him . where is he ?	i wo n't have you hounding him any more for money .
mother ... . you could n't do that . you could n't go to her .	i did n't say i would . but we 've got to have money .
did it ever occur to you that chris might work ?	shush !
do n't . it 's horrible .	nonsense ! she got at she deserved .
you took that money from julia 's hand .	i did n't .
then what are you hiding ?	it 's a piece of evidence that 's worth a great deal more than that .
you hand that over to the police .	i 'll do nothing of the sort .
all right , then . i 'll tell them .	i do n't think you will . it 's your father 's .
i do n't believe it ! you 're lying !	there !
oh !	now do you believe me !
mother !	and i 'll give then proof !
how are you ? here . get under this .	thanks ... we 're taking your cab .
is your father still in there ?	he 's waiting for you .
did he tell you where he was going ?	he would n't say .
he did n't do it -- nick !	what do you mean ?
another martini --	hello , there !
you know , we know each other .	of course we do ! we 've been friends for years .
are n't you nick charles ?	yes .
not that scrawny little ... . ?	yes .
how did you ever remember me ?	was fascinated with you ... . a real live detective ... . you used to tell me the most wonderful stories . were they true ?
andy ... this is nick charles . he worked on a case for father .	yes . some nut who wanted to kill him . how is your father ?
that 's what i was going to ask you . he 's disappeared !	disappeared !
i do n't know anything -- i 've been in california for four years . what about his lawyer ? used to be a guy named mac -- something .	macaulay .
that 's it ... herbert macaulay .	tried him once -
your father ?	no . the lawyer -- i 'm going to see him .
how do you do ? i 'm sorry we have to rush .	we 're at the normandie for a couple of weeks . why do n't you drop around ?
i just wanted to relieve your mind . your father 's alive and all right .	oh , thank heaven .
come on in .	i 've got to see you alone !
you heard about julia wolf ?	yes .
there .	what are you trying to tell me ? that you did it ?
yes . i hated her for coming between my mother and father . she kept me from seeing my father . i went down there to ask her where he was . she would n't tell me , and i shot her .	where did you hit her ?
why ... in the heart .	pretty good shot you are . what did she do ?
she fell down .	did she make any sound ? did n't scream ?
i do n't know .	which way did she fall ?
she ... she fell over backwards .	oh , yeah ? people fall toward a shot , you know ... not back from it . i knew you were lying .
where did you get this gun ?	i bought it in a pawn shop .
do n't lie to me .	that 's the truth .
hello , dorothy .	hello , nick ! and a party - celebrating father 's third murder -
dead ?	he 's been dead for three months .
it 's been the same one for three months .	forgive me . how are you ?
he 'll still be your son-in-law !	you see how much we have to say .
mother 's set her heart on a big church wedding .	yes , she would .
i hate all that fuss . but i 'll do it on one condition -- that you 're there to give me away .	what would your mother say to that ?
this is my wedding .	would n't it be a little embarrassing ... all of us there ... your other and me and your stepfather ?
he can stay home . please , dad , wo n't you ?	if you think it 'll be all right .
wait a minute . when is it going to be ? i 'm leaving town tonight .	where are you going ?
it 's a secret . i ca n't even tell you , my dear . i 've got an important idea to work on .	a new invention ?
yes . and i do n't want anybody to steal it from me .	we were planning to be married right after christmas .
oh , i 'll be back before christmas .	it 's a promise ?
how 's your brother ?	he 's all right .
i 'd like to see him . why do n't you bring him down ?	you know how it is , dad . he 's sort of under mother 's thumb .
i know -- i know --	you 're not missing much . he 's cuckoo .
like all the rest of us . has this fellow ... ... has he seen the whole family ?	and he still wants to marry me !
poor dad , does that still bother you ?	only in bad weather .
but it is n't bad weather now .	better get home before it is .
goodbye , darling . do n't you dare forget ... december 30th .	goodbye , my boy . take care of dorothy . show her that there is such a thing as a happy marriage .
you can take that out to the car .	going to run him through the fluoroscope ?
yes .	do you mind if i come down and see it ?
not at all .	i 'm very interested in that body .
shrapnel !	must have been in the war . that might account for the cane and his limp .
what is it , gilbert ? tell mother ! what did he say ?	he said that father 's in town . he 's been seeing julia right along .
that woman !	she could tell you where father is .
did they find any clues ... a gun or fingerprints or anything ?	not a thing .
did you kill her ?	gilbert !
why not ? you had a perfectly good motive .	i hope you wo n't talk that way to the police when they come here .
well , i 've got my alibi . i was at the public library . where were you ?	children , will you go into the next room ? i want to talk to chris alone .
i saw him too ... he was wearing a green suit with a white tie ...	what are you talking about , gilbert ? you were n't there !
how 'd you people happen to pop in ?	we hear this is getting to be sort of a meeting place for the wynant family , so we figure we 'll stick around in case the old man himself shows up . then we seen him ... ... sneak in and we decide to come up . and pretty lucky for you .
yes . i might not have been shot .	we were looking for this bird .
i never saw him before .	what 's he want of you ?
wanted to tell me he did n't kill julia wolf .	what 's that to you ?
nothing .	what 'd he think it was to you ?
ask him . i do n't know .	i 'm asking you .
not without a warrant .	so you say - go on , bob .
have you got a pistol permit ?	no .
this gun yours ?	no .
who 's is it ?	i 'll have to try to remember .
you ought n't to play this trick on me . running out when i was giving you time to rest up before i asked you those questions .	you mean about that gun ?
man to man , mr. charles , are you working on this case ?	man to man , i 'm not .
so would i .	it 's a bargain then . anything you want to know ?
what about the suicide ?	oh , that 's a phoney . the men did n't even have to go down .
you 've been there ?	yeah . could n't find a thing . this is the way we figure it . wynant goes to julia 's apartment . he finds morelli there ... sees she 's two- timing him . they have a fight . but he figures he do n't want to do anything then ... . morelli might squeal . so he goes away . he do n't let his lawyer know anything has happened ... he lets him go ahead and and hand over money to julia to give to him , so that julia will think it 's all blown over . then , when she do n't expect it ... he lets her have it .
no proof ?	nothing yet to cinch it .
fifty will get you a hundred that he did n't do it .	what do you mean ?
for one thing , he was too absent- minded to hold a grudge .	who 's your candidate ?
i have n't got that far yet . but i do n't think that everything points to wynant . what about the alibis ?	they 're all o.k . mrs. jorgensen , the boy , dorothy , macaulay ... even morelli ... we had to let him go .
what about jorgensen ?	i 'll check on that . i 'm afraid this is kinder dull for you .
what about this nunheim ?	oh , he 's all right . we know all about him . he does a little stooling for us every once in a while .
did you know he was hanging around julia ?	no .
he 's holding out on you .	let 's go and see . taxi !
well , what 'd you think ?	i think we 're on the right track .
who 're you calling ?	i 'm calling your office so you can send out a man to trail him . i want to see where he goes .
trail him ! trail who ?	nunheim !
get anything ?	she 's ready to talk . it wo n't do any harm , though - to find out where he is .
i guess that cinches it , eh , mr. charles ? he killed them both - julia wolf and nunheim .	fifty will still get you a hundred .
just rolled them up and threw them in .	lucky thing for us they were n't in that lime .
`` d.w.r . '' that case you worked on ... the guy who threatened to kill wynant ... what what was his name ?	rosebreen .
could this be him ?	i never saw him . i do n't think anyone saw him .
he said wynant tried to steal an invention .	yes . but we figured it was just blackmail ...
what 're you doing here ?	i 'll take care of him .
are you kidding ?	no .
why did n't you tell me ? ... . why did n't you hold him ?	because i found out for certain that he did n't commit the murders .
you mean that body -- -- - ?	-- was wynant 's .
shut up .	you see , he 'd been very clever . everybody , even our astute friend guild , thought that wynant was alive and that he was the murderer . but our hero had just one weak link in his chain . the telegrams , wires and telephones were all very well - but no one had seen wynant . so he picked on poor mimi here to strengthen his case . mimi is the only one at the table who can tell us who the real murderer is . mimi , who was it that told you to say you 'd seen wynant ?
when was the last time you gave her money for wynant ?	yesterday . i gave her a thousand dollars .
i said he had n't written me .	oh , then you did hear from him ?
well ... .	well , what ?
he telephoned me today .	he did !
i was n't in . my secretary took the message . he left word for me to meet him at the plaza .	when was that ?
about three .	did you go ?
i know he 'll turn up as soon as he sees this in the papers . you ca n't think he had anything to do with it , mr. guild . he was n't the kind of man that ... .	do you know what they fought about that night he went away ?
i did n't know they had a fight .	well , thanks . we 'll call you when we need you again .
there are a few things we want to check up on .	i see .
you say you were in the room with the body from the time you discovered it 'til we came ?	why yes .
did you see anything in miss wolfe 's hand ?	no .
are you sure you did n't leave the room ... that one of the bellhops or maids might not have been in there alone ?	i do n't think so . of course i was terribly upset ... i hardly knew what i was doing .
that 's all right . well , we 'll be going .	goodbye .
you did !	that 's nothing . i saw him myself .
what kind of clothes was he wearing ?	a brown suit , brown shoes and a white shirt and a grayish tie with red , or reddish brown figures on it .
that 's ridiculous .	let him have his say out .
good morning --	good morning , lieutenant - sorry .
but he 's interested !	i do n't mind telling you i 'd rather have you working with us than against us .
do you think that wynant did it ?	looks like he planned , something . he shut up his apartment and his shop .
i think we may as well sit down .	i guess all the suspects are here .
mr. guild means guests ! oh , there are two more to come .	they 'll be here . do n't worry . my men are picking them up .
have a shot ?	what 's the idea of telling me you just knew the wolfe girl by sight ?
she drives me nuts . she 's been ragging me all day .	maybe if you quit running around after other women you would n't have so much trouble with this one .
that 's a lie , lieutenant ... anybody that says that is a liar .	want to take a poke at him ?
you 'd done better to have told me that in the beginning . where were you the afternoon she was knocked off ?	you do n't think i had anything to do with it ?
where were you ?	marian ! marian ! do n't go ! i 'll behave ! i 'll do anything ! do n't go , marian !
let me go ! let me bring her back . i ca n't get along without her . i 'll bring her right back and i 'll tell you anything you want to know . let me go !	sit down ! we did n't come here to watch you and that broad dance around a may pole . where were you the afternoon the girl was killed ?
i ca n't remember offhand , lieutenant . maybe i was over at charlie 's shooting pool . maybe i was here . she 'd remember .	how 'd you like to be thrown in the can on account of not remembering ?
do n't mind what she says , chris .	how can i help but mind ? i 'm constantly humiliated ... just because i have n't money .
i 'll get some .	you 've said that for weeks .
i know .	why do n't you go to see julia ? she handles his money .
chris !	all right . all right .
i could n't go near that woman .	i said all right !
what are you going to do ?	just what i said i 'd do .
you would n't do that ... you would n't !	would n't i. just watch me .
and there she was lying dead . the police said she 'd probably been killed about ten minutes before i got there .	i thought you said you were n't going there .
why , you said ...	never mind .
we 're just having a little drink .	so i see .
who 's that man ?	he 's not anybody . just a fellow i used to know .
i thought you 'd given up that sort of friend .	this is the first time i 've seen him in years . i did n't want him to think i was high-hatting him .
i do n't like him .	do n't worry . you wo n't see him again . what happened ? did you change your mind about going ?
no . i just came back for a second . i wanted to get those bonds .	what bonds ?
the government bonds . the ones you took from the office safe .	oh yes . why , you told me to sell them a long time ago .
i 'd never tell you to sell those . i bought them for my daughter .	do n't you remember ... .
now see here , julia . you 're counting a little too much on my being absent-minded . you 've been taking a little here and there for some time , and i have n't said anything about it . but this is fifty thousand dollars !	do you realize that you 're accusing me of ... .
no one else had the combination of that safe . you took them . what did you do with them ?	what if i did take them ? i 'm sick and tired of seeing you hand out thousands of dollars to that family of yours ... .
that 's my business .	supporting that gang of loafers ! there 's not one of them that cares a damn for you . a wife who threw you out the first time your foot slipped . they would n't raise a hand to help you . and i 've given my whole life for you . if you kicked off tomorrow , where 'd i be ? out in the gutter ! sure i took those bonds . who has a better right -- ?
i want that money right now , or i 'll hand you over to the police .	go ahead !
that 's a fine thing to throw up to me after all i 've been to you ... .	hello ... . give me ... . well ... . ?
i 'll give it back to you ... . all i 've got ... .twenty-five thousand ...	you 're going to return every cent of it !
i ca n't ! i have n't got it !	what did you do with the rest ?
i never had it .	then someone was in with you . who was it ? -- who was it ? i 'll answer that -- hello ... hello ...
is there a mr. macaulay in the house ? oh , it 's you .	yes ?
oh , hello . come on in .	good morning . i 'm afraid this is n't a very `` merry christmas '' for you .
oh , he 's sitting up .	good .
asta - do n't bother mr. macaulay .	that 's all right .
i got word from wynant this morning ...	so did we . i mean , sherlock here .
oh , please , nick .	would it help any if i could persuade him to meet you ?
did you get my money ?	i do wish you 'd tell me where you 're going .
i 'm not telling anyone .	but suppose some business comes up ...
one hundred ... two hundred ... three ...	never mind .
i wish you 'd count them . there 's a thousand dollars there .	i trust you .
is n't there anything else i can do for you ? have you bought your ticket ?	no .
well , let me do that for you .	you might do that . get me a ticket for ... no , you do n't !
thanks , and goodbye .	what 'll i do if something comes up ?
settle it yourself . what have i got a lawyer for ?	is julia going with you ?
but what if you need more money ?	i left instructions with julia . she 'll get it from you . goodbye .
how are you ?	hello , macaulay . come in .
dorothy told me you were here . i was going to telephone but ... .	that 's all right . what are you drinking ?
nothing , thank you . nothing . i wanted to see you ... what 's mimi up to , charles ?	mimi ? ... oh , dorothy 's mother . does she have to be up to something ?
she usually is . trying one way or another to get money out of wynant . i wanted to find out if you were er - er - -- sleuthing for her .	i have n't been a detective for four years .
you do n't say --	my wife 's father died and left her a lumber mill and a narrow guage railroad and a couple of other things . and i 'm looking after them .
i see . i see .	what 's all the fuss about ? is he in hiding ?
you know as much about it as i do . i have n't seen him in three months .	no word at all ?
my wife .	how do you do ? what did you say ? ... . he is ? ... . where is he ? very well . he 's back in town ... . wynant . thank heaven . he 's waiting for me now . forgive me , mrs. charles ... but i 've been so upset . it 's no joke working for a man like that . i must be off . goodbye ... . goodbye ,
how are you ?	i hate to bother you when you 're laid up .
what are the chances of getting you to do what he wants ?	slim .
it might .	he gave me a code message to insert in the times , in case i wanted to get in touch with him .
i 've done that already . he should appear , you know . it does n't look well ... his staying away at a time like this .	hello ... . oh , just a minute . police department ?
but it must have been wynant . i should have known if it were n't his voice .	oh he as clever about that . he called when you were out . that same afternoon , julia telephoned to him . she said that you were coming , mimi , to ask about wynant . he got terrified . he was afraid that julia would break down and tell ... so he went to julia and killed her and left wynant 's watch chain in her hand .
i have no right to answer that .	what about it , tanner . is n't that the truth ?
oh , nick ... nick !	hello , mimi .
clyde wynant 's crazy ... absolutely crazy to stay away at a time like this . no wonder the police think he has something to do with it .	what do you think ?
oh , i know he did n't , but i wish i could find him ... i have something very important to tell him . macaulay wo n't help at all . he thinks i just want money .	well , do n't you ?
nick , you will help me find clyde -- wo n't you ?	now , mimi , there are a thousand detectives in new york . hire one of them .
but he knows you . all you have to do is get in touch with him , and tell him that mimi says everything is all right ... but that i 've got to see him .	i tell you again , i do n't want any part of it . now you take dorothy home and ...
dorothy ! is she here ?	yes ...
where 's gilbert ?	gilbert ! is he here too ? we might as well be living in the lobby .
chris may be at the club -- or somewhere -- i do n't see that it 's important --	you should have told them he 'd disappeared .
but he has nothing to do with it !	that 's not for you to decide . everybody 's under suspicion - especially running off like this -- the police will want his description . is this a picture of him ?
i tell you -- he did n't do it .	they 'll want more than your word for that .
this is all very pleasant but why are here ?	i 've got some very important news - i 've seen wynant .
you did ... where ?	last night . he came to see me at my apartment .
oh , did he ? what did he say ?	he did n't say very much . wanted to know how i was and how the children were .
because i do n't believe that clyde 's dead ! why , you said yourself you saw him last night .	so i did . i saw him lying buried in his shop .
perfectly absurd .	and the murderer is right here in this room tonight ... he 's sitting at this table . you may serve the fish .
nobody told me . i did see him !	what did he pay you , mimi , to stick to that story ?
it is n't a story - it 's true . i did see wynant . he 's not dead .	you 're lying , mimi . but then , you 'd do anything for money . you 're getting a good price for saying you saw wynant and you figure you wo n't get anything if he 's dead .
i 'm lot going to stay here to be insulted -	macaulay , you drew up wynant 's will . mimi was cut off , was n't she , if she re-married ?
i got ta talk to you . i want you to tell me something and i want you to give it to me straight . get me ?	do you mind putting that gun away ? my wife does n't care , but i 'm in a delicate condition .
i 've never heard about you .	i did n't knock julia off .
all right - you did n't .	i have n't seen her in three months . we were all washed up .
why tell me ?	i would n't have any reason to hurt her . she was always on the up and up with me . but that dirty little nunheim -- he got sore cause i clicked with her and he did n't , so he put the finger on me .
that 's all swell . only you 're peddling your fish in the wrong market . i 've got nothing to do with it .	listen . `` studsy '' burke told me you used to be o.k . that 's why i 'm here . do they ... .
how is studsy ? i did n't know he was out of stir .	he 's all right . he 'd like to see you . but listen ... what 's the law doing to me ? do they think i did it , or is it just something else to pin on me ?
i 'd tell you if i knew . but i 'm not in this . ask the police .	that 'd be very smart . that 'd be the smartest thing i ever did . me that a police captain 's been in a hospital three weeks on account we had an argument . the boys would like to have me come in and ask questions . they 'd like it right down to the end of their blackjacks . now i come to you on the level . studsy says you 're on the level . be on the level .
what 's that ?	this is your party .
morelli - you knew julia . was she gypping wynant ?	she do n't say she is , but i figure she is -
why do you say that ?	once i wanted five grand -- cash -
what am i ? the fall guy ?	i hope you wo n't let this news spoil your dinner . nice food , is n't it ?
so it 's you he was after !	hello , baby .
he 's dragged me into every gin mill on the block .	i had him out this morning .
i thought so . he even tried to drag me into the gentlemen 's --	oh , this is andy --
you might have mentioned me first .	he 's well-trained . he 'll behave himself .
pretty girl .	if you like 'em like that .
you got types ?	only you , darling ... lanky brunettes with wicked jaws .
who is she ?	i was hoping i would n't have to tell you . dorothy is really my daughter . you see , it was spring in venice , and i was so young . i did n't know what i was doing . we were all like that on my father 's side .
by the way , how is your father 's side ?	much better , thanks .
how many drinks have you had ?	six martinis .
what hit me ?	that last martini .
i ca n't lie here . i 've got to get up and trim that darned christmas tree .	take it easy .
who 's that ?	santa claus .
come on -- relax -- give them a drink .	we need ice .
i 'd better order some food . that sounds like an interesting case . would n't you like to take it ?	i have n't the time . i 'm much too busy seeing that you do n't lose any of the money i married you for .
sounds like a good case . girl mysteriously murdered . no one knows who did it . they have n't found any clues yet -- no gun -- no fingerprints --	i wonder if they 've -- i do n't want to hear anything about it .
is n't that my drink ?	what are you drinking ?
where did you get that ?	she brought it in . trying to make me believe she did it .
what are you going to do with it ?	nothing , 'til i find out if it 's the gun julia wolf was killed with . keep her in here , and do n't let those reporters see her . they might believe her .
she did n't tell me a thing .	too bad you did n't bring your whip .
nick ! nick ! are you asleep ?	yes .
good . i want to talk to you .	that 's jolly .
do n't you think you 'd like to go back to detecting once in a while , just for the fun of it ?	ca n't you get to sleep ?
no .	maybe a drink would help you .
no thanks .	maybe it would if i took it .
everybody says you were a grand detective .	they were kidding you .
i 'd like to see you work .	tomorrow i 'll buy you a whole lot of detective stories .
that poor girl is in a tough spot .	there 's nothing i can do to help her .
she thinks you can . it would n't hurt you to find out if you could , would it ?	darling , my guess is that wynant killed julia and dorothy knows it . and the police 'll catch him without my help .
i think i would like that drink . i 'll give you your christmas present now if you 'll give me mine .	at breakfast .
but it 's christmas now .	breakfast .
what are you going to give me ? i hope i do n't like it .	you 'll have to keep them anyway . the man at the aquarium said that he would n't take them back .
nick ! nick ! there 's someone to she you ,	that 's great . i was afraid i 'd have to go to sleep .
you idiot ! asta ! stop that ! get down ! now , stay there .	all right ... shoot ! i mean ... what 's on your mind ?
it 's all right . it just grazed me .	someone get a doctor .
there 's one coming .	well , quick -- get into bed . are you all right ?
sure -- i do n't even feel it .	i 'll get some towels .
i 'll be all right . do n't let 's fuss till the doctor comes .	want a drink ?
i wish that doctor 'd come . how do you feel ?	he 'll be here . give him time to get his trousers on . where 's asta ? asta ! asta !
you 're a fine watch dog .	he 's got more sense than you have . thank heaven you 're not on this case .
on it ! i 'm in it ... they think i did it !	well , did n't you ?
i never saw that before .	no . it 's a christmas present .
who gave it to you ?	you did .
finished with these ?	yes . i know all they know about the murder . and i 'm a great hero . the tribune said i was shot twice .
i read you were shot five times in the tabloids .	that 's not true . he never came near my tabloids . that 's one thing i always protect ... my tabloids .
hello ... send him up .	who 's that ?
are n't you hot in that ?	i 'm stifling , but it 's so pretty . the kirbys .
is that another christmas present ?	yes .
did i give it to you ?	yes .
nick , listen . from clyde wynant ! `` will you take charge of investigation on julia wolf murder . communicate with herbert macaulay '' .	let 's see . where 's it from ?
philadelphia . then he did n't do it , did he , nick ?	i do n't know .
he would n't ask you to handle it if he were guilty .	your guess is as good as mine .
oh , it 's a fire hydrant .	yes . it 's asta 's christmas present .
well , that 's that . stay there , nick !	it 's not going to hurt me to get up .
sit down !	you talk as if i were asta .
what 's the trouble , asta ? your balloon busted ? so 's mine .	what 's the matter with you ?
the mystery 's all gone . and i wanted you to find out who did it .	maybe i will .
but wynant -- - ?	i do n't believe he did it .
why do n't you ?	no reason . just a hunch . but i 'm going to find out . i 'm tired of being pushed around .
so am i .	come on , watson , we 're going places .
this may be a little rough - you 'd better let us go alone .	catch me letting you go alone !
i wish they 'd stop that . it makes me fidgety . do you think they 'll find him , nick ? he must be in new york ... . where do you think you 're going ?	i 'm going to take asta for a walk .
he 's just been for a walk .	we 're going sightseeing -- are n't we , asta ?
what 's that ? what are you up to ? nickie - what is this ?	looks like a hold-up !
what are you going to do ?	i 've got hunch . i 'm going down to look at wynant 's shop , i want to find out why it 's closed .
why should n't be close it ? he went away .	he went away lots of times when i knew him - but he never closed his shop . i 've got a hunch something is up .
you mean , he might be hiding there ?	i do n't know ... this thing has got my goat . i 've got to find out .
nick - i wo n't have you going down there .	say you 're the one who got me in this !
i know but this is different . he 's a crazy man . he might kill you .	i 'll be all right . i 've got asta to protect me .
go on - go on - see if i care . but it 's a dirty trick bringing me all the way to new york just to make me a widow .	you would n't be a widow long .
you bet i would n't .	not with all your money !
you dog !	goodbye , darling .
nickie , take care of yourself wo n't you ?	sure i will .
do n't say it that way . say it as if you meant it .	why , i believe the little woman cares .
back to california	my soul , woman . i give you three murders and you are n't satisfied .
i want you to stay and find wynant .	i did find him !
what do you mean ?	he was down in the shop .
nick !	it was his body that was buried there .
nick , you 'd better lay off that liquor .	that 's a fact .
wynant 's body ?	yup . do n't you want something to eat ?
but they all said it was rosebreen 's .	that 's what they think ... guild and all of them . they take it for granted that it 's just another of wynant 's victims . guild 's hot-footing it around now , looking for wynant . that 's all that troubles him .
what makes you so sure it 's wynant 's body ?	several things . hello , fred . we 're hungry again . yeah , and lots of onions . oh , and coffee .
nick , you 'll drive me crazy . what things ?	huh ?
what things made you so sure ?	oh . well , the clothes for instance . they were carefully preserved , and the body was just as carefully destroyed . the person who killed him counted on one thing ... that all skeletons look alike .
well , do n't they ?	sure .
you do n't get another swallow 'til you really open up .	i remembered that wynant had some shrapnel in his shin . it often bothered him . so i looked for it and i found it . gim me .
how long has he been dead ?	couple of months anyway .
then he could n't have committed those other murders .	smart gal .
wynant dead ? does dorothy know ?	no . nobody but you .
i 'm going to tell her .	hey ... hey . do n't do that .
but the poor kid 's going crazy . she 'd rather know her father was dead than that ...	i ca n't help it . i ca n't tell a soul . i did n't even tell guild .
why not ?	i want to lie low till i get the whole dope . i do n't want to go off half-cocked .
what are you going to do ?	i 'm going to get the real murderer . i 've got an idea . want to see me take him ?
yes !	got a nice evening dress ?
now nick , what 's that got to do with it ?	got a nice evening dress ?
i 've got a lulu -- why ?	i 'm going to give a party , and invite all of the suspects .
the suspects ! they wo n't come .	oh , they 'll come . i 'll have guild issue the invitations .
who do you think did it ?	mimi ...
mimi !	mimi , jorgensen , morelli , tanner ... ..
you give such charming parties , mr. charles .	thank you , mrs. charles .
i ca n't wait any longer . tell me , do you think one of them did it ?	yes .
i wish you 'd tell me who .	i wish you 'd tell me .
serve the nuts - i mean , serve the guests the nuts .	i 'm afraid you 're lying , mimi . you see , i really did see wynant last night .
you 're going to drive me crazy !	let 's see ... where was i ? oh , yes . he went to find the man . that man was desperate ! he knew that he was caught dead to rights -- and with prison staring him in the face , he took the only way out . he killed wynant . it 's terrible to tell you this way but your father 's dead , dorothy .
if that knife is missing , i 'll look for it in your back .	after our hero had killed wynant , he got a brilliant idea . he realized that he and julia could still collect money . wynant was supposed to be on a trip - no one knew where - so our dinner guest wrote letters to macaulay , signing wynant 's name , so that macaulay would continue to send the money to julia . he even telephoned macaulay -- do you remember ? ... . the first day that you came to see me ... he telephoned that he was in town ?
is that true ?	i do n't know .
why are you saying it ?	it 's the only way it makes sense .
i hope you 're well .	his plan was still working beautifully . wynant was established as being in town . the watch chain was handed over ... . ... with a slight delay ... to the police . the only hitch was a man named nunheim who had found out something . our hero paid nunheim once to keep his mouth shut , and when nunheim threatened him again , he bumped him off .
come on out , now . he wo n't hurt you . back to your old tricks , eh , tanner ?	no , mr. charles .
how did you get in here ?	i had a key . i worked here ... till they closed the shop .
you worked here ?	yes , sir . julia wolf got me a job as bookkeeper .
well , that 's a hot one . you a bookkeeper ! when were you ever a bookkeeper ?	that time you sent me up last ... i learned book-keeping at sing sing . i figured it might be an in for me somewhere 's .
somewhere 's where they might go out and leave the safe open ?	honest , mr , charles . i never touched that safe . them bonds that were missing ... julia took them .
trying to put it off on her ?	mr. charles - she did - that 's why he got sore at her and killed her . listen , mr. charles -- i did do a little chiseling . i come to bring it back and fix up the books . i did n't want him to find out and come after me -
you can save that and tell it to the police . they 'll be here in a minute .	police !
i 'm sorry . tanner , do n't you want some wine ?	no ... no .
that 's what mr. wynant said to me . if she re-married , all the money was to go to the children .	you should n't let that keep you from telling truth , mimi . mrs. jorgensen - were you ever divorced from chris jorgensen ?
nick charles here ?	yes . nick !
you his wife ?	yes .
was he a good detective ?	i would n't know . that time he caught me was a accident . i led with my right .
well , congratulations .	i 'm going to give her a wedding present . thought i 'd better do it now , before i forget it . i can drop them on my way to ... that 's funny ... . where are those bonds ?
bonds , sir ?	i know i left them there .
maybe miss wolf has them .	maybe she has .
you 're forgetting the check for your suitcase . it 's at the grand central .	oh , yes -- yes -- that 's right --
i 'm sorry ... but ...	two weeks work gone for nothing .
i just wanted to tell you ...	i do n't care what you wanted to tell me . you 're through ! get your things and get out !
where are you going ?	home !
home ?	i 'm fired .
who fired you ?	you did .
you speak english ? do you speak english ! ?	y-yes .
where were you going ?	baghdad .
what 's in the other direction ?	this road , it leads straight to kuwait .
turn the car around .	please , i beg of you . the american army is there . i am iraqi . they will kill me .
think we 're going to do it ? think we 're going to war ?	not up to us . up to the iraqis . all they have to do is get out of kuwait .
... and it 's very important when you sit down never to point the soles of your shoes at anyone . it 's considered offensive .	you know so much about the middle east , you know where we can get something to eat .
like learning arabic ? you 're gon na learn arabic you might as well learn were we can get something to eat around here .	i did n't learn arabic because we were getting shipped here . you do n't learn it in a couple of weeks . i studied it in high school .
well , based on my knowledge of the region , its culture and her people i would have to say it 's a box .	can you eat it ? if you ca n't eat it i really do n't care what it is .
paper .	it 's a fortune box .
what 's it say ?	help , i 'm being held prisoner in a puzzle box factory .
it 's a map , i think that 's what it is .	there you go , jaeger . just find the buried treasure , and you 're a millionaire .
a casual one .	damn , this is sweet . we are going to be home in no time .
you 're out of your minds , you know that ? both of you . you do n't even know if there 's anything out there . what the hell are you thinking ?	i 'm thinking about when this war is over . why you figure i 'm here ? 'cause i got tired of being president of gm ? if a brother does n't play ball , or deal drugs there are n't too many big money prospects around , and i 'm not particularly interested in spending the rest of my life fighting the oil companies ' wars . so i say if maybe there 's something out there , what the hell , that 's what i say .
yeah ! welcome to beautiful iraq . land of enchantment and riches .	oh , god .
what ?	i know you think this is crazy , but a couple of hours from now you 're going to be one rich dude trying to buy up every other puzzle box out there .
why , yes , jaeger . i believe it is .	no , please , not again .
what are we going to do ! ?	we 're going to keep driving .
they stopped .	wha ...
they should n't have been here .	we should n't have been here , epps . there is a war going on !
this is miles from the battle lines . they were probably deserters .	deserters would have run , they would n't have engaged .
what are you doing .	low on gas . got to refill .
you two fighting 's not going to get us anything .	him getting us stranded out here does n't do much good either .
maybe we are crazy for doing this . but if we do it , we do it right . i just needed to explain that in a way i would n't have to do it again .	not much chance of that . jaeger 's an idiot .
he 's not so --	he 's an idiot , and he 's not nearly as hard as he thinks .
what kind of mine ?	i do n't know , and i was n't about to mess with it .
should have blown already . delayed fuse , that 's vietnam stuff .	maybe that 's all the iraqis could afford , okay ? maybe they got it on discount . maybe the fuse is messed up . or maybe it 's going to go off in two seconds , and we wo n't have to worry about getting jaeger down off there , all we 'll have to worry about is finding the pieces .
we 've got rope ?	for climbing .
what if it 's a valloro 69 ? just going to bounce right up out of the ground , explode in the air , kill him and us .	you just go when i say go .
ready ?	yeah .
all right . let 's get out of here .	the soldiers are going to kill those people !
there 's nothing we can do .	we can fight . that 's what we 're here for : to fight the iraqis . to help the shi'ites , and the khurds .
i do n't want to see people killed any more than you . but we try to help out we die , and all we do is die .	we ca n't just go off and --
all we 've got to do is make it to the top .	and find the treasure , and get it , and get back to the humvee , and get the hell out of iraqi without getting our heads blown off , but that 's about it .
not much of a pass .	probably was a couple of hundred years ago when whoever drew the map came through here . worn down to nothing now .
the us army : always an adventure .	let me see the map .
should be easy going from here . stay on the pass straight to the dot .	what do you figure it to be ?
otherwise whatever we 're looking for could be anywhere .	basically . but the map has been pretty precise so far . i do n't think it 'll be too hard to --
where 'd they go ?	i do n't know . there 's a lot of space up here . they could be just about --
and they ca n't fly around out there forever .	so we wait .
missile !	move !
all right . let 's break out some utility shovels , lanterns , and a claymore in case we have to do any blasting . me and jaeger 'll climb down , and see what we can see .	what am i supposed to do ?
epps !	i heard !
i do n't think the line will take the weight of a man and the coins . wes ! ? we 'll send the gold up , then me and jaeger 'll climb back .	ready when you are .
you ready ?	all right . i 'll go up , then you send up the gold and --
it 'll be too dark to make our way back now . let 's bed down for the night and head out at first light .	what about the gold ?
what about it ?	maybe we should split it up now .
we started this together , and we 're staying together , so there 's no point in splitting things up now .	what if we get separated ? way i see it if something happens i want to be carrying my share .
you 're the one with all the ideas .	you 've had your say , wes . now leave it .
maybe you 've got ideas of your own for the gold . maybe you 've already got things worked out .	maybe i do .
you got no reason to do that !	i told you : when i straighten someone out they stay straightened . this is how it works : nobody touches the gold . except when we 're on the move and someone 's carrying it , nobody so much as opens the pack to get an eyeful of it . agreed ?
you got no reason to hit me . i 'm getting tired of you and jaeger pushing me around .	then get up and do something about it .
get off him .	he snuck in here thinking we were asleep , only i was n't sleeping . would have slit our throats if i had n't stopped him .
what happened ?	i told you . he tried to steal our gold . he tried to kill us .
stop it !	i told you ; do n't push me around .
says they were deserters , they were afraid to fight , do n't believe in saddam anyway . they flew the gunship up here to hide out . when they saw us they figured we were going to kill them , so they shot first .	why 'd he come in our camp .
says he wanted food . liar . he wanted the gold .	how 's he going to want the gold ? he could n't even know we had it .
i do n't care what he says , he wanted our gold . would have slit our throats if he had the chance .	does n't matter . whatever he wanted he did n't get it . we 've got no need staying around here . it 's light enough . let 's pack up and head out .
we ca n't just leave him . he 'll run back to his outfit , report our position ...	you said he was a deserter .
that 's what he says . he could be a spy , or something .	you do n't know that .
you 're out of your mind .	he 's an enemy soldier .
i 'm not going to let you kill him .	we 're at war .
we are not at war ! you and i and jaeger are awol . we have no authority --	he tried to kill us . if not just now , then in the helicopter . that 's all the authority i need .
i 'm not going to leave him be just so he can stab us in the backs the minute we turn around . i have been through too much to lose it all now just because the two of you do n't have the stomach to do what has to be done .	i 've got no stomach for murder .
it 's a combat action .	it 's murder , and i wo n't be any part of it .
then step aside .	no .
you 've got an awful lot of orders in you . always giving orders .	i out rank you , that 's why .
we been down this road . i told you how it is . unless you feel like there 's something you want to do about it ...	what if i do ?
no navicom . a lot of good you are now , epps .	lot of good you were when i was sinking in the sand .
without that navicam looks to me like you forfeit the right to be in charge .	and let me guess who is .
i 'm the one 's got the big stick .	suppose i do n't go for that ?
then i suppose it 'd be insurrection , and i suppose i 'd have to kill you . i suppose .	what about jaeger ?
in the flack jacket . still like getting hit in the back with a baseball bat . took the air right out of me , but i was just unconscious for awhile . 'course , you did n't stick around to find that out . you left me for dead .	we thought --
wes , we thought you were dead , and we thought we were next . hanging around to get killed would n't have done anyone any good .	sure , and i guess it was just convenient there was one less person to split the gold with .
wes --	look , i know you guys are telling the truth . it 's just the shi'ites do n't know that . i guess you could tell them ... but then you do n't speak the language do you ?
thanks for taking care of this for me .	tell me something , wes . are you crazy , greedy , or just stupid ? jaeger says you 're crazy .
you disappoint me , epps . always figured you to be a man ; a real bright guy . i had respect for you .	that why you tried to put a bullet in my head in the middle of the desert .
they 'll kill you . you wo n't make it ten feet before they cut you down .	you do n't know john epps very well , do you ?
just keep quiet .	i have to answer him .
so you can give us away ?	if i do n't answer , he 'll know something 's up .
give it to me !	if i give it to you , will you let us go ?
looks like at the end of the day we finally find out who 's better than who , do n't we , epps ? like i said ; i expected more from you .	it 's like i said ; you do n't really know lieutenant john epps very well , do you ?
at-at-at-at-at . at-at-at-at-at .	what are you doing ?
at-at-at-at-at .	knock it off !
do n't get pissed at me , just 'cause i want to be ready when this war starts .	ready for what ? what are you supposed to be doing ?
i told you , i 'm shooting iraqis .	no you 're not .
you know what ? i think you got schwarzkopf . you did ! you got the general right in the ass . now that 's good shooting .	blow me .
do n't worry about jaeger . he uses his personality as a form of birth control .	blow me . have i said that to you guys recently ? blow me .
oh , man , you 're not going to fall for that .	there might be something in there .
yeah , the deed to the brooklyn bridge .	there might be .
this is stupid . it 's going on a month now . how long are they going to let the air force piss on those bastards ? they can bomb them all they want , saddam ai n't going anywhere without a ground assault . what the hell is the army waiting for ?	why you in such a hurry to get to shooting ?
you all want to lay off ? god . i hope the iraqis shoot me ; put me out of my misery .	oh my god !
what ! ? what ! ?	i did it ! i got the box open .
you think ?	yeah , that 's exactly what i think . you and the five thousand other suckers who bought those boxes . let 's get out of here . we got sand to protect .
they finally start the ground war , and where are we ? same place we 've been since we got here . securing freedom for the dirt .	everybody 's got a job to do . figure it this way : at least you get to go home alive .
do n't even . you 're not going to show me that tired map .	wait . wait .
i think you 've got some issues to deal with . really , when we get out of here i 'm pretty sure it 's shrink time for you .	just listen to me ! i 've been doing some reading . in the sixteenth century this region was invaded by the turks . it became part of the ottoman empire . when the turks rolled in they raped , they pillaged , the usual stuff . anybody who had anything wanted to hide it from these bastards . they buried their treasures , drew maps , and hid the maps in puzzle boxes . i read about this , man . i read about it .
wellllll , if you read it it must be true . was it in the star , or the enquirer ?	christ ! wes , tell him . you know this stuff .
and you know what that area is ? it 's iraq . iraq ! we 're doing a little thing with them right now ; desert storm . maybe you 've read about it .	what we 're doing is kicking ass . for god 's sake they got iraqis surrendering to news crews . the war is over . we 've just got to keep shooting people 'cause the army spent all this money , and we 've got to put on a show for the taxpayers .
it 's war . people get lost all the time in war , cut off --	we disappear for awhile . we disappear , we came back ; nobody knows nothing .
it 's going to be cool , wes . it 's all all right .	we go , we get rich , we go home . it 's that easy .
now this is war .	roger that .
you 're such a pussy , you know that ? how 'd you get in the army ?	cool it , jaeger . hey , wes ? wes ?
but that 's the great thing about gold . a little goes a long way .	you know what i 'm doing with my part of the gold ?
third . what you 're going to do with your third .	yeah . i meant ... you know what i 'm going to do with it ? i 'm going to buy a sixty- three 'vette stingray . all tricked out and cherry . i 'm going to be so sweet .
you 're getting gold , and you 're going to blow it on wheels ?	what are you going to do with your < u > third < /u > ?
invest it .	oh , that 's fun .
it 's not about being fun . it 's about being smart . you take that money , you take care of it , let it grow , and you do n't ever have to do anything again . ever . that 's freedom . that 's what i 'm talking about .	and i 'm talking about enjoying myself .
take the binoculars .	wh-what do you think --
shut up ! both of you shut the hell up !	we 've got to do something . we 've got to turn around .
they 'll shoot us !	we run they 'll shoot us anyway . if we keep driving they might think we friendlies ; iraqis . or even if they know we 're americans they might get scared , think we 're part of a detachment and keep on going .
they 're not going to --	it 's the only way . we drive !
figure they do n't want to mess with us anymore than we want to mess with them .	look at you , not even breaking a sweat . you 're cool , boy . you 're cool .
steady it out !	i steady it out , they blow us out of the sand !
she okay ?	yeah . yeah , she 's fine .
what ?	i 'm just thinking , you know , if the rest of the boys knew what we 're doing . i mean if they knew what we were coming back with .
you ca n't tell anybody about this .	i know . i know . but i 'm saying , if they knew . we 're going to be millionaires , man . millionaires !
it 'd make their heads explode .	millionaires , man .
look at it . look at it ! shot to hell . it 's been leaking gas since the fire fight . i told you to check for damage .	... i know .
and you missed this ? how are you going to miss something like this ?	i did n't miss it . i figured if you knew one of the reserves got hit you 'd want to turn back .
what do we do with the humvee ?	we leave it .
say it !	i got that ... sir .
hey ... hey ! slow up . you do n't have to go so fast .	faster we get there , faster we get back .
i 'm gon na ... i 'm just gon na stop for a little water .	do n't drink up all of yours , 'cause you are n't getting any of ours .
what ! ?	mine .
what ?	mine . land mine !
you did n't step on any mine .	i heard it click .
if you stepped on a mine you 'd be dead by now . nobody uses delayed-fuse mines anymore .	i heard it .
oh , god ! oh god !	just be cool .
it 's a mine , is n't it ?	just relax .
how 'm i gon na relax standing on a mine ! ?	we 're going to get off , all right . we 'll get you off of there . just ... be cool .
where you going ?	me and wes are just going to talk .
why you got to move away to talk ! ?	we 're going to be right over here .
you 're moving away because it 's going to blow up , is n't it ! ? it 's going to blow up !	i said be cool , all right ? now be cool !
there 's a way .	epps ...
i said nobody dies . nobody dies .	epps , my leg is falling asleep .
my leg is falling asleep .	it 's not falling asleep . you 've only been standing there for three minutes .
i 'm the one who can feel my leg , and it 's falling asleep .	it falls asleep and you die , so wake it the hell up .
how 's this going to work ?	me and wes each going take an end of the rope , run our asses of , and yank you off the mine .
you 're going to be fine .	you 're not going to let me die , are you ! ? do n't let me die !
when we start running suck up your breath . you 're going to get the wind knocked out of you .	do n't let me die , epps . i do n't want to die .
you 're going to blow yourselves up .	wes is right . if there were any more mines we would have found them . hell , that one you stepped on was probably old anyway ; left over from the war with iran .
you do n't know that . it could be a trick .	if we step on a mine we 'll know it was . let me see the maps .
this . whatever it is .	it 's the treasure , that 's what it is .
you 're not losing trust , are you ?	just figure it 's my map , i ought to hang on to it .
i did n't have to stop anything , 'cause nobody was going to do nothing . we 're in this together , understand ?	yeah , i understand . wes does n't want to come along in the first place , but he gets a third of the find . that 's a sweet deal .
i do n't hear any --	shut up and listen !
do n't !	it 's a fire fight .
iraqis . a bunch of them .	what are they doing here ?
well , it 's iraq . i 'm not sure , but i 'm guessing that has something to do with them being here .	what are they doing in the middle of nowhere ?
they 're doing more than slapping .	the shi'ites are on our side ? i did n't know that .
not enough . we 're out numbered and out gunned . they 'd cut us to shreds .	so good bye , shi'ites . thanks for playing . we have some lovely parting gifts for you as you go .
x marks the spot .	something like that .
but the white dot in the middle ; that 's got to mean something .	i hope it means something , otherwise ...
where is it ? where 'd it go ?	stay low .
where the hell is it ! ?	just stay down .
what are we going to do ? what the hell are we going to do ?	we 're not going to do anything .
they 're going to kill us !	they ca n't shoot us in here .
if they land --	if they land , we can take them . if they do n't land , then we 've got nothing to worry about .
think there might be more iraqis ?	right now i would n't be surprised if eartha kitt showed up singing send in the clowns .
a whole lot of nothing .	so where do we start ?
what are you doing ?	what does it look like i 'm doing ?
it looks like you 're not doing anything .	i 'm not . and i 'm not doing anything , because there 's nothing down here .
get up and dig .	we 've been digging . we 've been digging for hours . if there was anything here to find we would have found it .
must be a compartment .	i feel air . probably opens up outside somewhere . that 's where the light comes from . could n't see it with the lanternon .
maybe we should blast it loose with the claymore .	it 's giving .
it 's just a mongoose .	is it dead ?
it 's not like i figured . it 's cold . and it 's heavier than i imagined .	i would n't know . i never imagined this . not in my whole life did i ever imagine this .
wait .	what ?
what ?	we send the gold up what 's to stop him from taking off and leaving us down here ?
he 's not going to leave us .	what 's to stop him if he wanted to ? all he has to do is cut the line ...
why do i have to stay down here ?	jesus , jaeger .
i do n't see how that plan 's any better .	someone 's got to send the gold up . it ca n't get on the line by itself .
all right . you go up , i 'll send up the gold , then follow .	yeah . yeah , that 'll work .
what the hell took so long .	just had to get the pack unhooked from the line . it did n't seem that long .
wes might be right about that .	it stays as it is . we 're halfway home now . let 's not blow it by people getting ideas .
we should head northeast .	northeast ? that 's away from the hummer ; further into iraqi .
there 's another pass on the photo . we can avoid that narrow one we had to cross on the way up , and it should get us back down .	it should , or it will ? least going back the way we came we know what we 're up against .
what are we going to do ? how are we going to find our way back ! ?	we 'll find our way .
how ! ?	we 'll find our way ! we 'll ...
we got to go back . we got to go back for wes .	forget wes .
we ca n't just leave him .	wes is dead !
what if he 's not ?	then he will be when those iraqis get to him . he was going to kill you . he was one blink away from it . he 's dead , epps , and i 'm sure as hell not getting my head blow off over his carcass .
no .	we need something : a flare , a signal mirror .
no .	what do you mean no ? they can fly us home .
they 'll ask questions ; want to know why we were out here .	we 'll lie .
first wes , now you ?	i 'm not like wes . wes was crazy .
and you ; you 've got it all together .	i do n't want it this way . i would n't kill you just to kill you , but i ca n't let you lose the gold for me . not when we 're so close .
i 'm sorry about that , epps .	is it all right if i stand up ?
i 'm glad i did n't have to kill you . i 'm glad it did n't come to that .	yeah . well , me too .
i never killed anybody before . i talk a good game , but i 'm not like that .	sure .
really , i 'm not . remember how i was talking i wanted to blow away all those iraqis ? that 's all it was was talk . i was scared out of my mind to go to war . i still have n't gotten over stepping on that land mine .	you still got a map on you ?
epps ?	yeah .
i do n't want to die .	makes two of us .
i know what i did just now was crazy , but you got to understand how much i want that gold .	it 's all right . i do n't like it , but it 's over now .
sorry .	damn .
what do you think our chances are ?	if we can find the hummer , or some friendlies by sundown we might be okay . we 've got enough water for that . but we wo n't make another day otherwise .
wonder how the war 's going ?	it 's got to be going better than this..
we ca n't just sit here . we 've got to start moving , so pick .	you sure you want me too ?
i pick that way .	okay . then we go this way .
getting cold .	it 's a desert . that 's what deserts do at night ; they get cold .
epps ... epps ! i 'm gon na stop for a second .	no !
just let me rest for a second .	we 've got to keep moving while there 's still light .
you know what i 'm going to do ? i 'm just going to take a second . i want to look at the gold .	do n't you touch it .
i just want to look at it . remind me of what i 'm dying for .	the deal was no one touches it until we get out of here .
what do you figure it is ?	place all alone like that ? must be a boarder check point .
which boarder ? saudi ? kuwait ? syria ?	could n't be syria . we could n't have gone that far north . it 's got to be saudi . come on .
we can head back for our lines , and they do n't even have to know about the gold .	epps . what if they 're not saudi .
well ?	well , we should identify ourselves .
even if they are iraqis probably all they 'll do is take us prisoner for awhile . got to figure we 're still kicking their asses in the war . they do n't want any trouble .	hell , they 'll probably just surrender to us . probably .
that 's if the war is even still going on . way things were shaping up it 's probably long over .	probably .
what did you say ?	i do n't know . something wes had taught me . i think it means `` do n't shoot . we 're your friends . ''
oh , god ...	they must have thought we were iraqi when you yelled to them . they could n't tell in the dark .
slip out your m-16 .	and then what ?
and then shoot them .	i ... i never killed anyone before . i told you that .
ca n't you --	i do n't have a weapon .
do n't go bitch on me now ! you were going to kill me . kill them !	i just said i would . i do n't think i --
an iraqi ?	i do n't know . he did n't have a uniform on . he ... he had on white robes , like the guys who killed wes .
what do we do ?	we ca n't stay here . even if that was n't an iraqi soldier it 's only a matter of time before some show up . get all the water you can carry , and we 'll head out on foot .
to where ?	sun rises in the east . we go the opposite direction . may not find anything , but at least we 'll know we 're heading towards saudi arabia .
what do we do ?	we keep going , that 's what we do . we ignore them , maybe they ignore us .
what do you make of them ?	shi'ites , i think .
is that good , or bad ?	i do n't know . they killed wes .
why have n't they killed us ! ?	i do n't know !
... maybe ... maybe we can fight our way out .	with what ? against how many ?
we ca n't just sit here waiting to die .	you come up with a better plan , let me know .
... wes ... ?	you were shot . we were standing right there , you were shot !
i did n't say that . i never said --	me ? i say you do n't have enough brains to be stupid .
can you ride a horse ?	no , but i figure now 's a real good time to start .
which way do we go ! ?	we go this way .
damn it . we lost the horses .	the ... the gold ...
it was n't the gold . it was the claymore mine . the gold 's in my pack .	when did you make the switch ?
it 's always been like that . when you left me down in the crevice to send the gold up i figured i 'd better ... take precautions . i rigged it to blow if anyone opened the pack . just in case somebody thought they could do better on their own .	but ...
we had a deal . no one touches the gold until we 're out of here . no one breaks the deal , no one had anything to worry about .	what if it had n't been wes ? what if ... i mean , accidently , what if i had ...
well ?	a car 's got to come along sooner or later . when it does , we jack it .
how do we do that ?	you lie in the middle of the road , look like you 're hurt . when the car stops i run over to the driver and put a gun to his head .
why do i have to lie in the road ?	somebody has to .
yeah , but why me ? what if the car does n't stop ?	then i 'm a rich man .
epps .	yeah .
i want you to know ... i do n't know . i just think you 're a hell of a guy .	thanks .
this whole time , you 've kept your head . you did n't go money simple like me and wes . you 've just been trying to figure how to get us out of here . and you 've been fair too . i mean , even after i ... you know ...	threatened to blow my brains out ?
yeah . even after that . you did n't take it out on me , except for maybe making me lie in the middle of the road now . but i 'd say you 've been very fair . i just think it 's a hell of a man who can keep from going money simple .	do n't make so much out of it . only reason i have n't figured a way to get all that money for myself is because i 've been too busy figuring ways to stay alive . believe me ; if i had a minute to catch my breath i might have played things the way you and wes had . i 'm no better than anybody else . i 've just been busier .
epps ?	what ?
i 'm thinking about taking a trip .	thought you were going to buy a car .
still am . there 's more gold than i thought , and since there 's only two of us now ... where should i go ?	i do n't know .
i 've never been anywhere . i would n't know where to go . where would you go ?	how the hell should i know ?
australia .	what ?
i 'd go to australia . lot of land , not many people . i think after this i 'd like to quit people for awhile . and the girls go crazy for brothers down there .	really ?
well , this is it . we get the car , find some americans . we find americans we 'll be all right .	we 'll make up some kind of lie . they wo n't find the gold .
epps , i do n't think he 's slowing down .	he 'll slow down .
he 's not slowing .	he 's going to slow down .
woods .	hey , jaeger . what 's up .
i 'm looking for a favor . i need a map of iraqi .	a map ? all i got is maps . i 'm gon na have delayed map syndrome when i finally get out of here . what kind of map you need ? topographical , geographical , thermal ?
that should n't be too hard to read . iraq is the pink thing .	i could use some recon photos too .
planning on going to war all by your lonesome ?	just ... want to be ready when we do .
ready for what ? sight-seeing ?	the photos .
some good ones .	they 're all good ones . satellites we 've got can snap a shot of the boil on saddam 's ass .
could you stop , please . you 're giving me a headache .	a headache ?
yeah , a headache . my head hurts . you 're making me uncomfortable .	i 'm making you uncomfortable . baking away in a desert in the middle of nowhere facing three-hundred-thousand screaming iraqis with nerve gas scud missiles , that does n't bother you . but me making a little noise is driving you out of your skull .
yes . yes . that 's exactly it . yes .	okay .
we ought to kick their asses anyway . even if they do get out of kuwait we ought to kick their asses .	i do n't think we 'll go to war . we should n't even be here . this is n't our fight , it 's a regional conflict . it should be decided regionally .
people are suffering .	people were suffering in afganistan , and we did n't do anything .
when do you ever point the soles of your feet at people ?	i 'm saying do n't do it accidently .
come on . you 're going to get us in trouble .	it was an accident . you saw it was an accident .
spanish was n't hard enough ?	i thought it would be good to know .
what does that mean ?	do n't shoot me , i 'm friendly . you can use that when you surrender .
how do you say `` come here , baby . i 'm horny . '' i can use that now .	do n't even try it . you offend a woman out here you 're in serious trouble .
what is this ?	now you need me .
he says it 's a box .	yeah , you 're funny .
it 's a puzzle box . if you can figure out how to open it there 's supposed to be a treasure inside .	for real ? a treasure ?
and you 're the guy who 's going to open it .	i could .
you get it yet ?	naw , nothing .
you will . you 'll get it .	i 'll show epps . he 'll be sorry when i get this thing open .
you really think there 's a treasure inside ?	i do n't care if there 's a lump of coal in here . i just want to be able to rub epps ' face in it when i crack this thing .
jaeger ?	what ?
you know the fifteenth is the deadline for the iraqis to get out of kuwait .	yeah . so ?
that 's in two days .	like i said ; so ?
they 're cancelling all leaves , all passes . no more drills . we stand at full ready starting --	what 's your point , wes ? you have a point ?
we 're going to war , are n't we . if they 're doing all that it must mean we 're going to war .	it does n't mean anything .
jaeger ?	what ! ?
you ever think about dying ?	come on , man . i almost had this thing open .
you ever think about it ? you ever worry ?	the only thing i worry about is how much iraqi ass i 'm going to be able to kick before this whole thing is over . the only people who i 've got anything to worry about are the poor , dumb camel jockeys who do n't know enough to get out of the way when i come rolling at them ; an m-16 in each hand , and a grenade between my teeth . now if you 'll excuse me , soldier , i 'd like to get back to my box . i 've got a treasure to find .
at-at-at-at-at .	this is so weird . it 's happening , but it 's not . it 's like a tv show , and we 're part of it .
the longer the air force hits the iraqis , the safer it'ii be for us when we have to engage .	you know what , wes ? if you get a note from your mommy they might excuse you from the war .
it 's ... it 's ... i do n't know what it is .	it 's a container . break the seal .
that 's it . it 's over . eighteen hours into the war and it 's over .	those soldiers have got loafers on . what kind of army gives their soldiers loafers ?
we ... we could go home with something else .	what ?
you 're not saying what i think you 're saying . i ca n't believe you 're even thinking it .	it 's right here . this region ; an-nagaf . i got recon photos . there 're no troops there , no fighting --
you do n't know where the iraqis have moved to . and our forces have n't even engaged the republican guard yet , we do n't know --	it 's about a hundred miles from where we are now . how long do you think it would take us to --
it 's not a hundred miles . it 's a hundred miles through three different kinds of terrain : pure desert , mountains , a river . if the map is even real .	it 's real . i 'm telling you , it 's real .
epps , you 're smarter than this . jaeger i understand , but you 're smarter .	you know it 's real . you know it 's real , and you know it 's there . you know it .
god ! i do n't believe i 'm doing this . i do n't .	yes !
we 're going to get court martialed , you know that .	hell , we 'll just buy our way out .
epps , is that a sand dune .	oh , no .
hey , wes , what kind of treasure you figure these people buried ?	if ! if there 's a treasure .
yeah . if . whatever . what kind you figure it is ?	i do n't know . it would be small , easy to transport and hide . gold or jewels . probably gold .
yeah ! gold ! how much ?	how the hell should i know how much ?
if there 's gold . if !	you know what i 'm doing with my half ?
this is too much . you do n't even have the money and you 're wasting it .	a car is not just a car where i come from . i had this friend , had this wicked candy apple red sixty-four and a half mustang --
iraqis .	oh , god !
two vehicles . they 're not supposed to be here .	oh , jesus !
yeah ! yeah !	i think i 'm going to throw up . i am . i 'm going to toss .
i thought we were dead .	yeah , well , we 're not .
we have to go back .	we 're not going anywhere . not 'til we get what we came for .
so , you just let us drive on knowing we were losing fuel ? knowing we were going to run low in the middle of nowhere ?	... i figured ... i figured you 'd turn back .
we 're not stranded . we 've got enough gas in the other reserve to get us back .	then lets go back while we still can .
you two do n't even know how crazy you are . you want to go on your sick , little treasure hunt then go ahead , but mark me absent .	you have to go with us , wes .
really ? what is that , an order , < u > private < /u > ?	you have to go with us . you ca n't walk back ...
epps ...	does n't matter . we 're not going to be able to get him off it anyway .
how long we going to keep this up .	until we 're out of the mine field is how long .
have n't found a mine for half a mile , or more .	that do n't mean nothing . iraqis could have just spread them out like that ; make us think we 're in the clear .
if all we wanted was the map out of you we could have taken it while you were standing on that mine pissing on yourself .	probably would 've too if epps was n't around to stop you .
i 'm getting tired of you riding me , jaeger .	anytime you want to do something about it just let --
jesus ! what the hell did he do that for ? they 're iraqis . why are iraqis killing iraqis ?	those people down there are shi'ites . you 've got shi'ites in the south of iraq and khurds in the north . neither of them 've got much love for saddam . probably figured once the war started there might be an uprising , so he sent his soldiers out to slap them around some .
is there anything you do know ?	i know you 're a pussy . i know that .
so ?	we have to do something .
we 're american soldiers . we do n't abandon people .	funny you should say that while we 're out looking for gold .
you 're the one wanted to kill iraqis so bad .	i 've got a new agenda now , it 's get rich . the only way the iraqis figure into that is not at all .
think we can make it ?	we make it , or we go back empty handed .
maybe they 're as scared of us as we are of them .	just seems weird they did n't chase us .
what do you think ?	lines up with the map and the photos .
it 's got a bottom .	guess we know what the next stop is .
you down ?	yeah , we 're down .
what the hell are you doing ! ?	i think we found something .
with what ? he does n't have a weapon .	he 's a soldier . he does n't need a weapon . he 's got rocks . he 's got bare hands .
says he 's one of the soldiers that was in the helicopter .	he lived through that ?
maybe we should give him some water .	all last night he could have been --
i think he wants something to drink .	i 'm not wasting my water on him .
so we 'll take him with us . at least 'til we get back to the hummer .	he 'd just slow us down , and drink our water . and if we ran into any more iraqis you know he 'd sell us out .
maybe we ought to ... you know , bury him . say some words over him .	you want to say some words ?
you 're going to burn up in those .	the white reflects the sun ; it keeps you cooler . that 's why they wear them .
think the iraqi 's killed them all ?	probably shot a few . scattered the rest . murderers .
when my shi'ite friends saw that they had shot an american they were very apologetic . turns out we 've been kicking ass in this little war . they figure we 've finally gotten saddam off their backs . they brought me to their camp , cleaned me up , fed me ... i 'm their new best buddy . america number one , joe . but there 's something the shi'ites ca n't figure out : they ca n't figure out why my two buddies , two fellow americans , left me out in the desert . they ca n't seem to figure out what those same two guys were doing in an iraqi outpost . it 's almost as if they were iraqi spies , or something . and i 've got to tell you they hate anything that 's got to do with the iraqis . see how i mean ?	we had to take shelter in the checkpoint . jesus , wes , i killed the iraqis in there .

what did you get ?	i have to see sen. i 've just been given a shift change .
when ?	now .
now ?	he wants me to come to his quarters .
i do n't know .	do n't go .
i have to ... he 's a g-34	you do n't have to ... i do n't trust him . you ought to file a report .
then why did you bring it up ?	i did n't . you asked me about the card . you 're going to get us into trouble .
i have n't done anything .	do n't be so sure .
i 've never been under the table before .	look , dirt !
that 's not dirt ... ca n't be dirt.. dirt is a violation .	looks like dirt .
look , food !	that 's not food . ca n't be food .
now ... now , i 'm sorry ... do n't - do n't ... .please . it 's just ... i was happy . why get me involved ? you told sen that you were n't satisfied with me .	what ? ... oh , no , thx . that 's not true . not satisfied ? thx , i need you so much .
i was so scared ... i did n't know what would happen with you ... once i started . i almost let you go on so many times . it will be worth it , together . when i was alone , i knew .	but it 's so hopeless ... you 're so beautiful .
what time is it ?	what ?
i said what time is it ? how long was i out ?	it 's 3+27 hundred

they 'll come for me right away if i 'm not there . i have to go .	do n't take anything .
i 'll try .	promise ... please do n't thx leaves the room .
what are you doing here ? is anything wrong ?	no ... .i though i 'm afraid .
you slipped on a t297 transfer just before lunch , did n't you ?	what ?
what do you think you 're doing ? you 're going to get us arrested .	but ... you ...
i ca n't go on like this . i ca n't ... . i do n't just sit around and watch people . if i make a mistake , it 's all over . you see it every day . do you want to see me taken away in pieces ?	i do n't want to lose you .
what are you doing ?	i do n't know .
if you ... .if you go back on sedation , you wo n't feel the same way about me . you 'll report me for drug evasion .	i 've got a slip movement to install on my next shift . i 'll never make it the way i am now .
i could n't turn you in , not now . i ... .i know i would n't !	you do n't know . you do n't ... .
if i take something , you suffer . if i do n't , i stuff ... .	i know you can do it without sedation , you can , i know you can .
then what ? it ca n't go on forever . you know it ca n't .	we could leave , and live in the superstructure ... .
it 's all right now , shhhh it 's all right .	do n't let them separate us .
are you all right ?	ah ugh .
they know . they 've been watching us . i can feel it .	they do n't know .
they 're watching us now .	no one can see us now we 're alone .
no ... no , no .	oh , thx ... hold me , hold me , thx holds her tightly , tears in his eyes . they kiss , and luh hides her head in thx 's chest .
it 's the end .	i 'm not afraid ... i 'm not afraid .
thx !	no ! ... no ! ...
then why are they holding us here ? why do n't they destroy us right away ? economically , it 's not sound at all . very much unlike ... .	i 've said many times before , and i guess i 'll have to repeat it again for your ...
you always manage to avoid the issue : what 's wrong with our present condition ? we 're comfortable and we have plenty of food ... i feel absolutely no threat because there is no threat . why incite trouble ? you should examine your emotions . it is senseless ...	what are you talking about ? when did you sleep last ? do you know what your trouble is ? you 're blind . you 've been here so long you ca n't see what is happening . we must unite . we need unity . we need action . ) we have come to a time when we must ... .
but we need a creative dissent . our voices are not joined in any harmonious chorus , but the differences are differences of emphasis , not of fundamentals . now , the new alignment 's greatest need is to communicate with all its elements , rather than march along in parallel line that never converge . tomorrow as we focus the new movement more clearly , we will gain a new unity .	what ?

i thought you were through with it !	we can not stay here and allow ourselves to be destroyed . you can work with us . an organized plan of escape must be devised first . could you see anything ? you want to leave . you 're not like them . you must have left something , or someone .
what 's going on ... .what are you doing ?	we 're leaving .
what ?	we 're leaving .
who ? who 's leaving ?	thx and me .
i can just barely see him . i think he 's leaving .	impossible !
he 's coming back for the rest of us . he ca n't make it alone .	i wonder how far he went . he 's gathered invaluable information out there .
wait ! i 'll talk to him .	ask him about the air . he looks out of breath .
that 's the most ridiculous thing i 've ever heard .	it may seem ridiculous to the untrained mind , but if you were able to interpret the calculations you would see that an apparent paradox is actually a perfect and elegant system in concept and design .
we must escape . we have plans . we can leave . we must wait until ...	incredible !
i ca n't see him at all . he 's been destroyed .	no , look ! three degrees from the central azimuth .
how far did you go ? was it cold ?	you have nothing to fear . you 're safe again .

f 2600 block of lakefront . a limousine . but , i-	thanks .
hey , that 's the guy-	we just got a bomb threat upstairs .
how 's the print coming ?	one partial from the handle matches the suspect from last night . name 's carl taylor . long record of arson , assault , the works . the other print - we got nothing from our data base or the fbi or cia ... still waiting for interpol .
coffee , mike ?	no thanks , bev .
dispatch , this is reilly .	go ahead .
patch me through to the bomb squad .	are n't you on suspension ?
just do it .	hang on .
who the heck 're you ?	you the bomb squad ?
where did you get this ?	off a girl 's wrist . a suspect ...
high-grade det cord . this girl , either she 's got strange taste in jewelry or she 's into serious demolition .	what do you mean ?
sorry about that . that 's an inch of the stuff , imagine what the whole thing 'd do .	thanks .
alright , let 's check it out .	we can start in the area where the robbery occurred .
what 're you talking about ?	when you need us , you love us , when you do n't , we 're shunned by the rest of the department .
what was- ? why ... ?	that cop who bought it ... you did n't tell us he was your partner .
what ?	this is n't bumper cars , it 's brain surgery . you wan na work with us , you do it our way , understand ?
now wait just a fucking-	be cool around my men , they do n't trust strangers . and try not to swear so much , it 's unattractive .
by the way , i 'm glass . this is t.j. , and pooch .	mike reilly .
we do n't use the b-word . bad luck .	so you 're the `` device squad '' ... and you defuse `` devices '' ?
treat . we treat devices .	anything else i should know ?
i.r.a . device . deadliest class of tickers in existence . computerized , multiple sensors , booby traps , the works . first showed up in a series of i.r.a . bombings in london couple years ago . one of their boys tripped it on himself and they went back to a less complicated timers . the girl , is she irish ?	she 's not talking . but , she could be . so , obviously , you 've seen one of these devices before ?
only once , at redstone .	where ... ?
nice performance back there . where 'd you learn that , mike ditka sensitivity seminar ?	hey , look --
no you look , mister ! first , you do n't go calling my men names . it 's bad for morale . second , us `` punks '' happen to know a heck of alot more about police work than any vice cop ever did .	oh yeah ? prove it .
the place has already be combed . forensics pulled over a hundred sets of prints inside .	then let 's go see what they missed .
so what were they doing here ?	i do n't know . you tell me ?
an abandoned machine shop ... nice place to build devices . low rent , too . but , you and rice ruined their perfect hideout .	you mentioned something called redstone .
redstone 's the army training center in alabama where they send the cream of the crop to learn about tickers .	cream of the crop , huh ? you ?
top of my class at west point , thank you very much . then off to redstone . first half of the course we learned how to build devices ... second half , we 'd take them apart . everything from firecrackers to hydrogen bombs .	sounds like terrorist heaven .
there were a few guys in my class with names like john smith , bill jones . i 'd see them up ahead in the hall , call their name , but they would n't turn around . c.i.a . funny thing , they 'd always disappear after the first half of the course .	just how easy is it to build a ... device ?
typical profile , usually losers , nobodies that 're afraid to confront their victims . they like scaring people . that 's why they call in their threats . same mentality as obscene phone callers .	except they 'll blow you up if you do n't play along .
this is where the van was parked .	yep .
then , it 's got ta be here somewhere ...	look , it 's a longshot ...
nitro-cellulose . what is that , some kind of explosive ?	industrial wood oil . separately , any one of these things could lead in several directions , but together ...
how long are we going to stay ?	`til we get a better lead .
not bad for bomb squad , eh ?	what not bad . you 've got a series of bombs , devices , that may or may not be connected , set by one or many nutjobs , who may or may not be linked .
right .	well ... it 's more than we had ten minutes ago .
you guys seem pretty tight .	we 've got ta be . in this business , you do n't exactly make alot of outside commitments .
why do you do it ?	i do n't know , it 's strange ... it 's not the best career path , but when you get the bug , there 's nothing you can do about it . see , when you beat one of these things ...
so cut both .	one shuts it down , one turns arms it .
which one 's which ?	i do n't know . there 's an old saying , when in doubt , cut the yellow wire .
how long were you hooked ?	what ?
pittsburgh , two years ago . partner died , no back-up , i was too gung-ho . as usual .	take a tip from the bomb boys , always assess , if only for a second .
i know . i was working a drug ring , deep cover . played the part too well . when they pulled me out , i was n't a cop anymore . my fiance had dumped me . next thing i knew , i was out here on the street , doped up , auditioning for the morgue when this tough old vice cop found me , cleaned me up , gave me a second chance . he promised captain winters he 'd look out for me .	your partner ?
i terrible with mechanical things .	no you 're not , you just do n't understand them . here , do what i tell you .
it 's working .	congratulations , you just built your first ticker .
ex-girlfriend ?	be right back .
what 's up ?	where you guys at ?
driving in circles , waiting for-	catch that alert ? that 's him in the u-haul .
how do you know ?	cuz he got the girl , now he 's leaving town .
should we head for the interstate ?	would you ?
no , i 'd slip out past the hotel district , behind greyhound ...	me , too .
glass , eighth street , alley behind grand hotel . cut him off .	you got it .
fuck factor ?	off the scale .
talk to me . let 's assess .	right .
c'mon , talk to me ! we can do it !	he has a timer going as back-up , in case we got a hold of the remote . okay ... first , run your fingers along the edges , feel for a sensor .
good , now the other side .	nothing .
keep talking .	close your eyes , feel your fingertips . tell me everything you feel .
wires ... metal , cold ... something soft ...	do n't touch that .
more metal ... sharp edge ...	stay to your left .
something round , two wires ...	that 's the blasting cap - good ! okay , now grab it by the base and pull it straight up . no , wait ...
what 's wrong ?	too easy . there 's got ta be something else in there , another cap maybe .
yeah , another round thing .	okay , one of the caps turns it on , the other shuts it down .
which one 's which ?	i do n't know .
what ... ?	when in doubt , pull the yellow wire .
how the hell do you feel yellow ?	no excuses , just do it !
assist ? what the hell you know about tickers anyway ?	easy , guys .
what do you think ?	call upstairs , see what you can find out .
right .	t.j. , run a trace on this , see if you can pin down where it came from . whoever these people are , let 's hope they 're all talk .
whadaya mean ?	it 's from an ira .
hey , matches are a very big thing in our line of work .	`` punks '' , huh ?
you got it .	we work fast enough for you ?
political .	exactly my thinking . except , none of the targets can actually be linked to government , political or special interest concerns . they seem to be just unrelated industrial companies . some insured , some not .
any word ?	nothing . maybe they gave up , split town .
no , we 're terrorists , stay back or we 'll blow .	we 're a bit busy at the moment , i 'll give you a statement in a few minutes if we 're still alive .
bev , you 're the greatest ...	hey , i 'm next .
yeah , he 's helping us work up a profile on this thing .	hope you do n't mind , captain , might help us catch these guys that much sooner . coming ?
we 've lost brothers too , we know what that 's like .	let 's get something straight . we 're doing you a favor . you 're not exactly a guy we want around explosives .
c4 , plastic explosive .	helluva fuck factor .
computer device ?	unlikely . probably , cash register or something .
glass , what is it ?	i was wrong ... this did n't come from any cash register .
relax , pooch , it 's just a ticker , it 's not personal .	let 's face it , we all knew it would happen sooner or later . the guy who can build a mousetrap that 's better than we are ...
lane oil ...	a bowling alley .
what do ay say ?	meg 's lasagna . good eats , reilly . c'mon .
alright !	we 've created a monster .
jesus ...	reilly ! he 's loaded !
cover . it was suppose to be abandoned buildings , y'know . no one was suppose to get hurt . the night you busted us ... we were checking to make sure there were n't any vagrants around . scare them away .	who is he ?
alex swan . my brother . the other two are called taylor and leveau .	taylor 's dead .
there is a motel downtown , near the machine shop ... the suncrest . room 138 .	thank you .
then why tell me ?	people are dying .

what is that ?	security .
what 's the matter ?	nothing ... just tired .
why are we stopping here ?	we 're moving ' on . i have to pick up the supplies . just two little boxes .
no ... no more killing .	stay here .
alex , please .	stay in the truck .
who are you calling , sis ?	what ? nobody , i-
alex , please-	shut up ! who is this ?
drop it .	take him !
i want to work this .	you 're vice , not homicide . besides , you do n't have the experience and you 're too personally involved .
looks like the stuff my dad used to use to blow up tree stumps back in scranton .	maybe she knows your old man .
what the hell was that ?	a ticking bomb ...
you touch me again and --	and what , you 'll shoot me ? hey , do n't mistake me for one of your partners , i 'd like to make retirement in one piece .
you were lucky today , vice boy . captain said to leave it alone , but just remember , i 'm watching you .	i 'm sorry , detective , but you 're just not my type .
prints ?	nothing so far .
what about the ballistics report ?	lab 's backed up , we 're still waiting for it .
it 's a bluff . the guy 's full of crap .	we ca n't take the chance . ring down to the bomb squad . i want them on alert .
what the hell 's going on ?	son-of-a-bitch ... my nose ... this fuck-up is interfering with-
i 'm filing charges against that mother-	can it , pluchinsky . and shove some cotton up your nose .
he is !	look , it 's important .
nitro , dash of semtrex , vegetable oil ...	what kind of bomb was it ?
unsolved bombings in the last year ... boston , new york , philadelphia ... but no real match	insurance ?
how 're you guys doing ?	still waiting for a miracle . go ahead .
mike . no thanks , i 'm fine .	time for bed , kiddos . say goodnight .
that guy 's wife must be pretty pissed off to play a trick like that .	no shit . i better send meg flowers just in case .

i thought you said what's-her-name 's brother was going to fix it .	she did n't work out , had to cut her loose .
what was it this time ?	she wanted to cook me breakfast .

well , have you found it ?	no ! but let me tell you -- any woman who spends a fortune in times like these for a handbag -- phooey , phooey , phooey !
m'sieu laval , madame would like to talk to mademoiselle gautier for a moment .	very well , jacques .
pardon me , m'sieu . madame colet would like to see you in the living room .	at once , jacques . we 'll continue later .
m'sieu laval , m'sieu filiba would like very much to see you .	in a moment .
on staircase ; from gaston 's point of view . he stops .	yes , m'sieu laval ?
m'sieu giron is downstairs .	tell m'sieu giron i ca n't see him now . impossible ! and , jacques . dismiss the car ! madame is not going .
still studying the vase . mariette appears . he turns to her .	where did you find it ?
is this what you mean , m'sieu laval ?	erect in sweater , arms folded .
no !	in doorway . he bows , returns into office ; door shuts .
eleven o'clock !	a man in love , completely shaken . he sits on bed , thinks , then takes telephone slowly , decisively .
with the compliments of colet and company !	he bows , goes . door shuts behind him .
the representative of the police wants to know how much money you had , m'sieu filiba .	i had exactly twenty thousand lire . i had just cashed a traveler 's check and put it in my wallet .
why did you let this man in , m'sieu filiba ?	well , he knocked at the door . you see , i was expecting two -- uh -- two business associates .
and then what happened , m'sieu filiba ?	i said , `` come in . '' and there he was . a fine-looking man with a moustache and long sideburns . he said , `` good evening . i 'm the doctor . '' i said , `` doctor ? '' he said , `` yes , the doctor . i came to see about your tonsils . ''
the representative of the police wants to know if there is anything wrong with your tonsils .	no !
< u > niente ! < /u >	that 's just what i tried to tell him . well , one word led to another . he really was a very charming fellow . so we talked for about ten minutes .
what did you talk about ?	about tonsils .
< u > tonsili ! < /u >	so i said to myself , `` all right , if he wants to look at them , let him look at them . no harm in that . '' and then he said , `` say ah . '' and then i said , `` ah . '' and that 's all i remember ... and when i woke up , i still had my tonsils , but my pocketbook was gone .
pardon me , m'sieu , but i have the feeling we have met somewhere before .	i 'm sorry , but i do n't seem to recall the occasion . no , i 'm afraid ...
yes , m'sieu filiba ?	you see -- no , no ! and < u > yet < /u > -- < u > did < /u > i -- did -- now < u > where < /u > could we have --
i wanted to say goodbye to you .	goodbye , m'sieu filiba .
but before i say goodbye i want to ask you one question : have you ever been in venice ?	no .
you 've < u > never < /u > been in venice ?	no ... have < u > you < /u > ever been in vienna ?
no .	amsterdam ?
no .	constantinople ?
no .	you 've never been in constantinople ?
no !	but you < u > have < /u > been in venice ?
yes !	let me tell you , venice < u > ca n't < /u > < u > compare < /u > with constantinople .
but --	i do n't care < u > what < /u > you say ! in constantinople at least you have streets , sultans , pashas --
and harems ... ?	< u > all < /u > < u > kinds < /u > .
good morning , major .	good morning . i'd-i'd-i 'd like to look at some cuff links .
nice day , major .	umm .
you 're looking fine , major .	now see here , my good man . i 've had just about enough of your insulting remarks !
no doubt about it -- it 's that secretary .	funny , the kind of men women fall for .
no color , no sparkle -- but dependable .	the type they marry .
you know , i 'm not the marrying type . i like to take my fun and leave it .	nice suit .
like it ?	smart . london , eh ?
ogilvie and oglethorpe .	i thought so .
he 's really not a bad fellow .	just dull .
insignificant ... he 's a secretary , always < u > was < /u > a secretary , always < u > will < /u > be .	funny -- the first time i saw him i thought he was a doctor !
yes , sir ? what shall we start with , baron ?	oh , yes ... well , that 's not so easy . beginnings are always difficult .
yes , baron .	if casanova suddenly ... turned out to be romeo ... having supper with juliet -- who might become cleopatra ... how would you start ?
i would start with cocktails .	um-hum . very good . excellent !
it must be the most marvelous supper . we may not eat it , but it must be marvelous .	yes , baron .
and , waiter -- you see that moon ?	yes , baron .
i want to see that moon in the champagne .	yes , baron . moon in champagne .
i want to see --	yes , baron .
and as for you , waiter --	yes , baron ?
i do n't want to see you at all !	no , baron ! i beg your pardon .
you 're not safe anywhere nowadays .	but please , baron . we 're not supposed to breathe a word of it . you wo n't tell anybody i told you ?
you can trust me .	yes , baron . thank you .
m'sieu laval , there are several things i 've wanted to ask you for quite a while . i understand you are from marseilles .	um-hum ...
you must be related to the lavals of marseilles .	just a second .
i hope you find the figures correct .	i hope so , too .
m'sieu laval , i have enjoyed the confidence of this family --	for more than forty years . so madame told me .
and you , m'sieu giron , seem to be disturbing my examination of < u > this < /u > < u > report < /u > .	examination ! m'sieu laval , what are you insinuating ? i have enjoyed the confidence of this family for more than forty years . how long have you enjoyed madame 's confidence ? three weeks , i believe .
two weeks and three days .	um-hum !
are < u > you < /u > insinuating anything , m'sieu giron ?	no , not at all !
well , that 's fine . then you are not insinuating that i am avoiding questions . and i am not insinuating that you wo n't let me examine this report .	i was only asking if you are related to the lavals of marseilles .
and i was only asking you if you would let me examine your report without interruption .	i do n't see why any man should get excited when he is asked about his hometown .
and i do n't see any reason for any man getting nervous when somebody checks over the figures of his report .	are you insinuating that this is not an honest report ?
i am only insinuating that you are nervous .	nervous ! why should i be nervous ?
i 'm very sorry , but this is no time , m'sieu giron --	i 've got to see you .
but not now .	right now ! it 's very important , m'sieu laval .
it may be important to you , m'sieu giron --	no , to you -- m'sieu < u > monescu < /u > .
yes , m'sieu .	and you will be out by tomorrow morning .
very well , m'sieu .	otherwise i 'll call the police
yes , m'sieu . m'sieu giron !	what is it ?
you have enjoyed the confidence of this family for more than forty years . you must be a man of about -- about sixty-five . let 's see -- you will be exactly eighty-seven when you come out of prison .	what do you mean ?
you say i am a crook .	i know it !
then why did n't you call the police ? why < u > do n't < /u > you call the police ? i 'll tell you why -- you crook , you .	m'sieu ...
monescu .	m'sieu monescu !
you see , the bag has just been found , and the reaction of relief from her former excitement and strain is just a little too much for her . it 's not very serious , but just the same we 'd better not take any chances .	just as you say , doctor .
thank you , major .	good day , doctor .
no , no , no ! i disagree with you absolutely . that 's the trouble with you artillery men .	now just a minute , major --
who ?	the marquis de la tours . he was in the lobby . but i do n't think he saw me . i 'm positive he did n't . thank heaven ! ... but when i came up here , right out in the hall there was king boris of alconia !
the tennis player ?	the tennis player . he saw me . he bowed . what could i do ? i nodded . baron , i should n't have come !
do you < u > know < /u > king boris ?	no -- no .
do you know the marquis de la tours ?	i would like to .
you 'd better not . he 's really very dull . but anyhow , when the king tells the marquis he saw me , the marquis will tell the marchesa . and the marchesa is the best friend of the duchess of chambro . and < u > she < /u > will phone the princess de costa . the princess does n't like me -- but i do n't care !	why should you ?
do n't stop . keep right on complaining . it 's beautiful .	you know , when i first saw you , i thought you were an american .
thank you !	someone from another world -- so entirely different . one gets so tired of one 's own class -- princes and counts and dukes and kings -- ah ! and everybody talking shop -- always trying to sell jewelry ... and then i heard your name and found you were just one of us .
disappointed ?	no -- proud . very proud !
that 's hotel life . in one room a man loses his wallet and in another room a man loses -- his head .	please . when i came here it was for a little adventure -- a little game which you play tonight and forget tomorrow . but something has changed me -- and it is n't the champagne . the whole thing is new to me . very new . i 've got a confession to make to you . baron , you are a crook . you robbed the gentleman in two fifty-three , five , seven , and nine . may i have the salt ?
please .	thank you .
the pepper , too ?	no , thank you .
i like you , baron .	i 'm crazy about you . by the way , your pin .
thank you , baron .	not at all , countess ... there 's one very good stone in it .

they 're all right , are n't they ?	beautiful . and what of it ? let me tell you something : so far as i 'm concerned , her whole sex appeal is in that safe !
gaston . let 's open it -- right now ! let 's get away from here ! i do n't like this place !	oh , no , darling . there 's < u > more < /u > sex appeal coming on the first of the month . it 's only ten days ... eight hundred and fifty thousand francs .

you < u > have < /u > to get out of here !	that 's what i 'm here for -- to get out ! i want to get away from here , from you -- as fast as i can and as far as a hundred thousand francs will take me . sixty-five , ninety-four --
do n't you < u > realize < /u > --	thirty-five to the left -- sixty- three , eight ... i would n't fall for another man if he were the biggest crook on earth ... seventy-six , eighty-four , fifty-five -- what has she got that i have n't got ?
lily , you must listen to me .	shut up ! do n't make up any stories !
but , lily --	do n't you dare lie to me ! i know you love me . well , why do n't you say something ? come on -- be brilliant . talk yourself out of it -- bluff yourself in ! shut up , you liar , you ! that 's what i want ! this is real ! money ! cash !
and you --	lily --
goodbye -- madame colet and company !	lily !
yes ... ?	will you be good enough to look at this bag , madame ?
you know the main staircase in the opera ?	yes .
then you go to the left . there 's a landing .	yes .
then you go into the foyer .	yes .
and as you leave the foyer , there is a little niche .	i know that niche .
and in that niche , there is a statue of venus .	i remember .
you like that statue ?	not particularly .
neither do i. that 's where i found it .	i do n't know how i could have lost it there . i was nowhere near that niche .
oh ... that 's strange . maybe -- are you sure this is your bag ?	of course it is ! are you doubting me ?
not in the least , madame . but you see , it 's a very expensive bag -- one has to be careful .	well -- i am madame colet .
well -- how do you do , m'sieu laval ?	the pleasure is mine , madame .
one purse -- empty . one vanity case --	but really , m'sieu , this is n't necessary .
please , madame colet , i believe in doing things correctly . shall we continue ? two hairpins , one cigarette lighter , one box of real matches , and -- oh , yes , this letter from major --	oh ! you did n't read it !
naturally i did .	oh !
you need n't be embarrassed , madame . a lady as charming as you would , and < u > should < /u > , get love letters .	m'sieu laval !
but one suggestion , madame . not the major . i do n't mind his grammatical mistakes . i 'll overlook his bad punctuation . but the letter has no mystery -- no bouquet -- no ... and one lipstick ... scarlet number four .	what 's wrong now ?
with your skin , i prefer crimson .	too much blue in crimson .
that 's what you need !	no , no , no ! i disagree with you completely ! i tried it once --
what shade of powder do you use ?	peaches and cream .
that 's too dark .	do you realize i have light eyes ?
goodbye , m'sieu la -- oh , yes ... this is a rather delicate matter and i do n't want to ... you see , if you read my advertisement carefully , you must have noticed that there was ...	in other words , madame , it embarrasses you to offer me the twenty thousand francs reward .
yes .	do n't be embarrassed , madame . i 'll take it . i need the money . i wish i were in a position to ignore the whole matter . but you know , madame , the stock market , bank crash ... to make a long story short -- a member of the nouveaux poor .
do you know my first name ?	no . what is it ? tell me .
and do you know what i 'd like to have you do with that check ?	what ?
make it out to cash !	as you like .
eighteenth century .	yes !
early eighteenth century . i should say around -- seventeen thirty .	right !
beautiful specimen .	it < u > is < /u > beautiful . but i got a little tired of sleeping in antiques , so i gave it to my secretary .
oh ?	this used to be my secretary 's room .
i see . she must have been very happy here .	too happy . that 's why i discharged her .
but , madame , you keep a hundred thousand francs -- in your safe -- at < u > home < /u > ?	you think that 's too much ?
no ! not enough ! in times like these , when everything is uncertain , every conservative person should have a substantial part of his fortune within arm 's reach .	that sounds sensible .
madame colet , i think you deserve a scolding . first , you lose your bag --	then i mislay my checkbook --
then you use the wrong lipstick --	and how i handle my < u > money < /u > !
it 's disgraceful !	tell me , m'sieu laval , what else is wrong ?
everything ! ... madame colet , if i were your father -- which , fortunately , i am not --	ye-es ?
and you made any attempt to handle your own business affairs , i would give you a good spanking -- in a business way , of course .	what would you do if you were my < u > secretary < /u > ?
the same thing .	you 're hired !
madame .	will you be good enough to run through these papers with m'sieu giron ?
i 'll be delighted .	and so will m'sieu giron .
yes , madame ?	what are you going to do with my day tomorrow , m'sieu laval ?
well , we 'll have breakfast in the garden .	um-hum ...
then riding together .	um-hum ...
then lunch in the bois --	together .
then a little nap --	how do you like my dress ?
beautiful .	hair ?
marvelous .	lipstick ?
crimson !	correct ! good night .
good night .	good night .
but you have an engagement , and i do n't want people to talk .	talk ? about me -- about us ?
precisely .	afraid i 'm ruining your reputation , m'sieu laval ?
no -- yours , madame .	m'sieu laval , i 've got a confession to make to you ...
but incidentally , let me tell you , < u > i < /u > do n't like < u > you < /u > . i do n't like you at all ! i would n't hesitate one instant to ruin < u > your < /u > reputation -- like that !	you would ?
yes , i would !	like that ?
like that !	i know all your tricks .
and you 're going to fall for them .	so you think you can get me ?
any minute i want !	you 're conceited --
but attractive --	< u > now < /u > , < u > let < /u > < u > me < /u > < u > tell < /u > < u > you < /u > --
i want you to stay , mariette . you 've < u > got < /u > to stay . you ca n't go now !	i < u > must < /u > go .
i 'm crazy about you !	i know it .
< u > i < /u > < u > love < /u > < u > you < /u > .	i < u > believe < /u > you .
then why do you want to go ?	because i want to make it tough for you .
when a lady takes her jewels off in a gentleman 's room , where does she put them ?	on the night table .
ah , let me have a little fun .	please !
thirty-three --	no -- thirty-five !
yes , gaston ?	what would you say if you found your safe had been robbed ?
i would n't say anything -- i would act .	call the police ?
instantly .	um- < u > hum < /u > ...
you look beautiful .	thank you . seventy-six , eighty --
mariette !	yes , gaston ?
you have been robbed -- for years . and not a hundred thousand francs , but millions . and you know who did it ? adolph .	< u > adolph < /u > ?
adolph j. giron .	and you expect me to believe that ?
why not ? he 's a thief -- he 's a criminal .	i do n't believe it !
it would be a terrible scandal , would n't it ?	giron ... !
goodbye ...	goodbye .
it could have been marvelous ...	divine ...
wonderful ... but tomorrow morning , if you should wake out of your dreams and hear a knock , and the door opens , and there , instead of a maid with a breakfast tray , stands a policeman with a warrant -- then you 'll be glad you 're alone .	but it could have been glorious .
lovely .	divine ... but that terrible policeman !
oh , m'sieu laval ...	yes , madame colet ?
has mademoiselle gautier gone ?	yes -- uh --
oh , that 's too bad . you see , i wanted her to do something . well , i guess i 'll have to do it myself .	what is it , madame ?
oh , no , it 's the way you lead .	no , madame , it 's the way you < u > follow < /u > .
no , m'sieu !	yes , madame !
but my dear m'sieu giron , i 'm having a tea party . must i be bothered with all these papers now ?	i 'm sorry , madame , but there are still certain matters which i think you should attend to yourself . and i , personally , would not care to refer them to -- to --
madame colet , i 've enjoyed the confidence of your family for more than forty years . i was a school friend of your husband 's ...	i know !
madame , let me ask you : who is m'sieu laval , anyhow ? where does he come from ? what is he ?	he is my secretary ! i hope that answers all your questions , m'sieu giron .
you know what paris is saying about the countess falconier and her chauffeur ?	jacques !
you 've had your breakfast -- oh , but of course you have .	yes , madame . you see , i have to get up very early . my little brother goes to school -- you see , mother is dead .
two lumps , madame ?	please ! thank you .
yes , madame ?	you see -- oh , not a word to m'sieu laval !
about what ?	potatoes . he does n't want me to eat them -- and naturally i do n't want to upset him .
now . uh -- mademoiselle -- in the short time you have been m'sieu laval 's secretary , have you noticed any change in him ?	well -- uh -- yes and no .
to me he seems rather nervous .	nervous ? um-hum . he smokes too much !
no , he < u > works < /u > too much . he 's chained to his desk . too much detail . now , if you could take over some of his work --	so he would n't be confined so much to his office --
yes ! and he would have a little more time for --	for all the really important things --
right !	i 'll do my best , madame , even if i have to work every night .
oh , no , no , no , no , my dear child ! that 's ridiculous . you go home as usual -- five o'clock every day . now i 'm going to be a little bit of a tyrant -- i insist . it 'll be nice for your little brother , too . < u > five < /u > < u > o'clock < /u > -- remember !	very well , madame . thank you .
yes , madame ?	how much is your salary ?
well , in times like these most people are cutting salaries , but suppose we say , in your case , three hundred and fifty ?	oh , madame , you 're just too sweet for words !
i think you 'd better go .	ever had a romance with a crook ?
i beg your pardon !	let me give you a little advice . when you embrace him , be sure to put on your gloves . it would be too bad if your fingerprints were found ...
mademoiselle gautier -- or whatever your name is -- i thank you for your advice , but i must ask you to go . you 've got your money --	i do n't want your money !
you should be ashamed of yourselves . two men of your standing , always quarreling .	he started it .
but you 're the more intelligent one .	that 's true .
then why did you do it ?	because i hate him -- because i love you !
you should have more self-control . you were in the army .	well , he was in the navy .
your bag ?	yes , my bag !
did n't you take it with you ?	apparently not . do n't you know where it is ?
no -- i 'm sorry .	but you saw it here .
yes , i saw it -- but --	well , where is it ?
water 14 feet above the keel in ten minutes ... in the forepeak ... in all three holds ... and in boiler room six .	that 's right .
five compartments . she can stay afloat with the first four compartments breached . but not five . not five . as she goes down by the head the water will spill over the tops of the bulkheads ... at e deck ... from one to the next ... back and back . there 's no stopping it .	the pumps --
how much time ?	an hour , two at most .
your ship is a wonder , mr. andrews . truly .	thank you , rose .
mr. andrews , i did the sum in my head , and with the number of lifeboats times the capacity you mentioned ... forgive me , but it seems that there are not enough for everyone aboard .	about half , actually . rose , you miss nothing , do you ? in fact , i put in these new type davits , which can take an extra row of boats here . but it was thought ... by some ... that the deck would look too cluttered . so i was over-ruled .
i saw the iceberg , mr. andrews . and i see it in your eyes . please tell me the truth .	the ship will sink .
you 're certain ?	yes . in an hour or so ... all this ... will be at the bottom of the atlantic .
please tell only who you must , i do n't want to be responsible for a panic . and get to a boat quickly . do n't wait . you remember what i told you about the boats ?	yes , i understand . thank you .
mr. andrews , thank god ! where would the master at arms take someone under arrest ? !	what ? you have to get to a boat right away !
no ! i 'll do this with or without your help , sir . but without will take longer .	take the elevator to the very bottom , go left , down the crewman 's passage , then make a right .
bottom , left , right . i have it .	hurry , rose .
wo n't you even make a try for it , mr. andrews ?	i 'm sorry that i did n't build you a stronger ship , young rose .
good luck to you , rose .	and to you , mr. andrews .
i 'm in the sitting room . heading for bedroom b-54 .	stay off the floor . do n't stir it up like you did yesterday .
who 's the best ? say it .	you are , lewis . you rolling ?
shit .	you know , boss , this happened to geraldo and his career never recovered .
she says she 's rose dewitt bukater , right ? rose dewitt bukater died on the titanic . at the age of 17. if she'd 've lived , she 'd be over a hundred now .	a hundred and one next month .
we 've put together the world 's largest database on the titanic . okay , here ...	rose might not want to see this , lewis .
so let me get this right . you were gon na kill yourself by jumping off the titanic ? that 's great !	lewis ...
holy shit .	do n't drop it rose .
rush her .	it 's hers , you schmuck . look , rose , i ... i do n't know what to say to a woman who tries to jump off the titanic when it 's not sinking , and jumps back onto it when it is ... we 're not dealing with logic here , i know that ... but please ... think about this a second .
hey , lizzy . i need to talk to you for a second .	do n't you mean work me ?
look , i 'm running out of time . i need your help .	i 'm not going to help you browbeat my hundred and one year old grandmother . i came down here to tell you to back off .
what ?	that 's the shape my hand 's gon na be when i hold that thing . you understand ? i 'm not leaving here without it .
the partners want to know how it 's going ?	how it 's going ? it 's going like a first date in prison , whattaya think ? !
there 's a satellite call for you .	bobby , we 're launching . see these submersibles here , going in the water ? take a message .
this is brock lovett . what can i do for you , mrs ... ?	rose calvert .
i told you you wanted to take this call .	alright . you have my attention , rose . can you tell me who the woman in the picture is ?
none of the stewards have seen her .	this is ridiculous , lovejoy . find her .
she 's not on the starboard side either .	we 're running out of time . and this strutting martinet ... ... is n't letting any men in at all .
the one on the other side is letting men in .	then that 's our play . but we 're still going to need some insurance . come on .
i make my own luck .	so do i .
we 're too late .	there are still some boats forward . stay with this one ... murdoch . he seems to be quite ... practical .
what could possible be funny ?	i put the diamond in my coat pocket . and i put my coat ... on her .
your daughter is much too hard to impress , ruth . mind your step .	so this is the ship they say is unsinkable .
steerage swine . apparently missed his annual bath .	honestly , cal , if you were n't forever booking everything at the last instant , we could have gone through the terminal instead of running along the dock like some squalid immigrant family .
you know i do n't like that , rose .	she knows .
it 's just the god damned english doing everything by the book .	there 's no need for language , mr. hockley . go back and turn the heater on in my room , so it wo n't be too cold when we get back .
you told me to change .	i could n't let you wear black on sailing day , sweetpea . it 's bad luck .
those mud puddles were certainly a waste of money .	you 're wrong . they 're fascinating . like in a dream ... there 's truth without logic . what 's his name again ... ? picasso .
what made you think you could put your hands on my fiancee ? ! look at me , you filth ! what did you think you were doing ? !	cal , stop ! it was an accident .
an accident ? !	it was ... stupid really . i was leaning over and i slipped .
i was leaning way over , to see the ... ah ... propellers . and i slipped and i would have gone overboard ... and mr. dawson here saved me and he almost went over himself .	you wanted to see the propellers ?
is that the going rate for saving the woman you love ?	rose is displeased . mmm ... what to do ?
my god ... cal . is it a --	diamond . yes it is . 56 carats .
it was once worn by louis the sixteenth . they call it le coeur de la mer , the --	the heart of the ocean . cal , it 's ... it 's overwhelming .
i had hoped you would come to me last night .	i was tired .
yes . your exertions below decks were no doubt exausting .	i see you had that undertaker of a manservant follow me .
you will never behave like that again ! do you understand ?	i 'm not some foreman in your mills than you can command ! i am your fiancee --
something serious has happened .	that 's right . two things dear to me have disappeared this evening . now that one is back ... ... i have a pretty good idea where to find the other . search him .
but i was with him the whole time .	maybe he did it while you were putting your clothes back on .
oh , mother shut up ! do n't you understand ? the water is freezing and there are n't enough boats ... not enough by half . half the people on this ship are going to die .	not the better half .
where are you going ? to him ? is that it ? to be a whore to that gutter rat ?	i 'd rather be his whore than your wife .
yes , i lived . how awkward for you .	rose ... your mother and i have been looking for you --
is this in any way unclear ?	what do i tell your mother ?
you 're precious to me , rose .	jewels are precious . goodbye , mr. hockley .
i know . perhaps you could join us for dinner tomorrow , to regale our group with your heroic tale ?	sure . count me in .
this should be amusing .	can i bum a cigarette ?
just a soupcon of lemon ... ... it improves the flavor with champagne .	no caviar for me , thanks . never did like it much .
no thanks . i 'm heading back .	probably best . it 'll be all business and politics , that sort of thing . would n't interest you . good of you to come .
there are boats on the other side that are allowing men in . jack and i can get off safely . both of us .	i 'll be alright . hurry up so we can get going ... we got our own boat to catch .
you 're a good liar .	almost as good as you .
let 's see ... fabrizio 's got niente . olaf , you 've got squat . sven , uh oh ... two pair ... mmm . sorry fabrizio .	what sorry ? what you got ? you lose my money ? ? ma va fa'n culo testa di cazzo --
'cause you 're goin ' to america ! ! full house boys !	porca madonna ! ! yeeaaaaa ! ! !
goin ' home ... to the land o ' the free and the home of the real hot- dogs ! on the titanic ! ! we 're ridin ' in high style now ! we 're practically goddamned royalty , ragazzo mio ! !	you see ? is my destinio ! ! like i told you . i go to l'america ! ! to be a millionaire ! ! capito ? ? i go to america ! !
you know somebody ?	of course not . that 's not the point . goodbye ! goodbye ! ! i 'll miss you !
how you two doin ' ?	i do n't know what she 's say , she do n't know what i say , so we get along fine .
the boats are all going .	we got ta get up there or we 're gon na be gargling saltwater . where 's tommy ?
you can smell ice , you know , when it 's near .	bollocks .
cor ... look at that , would ya .	they 're a bloody sight warmer than we are .
oy , mate ... that was a close shave .	smell ice , can you ? bleedin ' christ !
keep pulling ... away from the ship . pull .	ai n't you boys ever rowed before ? here , gim me those oars . i 'll show ya how it 's done .
the suction will pull us right down if we do n't keep going .	we got room for lots more . i say we go back .
they 'll pull us right down i tell ya !	aw knock it off , yer scarin ' me . come on girls , grab your oars . let 's go . well come on !
i do n't understand a one of you . what 's the matter with you ? it 's your men back there ! we got plenty a ' room for more .	if you do n't shut that hole in yer face , there 'll be one less in this boat !
so you 've not lit the last four boilers then ?	no , but we 're making excellent time .
captain , the press knows the size of titanic , let them marvel at her speed too . we must give them something new to print . and the maiden voyage of titanic must make headlines !	i prefer not to push the engines until they 've been properly run in .
why have we stopped ?	we 've struck ice .
well , do you think the ship is seriously damaged ?	excuse me .
take my hand . i 'll pull you back in .	no ! stay where you are . i mean it . i 'll let go .
no you wo n't .	what do you mean no i wo n't ? do n't presume to tell me what i will and will not do . you do n't know me .
you 're distracting me . go away .	i ca n't . i 'm involved now . if you let go i have to jump in after you .
the fall alone would kill you .	it would hurt . i 'm not saying it would n't . to be honest i 'm a lot more concerned about the water being so cold .
how cold ?	freezing . maybe a couple degrees over .
ever been to wisconsin ?	no .
well they have some of the coldest winters around , and i grew up there , near chippewa falls . once when i was a kid me and my father were ice- fishing out on lake wissota ... ice- fishing 's where you chop a hole in the --	i know what ice fishing is !
sorry . just ... you look like kind of an indoor girl . anyway , i went through some thin ice and i 'm tellin ' ya , water that cold ... like that right down there ... it hits you like a thousand knives all over your body . you ca n't breath , you ca n't think ... least not about anything but the pain . which is why i 'm not looking forward to jumping in after you . but like i said , i do n't see a choice . i guess i 'm kinda hoping you 'll come back over the rail and get me off the hook here .	you 're crazy .
i 'm jack dawson .	pleased to meet you , mr. dawson .
help ! help ! !	i 've got you . i wo n't let go .
hello again .	could i speak to you in private ?
so , you got a name by the way ?	rose . rose dewitt bukater .
mr. dawson , i --	jack .
jack ... i feel like such an idiot . it took me all morning to get up the nerve to face you .	well , here you are .
here i am . i ... i want to thank you for what you did . not just for ... for pulling me back . but for your discretion .	you 're welcome . rose .
look , i know what you must be thinking ! poor little rich girl . what does she know about misery ?	that 's not what i was thinking . what i was thinking was ... what could have happened to hurt this girl so much she though she had no way out .
i do n't ... it was n't just one thing . it was everything . it was them , it was their whole world . and i was trapped in it , like an insect in amber . i just had to get away ... just run and run and run ... and then i was at the back rail and there was no more ship ... even the titanic was n't big enough . not enough to get away from them . and before i 'd really though about it , i was over the rail . i was so furious . i 'll show them . they 'll be sorry !	uh huh . they 'll be sorry . 'course you 'll be dead .
oh god , i am such an utter fool .	that penguin last night , is he one of them ?
penguin ? oh , cal ! he is them .	is he your boyfriend ?
so you feel like you 're stuck on a train you ca n't get off 'cause you 're marryin ' this fella .	yes , exactly !
so do n't marry him .	if only it were that simple .
it is that simple .	oh , jack ... please do n't judge me until you 've seen my world .
what 's this ?	just some sketches .
jack , these are quite good ! really , they are .	well , they did n't think too much of 'em in paree .
oh no ! oh , i 'm so sorry . truly !	well , they did n't think too much of 'em in paree .
and these were drawn from life ?	yup . that 's one of the great things about paris . lots of girls willing take their clothes off .
you liked this woman . you used her several times .	she had beautiful hands .
i think you must have had a love affair with her ...	no , no ! just with her hands .
you have a gift , jack . you do . you see people .	i see you .
and ... ?	you wouldn'ta jumped .
you know , my dream has always been to just chuck it all and become an artist ... living in a garret , poor but free !	you would n't last two days . there 's no hot water , and hardly ever any caviar .
listen , buster ... i hate caviar ! and i 'm tired of people dismissing my dreams with a chuckle and a pat on the head .	i 'm sorry . really ... i am .
so then what , mr. wandering jack ?	well , then logging got to be too much like work , so i went down to los angeles to the pier in santa monica . that 's a swell place , they even have a rollercoaster . i sketched portraits there for ten cents a piece .
a whole ten cents ? !	yeah ; it was great money ... i could make a dollar a day , sometimes . but only in summer . when it got cold , i decided to go to paris and see what the real artists were doing .
why ca n't i be like you jack ? just head out for the horizon whenever i feel like it . say we 'll go there , sometime ... to that pier ... even if we only ever just talk about it .	alright , we 're going . we 'll drink cheap beer and go on the rollercoaster until we throw up and we 'll ride horses on the beach ... right in the surf ... but you have to ride like a cowboy , none of that side-saddle stuff .
you mean one leg on each side ? scandalous ! can you show me ?	sure . if you like .
i think i would . and teach me to spit too . like a man . why should only men be able to spit . it 's unfair .	they did n't teach you that in finishing school ? here , it 's easy . watch closely .
i saw that in a nickelodeon once , and i always wanted to do it .	cal , surely you remember mr. dawson .
jack , must you go ?	time for my coach to turn back into a pumpkin .
may i cut in , miss ?	you 're still my best girl , cora .
i do n't know the steps .	just move with me . do n't think .
you 're not one of them . there 's been a mistake .	a mistake ?
uh huh . you got mailed to the wrong address .	i did , did n't i ? look ! a shooting star .
that was a long one . my father used to say that whenever you saw one , it was a soul going to heaven .	i like that . are n't we supposed to wish on it ?
rose , you 're no picnic ... you 're a spoiled little brat even , but under that you 're a strong , pure heart , and you 're the most amazingly astounding girl i 've ever known and --	jack , i --
you 're making this very hard . i 'll be fine . really .	i do n't think so . they 've got you in a glass jar like some butterfly , and you 're goin ' to die if you do n't break out . maybe not right away , 'cause you 're strong . but sooner or later the fire in you is goin ' to go out .
it 's not up to you to save me , jack .	you 're right . only you can do that .
fabrizio said you might be up --	sssshh . come here .
will this light do ? do n't artists need good light ?	zat is true , i am not used to working in such 'orreeble conditions . hey ... monet !
cal insist on lugging this thing everywhere .	should i be expecting him anytime soon ?
what is it ? a sapphire ?	a diamond . a very rare diamond , called the heart of the ocean .
i believe you are blushing , mr. big artiste . i ca n't imagine monsieur monet blushing .	he does landscapes .
pretty tough for a valet , this fella .	he 's an ex-pinkerton . cal 's father hired him to keep cal out of trouble ... to make sure he always got back to the hotel with his wallet and watch , after some crawl through the less reputable parts of town ...
where to , miss ?	to the stars .
are you nervous ?	au contraire , mon cher .
you 're trembling .	it 's okay . i 'm alright .
when this ship docks , i 'm getting off with you .	this is crazy .
looks okay . i do n't see anything .	could it have damaged the ship ?
it 's bad .	we have to tell mother and cal .
now it 's worse .	come with me , jack . i jump , you jump ... right ?
this is horseshit .	cal , you ca n't be serious ! we 're in the middle of an emergency and you --
do n't you believe it , rose . do n't !	he could n't have .
that guy lovejoy put it in my pocket .	i know , i know .
so ... how did you find out i did n't do it ?	i did n't . i just realized i already knew .
you have to go for help .	i 'll be right back .
will this work ?	we 'll find out .
i 'm not going without you .	get in the boat , rose .
you jump , i jump , right ?	right .
look for something floating . some debris ... wood ... anything .	it 's so cold .
it 's getting quiet .	just a few more minutes . it 'll take them a while to get the boats organized ...
no ... do n't say your good-byes , rose . do n't you give up . do n't do it .	i 'm so cold .
you 're going to get out of this ... you 're going to go on and you 're going to make babies and watch them grow and you 're going to die an old lady , warm in your bed . not here . not this night . do you understand me ?	i ca n't feel my body .
you must do me this honor ... promise me you will survive ... that you will never give up ... no matter what happens ... no matter how hopeless ... promise me now , and never let go of that promise .	i promise .
never let go .	i promise . i will never let go , jack . i 'll never let go .
i do n't think i 've ever seen such a flat calm , in 24 years at sea .	yes , like a mill pond . not a breath of wind .
it 's make the bergs harder to see , with no breaking water at the base .	mmmmm . well , i 'm off . maintain speed and heading , mr. lightoller .
yes sir .	and wake me , of course , if anything becomes in the slightest degree doubtful .
april 14 , 1912 .	if your grandma is who she says she is , she was wearing the diamond the day titanic sank . and that makes you my new best friend . i will happily compensate you for anything you can tell us that will lead to its recovery .
wait ! can you give us something go on , here . like who had access to the safe . what about this lovejoy guy ? the valet . did he have the combination ?	that 's enough .
maybe she wants to make peace with the past .	what past ? she has never once , not once , ever said a word about being on the titanic until two days ago .
then we 're all meeting your grandmother for the first time .	you think she was really there ?
i 'm sorry .	we were pissin ' in the wind the whole time .
is your stateroom alright ?	yes . very nice . have you met my granddaughter , lizzy ? she takes care of me .
there , that 's nice . i have to have my pictures when i travel . and freddy of course . is n't that right , sweetie .	would you like anything ?
louis the sixteenth wore a fabulous stone , called the blue diamond of the crown , which disappeared in 1792 , about the time louis lost everything from the neck up . the theory goes that the crown diamond was chopped too ... recut into a heart-like shape ... and it became le coeur de la mer . the heart of the ocean . today it would be worth more than the hope diamond .	it was a dreadful , heavy thing . i only wore it this once .
i tracked it down through insurance records ... and old claim that was settled under terms of absolute secrecy . do you know who the claiment was , rose ?	someone named hockley , i should imagine .
it 's been 84 years ...	just tell us what you can --
i can still feel its weight . if you could have felt it , not just seen it ...	well , that 's the general idea , my dear .
rose , tell us more about the diamond . what did hockley do with it after that ?	i 'm afraid i 'm feeling a little tired , mr. lovett .
do n't come any closer .	you had it the entire time ? !
my god , rose , what 's gotten into --	excuse me .
mother , may i introduce jack dawson .	charmed , i 'm sure .
rose , this is not a game ! our situation is precarious . you know the money 's gone !	of course i know it 's gone . you remind me every day !
i do n't understand you . it is a fine match with hockley , and it will insure our survival .	how can you put this on my shoulders ?
do you want to se me working as a seamstress ? is that what you want ? do you want to see our fine things sold at an auction , our memories scattered to the winds ? my god , rose , how can you be so selfish ?	it 's so unfair .
rose , get in the boat !	goodbye , mother .
anya !	do n't you hate people that surprise you ? ... i do . we ca n't stand here .
anya , i think you 're crazy .	any woman 's crazy to feel about a man the way i do about you .
then why the sudden exit without even telling me ?	do you want the truth , anya ?
it would be a nice change from you .	i had an idea your husband was getting suspicious .
you 're a charming liar . you < u > know < /u > , herbert 's too dull to be suspicious about anything -- even when i suddenly decided to come to europe at a few hours ' notice --	how 'd you ever get away with it ?
when i found out you were going i just had an attack of nerves -- a few tears -- and herbert was on his way downtown to get my passport ... so who cares ... i 'm here with you ... and that 's all that matters to me .	sure !
here 's to europe ! could n't try to look a little less glum , could you ?	do n't be crazy -- i 'm tickled to death to see you .
but , anya , dear ! unless you play we wo n't have a fourth .	i 'm sorry , but you three men can play poker or something . shall i see you tomorrow ?
hope we 're not intruding .	this is miss marsh .
well -- shall we go into dinner ?	i 'll join you later .
so that 's your little dancer that you were playing around with in new york . oh -- there 's no accounting for tastes -- mine , too , seem to be in the gutter .	i can explain --
do n't look so uncomfortable , lee -- it interferes with your good looks . give me a cigarette . what did you do -- persuade her to come on this voyage with you ?	do n't talk such bunk ! she 's one of the acts on the ship . i just ran into her by accident .
did you muss up her hair by accident , too ?	you mind your own business ! she 's an old friend of mine and i like her -- what 're you going to do about it ?
just make it as difficult as possible for you to see her .	i did n't ask you to come away with me --
oh -- a hundred times --	-- and i can tell you where to get off .
and when you do i 'll convey your respects by wireless to herbert . take it easy , lee -- no other woman 'll ever get you . at least i 'm honest when i tell you there must be something pretty low down in me -- because i like you . you 're such a swine !	will you leave me alone ?
i like touching you -- poison ivy . you 'd just been kissing that girl when i came in , had n't you ?	baloney !
i can think of nothing nicer . it 's very kind of you to invite me --	i 'm just commencing to enjoy this trip .
feeling a little better , i see .	yes , yes -- the air -- -- i 'm getting plenty of air . miss marsh -- mrs. rosson .
thanks . i 'll be there . about seven-thirty ?	sooner -- if you like . see you again , i hope .
good afternoon --	glad to see you again .
i hope so .	that 's a date .
will you please excuse me ? i 'll be right back .	we 'll save you a place at our table .
is n't she lovely ?	yes -- and < u > very < /u > popular --
no -- i 'm furious ! -- nobody seems to do anything about it --	why worry ? it was insured -- how about that swimming lesson i promised you ?
how do you do . would you care to finish the game ? i have a slight earache . -- and it 's so noisy up here .	thanks , no . i despise any form of exercise . do n't forget we have an engagement for cocktails and cards .
you 're anya rosson , are n't you ? i 've heard of you back in new york .	sorry i ca n't return the compliment .
you were indiscreet enough to leave your gloves in my apartment one evening -- -- and he was gentleman enough to boast < u > why < /u > you 'd been there and show me a snapshot of you .	i do n't understand .
a rare pleasure to meet you , ma'am ! where i come from -- out in montana -- we have some pretty women , but i guess if you walked down main street they 'd turn out the fire brigade .	montana ?
-- that 's what we call double-a grade lumber , ma'am ; you do n't find a knot in a thousand feet .	is n't that interesting ?
you 'll excuse me .	well , it 'll have to be poker -- but i 'm so unlucky in that game .
will you pardon me ?	< u > gladly < /u > .
you 're lucky -- out my way , in montana , there 's nothing else to do --	i 'm going down to my cabin . i have to send a wireless -- see you later .
did you find it ?	no ! -- did < u > you < /u > take that bracelet ?
no-o !	where 's lother ?
where 'd you get it ?	lifted it out of a guy 's cabin last night .
what did you want a gun for ?	stick-up . needed dough to get ashore .
is that why you killed lee lother ?	guess again , copper .
hmm ! so am i. if you 'll excuse me i have some important unfinished business . i 'll see you all later .	we 'll be expecting you .
we have n't any chips , mr. brett -- do you mind playing with cash ?	not at all .
well , i 'm off to a pretty good start .	if i ever won a pot that large the boat would sink .
i should pass , but i 'll trail along -- i 'll take three .	i 'll bet a couple of hundred .
aces full .	and me coming in with two pair --
you 're coming back --	that depends on how mother 's feeling . you 'll excuse me , gentlemen ?
how about a little game later ?	fine -- i 'll be glad to .
could i see you a minute ?	sure ! excuse me .
no gentleman would do that .	i agree with you -- no gentleman , would -- but i would -- -- especially when my opponents have taken the precaution of marking the cards .
in that case -- you owe us exactly sixteen hundred dollars .	oh , no -- i played with < u > your < /u > cards -- in < u > your < /u > cabin -- at < u > your < /u > suggestion -- if you 've got a kick coming , make it to the purser .
and i 'll lay odds you got that bracelet .	i 'll lay odds you get a pair of 'em -- why , a high-school kid could take you saps -- and another thing -- lay off sally marsh . -- '' honest jack '' ! one look at your mug and the whole world buttons up its pockets .
i 'm so sorry !	want to take it back ?
i thought you were one of my friends .	i 'd < u > like < /u > to be . sailing on the < u > progress ? < /u >
yes -- are you ?	i would n't miss this boat for a million .
she looks like a lot of other boats . i grant you she 's beautiful .	i 'll say she is !
nice lines --	yes --
like her paint job ?	very much --
you 've got lipstick all over you .	i could stand some more --
-- you 'll have all the boys tipping their hats to you -- -- let me wipe it off .	no ! do n't touch it ! i want the < u > world < /u > to see my < u > shame < /u > .
where have you been hiding ?	oh -- hello ! i got the flowers . that was sweet of you -- thank you .
do n't thank me . do you recognize me without the lipstick ?	so you washed it off !
how about giving me another coat ?	good-by .
wait a minute ! -- they 're dancing in the palm court --	good-by !
there 's soft music --	-- sorry -- got an appointment to play shuffle-board .
this is great . i 'll be able to watch your act every night .	you 're not very ambitious , are you ?
oh , yes , i am , because < u > afterwards < /u > -- up here in the moonlight .	you work too fast for me , young man .
aw -- give a feller a break . my cards are on the table -- i want to know you . how about dining with me tonight ?	never eat before the show .
this is mr. -- er --	brett is the name .
do n't stop , nurse -- i think i 'm going to faint .	you < u > are < /u > a lunatic !
you know , you 're not a < u > bad < /u > -looking girl . in fact -- i think you 're lovely .	keep your eyes on the ball , mister .
married ?	nothing to speak of . what is this -- third degree ?
i want you to get used to my voice -- you 're going to hear it a lot .	what a horrible death ! do you know what you remind me of ?
tell me .	a little boy that has escaped from his nurse and --
is n't she attractive ?	very -- your mother ?
do n't be a c-a-t .	you asked me to dine with you tonight .
yes ?	well , i ca n't .
do n't rub it in .	but i 'll have cocktails with you .
when ?	at seven-thirty ?
sooner it you like .	okay .
fatal fascination of james brett wins out .	wrong again -- but i dislike possessive women .
see you at seven-thirty in the lounge .	i 'll be there -- good-by .
i 'm sorry i 'm late , but something happened .	you 're forgiven if you do n't make dates with anybody except me for the rest of the voyage .
a little .	sorry .
thanks .	anything i can do ? i 'd jump overboard if it 'd help you .
mighty decent of you , pal .	decent ? i guess any guy could be decent -- if you were interested .
what are you thinking ?	a lot of things i 'd like to forget .
that 's funny -- so was i. guess the ocean makes one sentimental	i ca n't blame the ocean -- it 's you .
do n't kid me . i 'm in no mood for it .	for once i 'm dead on the level -- -- crazy about you !
will you take some advice ? if you 're looking for romance -- count me out -- -- if you know what 's good for you .	but --
-- i know what i 'm talking about . i 'm no high-school girl looking through a window -- reaching for the moon . guess i 'll be going .	sally -- !
let 's forget it -- ca n't you see i kind of like you , too ... and i do n't want to get involved .	you mean that ?
do n't let 's talk about it .	you said it ! how about a little action ?
would you like to take a turn around the deck with me ?	yes -- is it all right if i come like this ?
this time i 'm really glad you showed up .	lonesome ?
what , again ?	yes -- you know what i 've been thinking , sally ? --
what ? --	i think we 'll live in europe after we 're married ?
i did n't < u > know < /u > we were < u > going < /u > to be married .	you did n't ? -- i guess i forgot to tell you --
you 're a little ahead of yourself -- the usual routine would be for you to propose , and if i accept , then you 'd give me an engagement ring --	i 'll give you plenty of rings as soon as i get the stones set -- what do you think ?
good night , mrs. brett !	good night , idiot !
i could see you were pining away --	oh , that 's mrs. rosson -- remember , you met her yesterday ?
how well do you know her ?	just met her on the boat -- supposed to play bridge with her yesterday -- but she would n't -- so we played poker instead .
who with ?	a mr. summers and a man called lother .
oh , you infant ! how much did you lose ?	lose ? -- i won a little --
that was the come-on -- promise me you wo n't play with them again --	what do you know about them ?
too much -- remember -- i warned you about me -- i used to be lee lother 's girl --	you can live that down , ca n't you ?
you ca n't lose me , sally -- i 'm no lily myself !	i 'm beginning to think you 're a pretty swell guy .
i 'll change and be with you in ten minutes .	make it five .
seven-fifty . positively my last offer .	i 'll be waiting on deck .
i 'm going to return the bracelet right now and face the consequences .	jimmy !
well , i 'll be -- ! ! !	what 's the matter ?
not here -- follow me around the shed .	do n't you know better than to talk to me with people around ?
oh , putting on the swell , eh ?	i thought you were a smart guy .
if i was smart i would n't be working my way over on this ship .	we did n't have enough dough for two tickets , did we ?
we coulda got two third-class !	no bank roll there , boy . lucky i could get you signed on -- they picked up that pittsburgh jeweler -- made him talk . the heat 's on , shortie -- and those atlantic breezes are going to be mighty welcome .
oh , i 'm not squawkin ' , but i 'm not used to working and it 's a bad habit to get into .	it 'll never hurt you -- -got any money ?
a dollar seventy and i 'm gon na keep it !	no , you 're not . give me that dollar seventy .
nix , the law !	yes , sir ! -- i will , sir -- certainly , sir !
he 's a colored man in chauffeur 's uniform carrying a basket of fruit .	i 'll watch for him , sir .
quick , let me have that money . i 'm broke and i 'll need it for tips .	oh , no -- you 're not gon na give my hard-earned money away .
you 're a wise guy -- gim me back --	shortie , look !
you do n't think -- ?	looks like he 's taking a trip -- see the baggage ? the only time they ever picked me up , mckinney walked through the room while they were grilling -- let 's see how good his memory is .
yer lucky i 'm here at all . i tell you , jimmy -- my feet 'll never hold out .	stop squawking ! you were doing this job on a ship four years ago when i first picked you up , were n't you ?
yeah -- but high livin 's made me soft .	how 're the tips ?
a dollar forty .	i 'll need it -- gave my last buck to the bedroom steward .
not a chance .	come on -- i 'll promote a card game , and we 'll be sitting pretty .
until then -- the dollar forty stays with me .	is that a nice way to talk to a pal ?
oh , shortie ! -- -- there 's a girl on this ship --	-- there 's thousands of 'em !
this is a business trip !	she was wearing a white dress with a cute , black hat -- and carrying a bag with s. m. on it . funny -- her name 's not on the passenger list .
maybe she 's in the show -- one of the troupers -- did you ever think of that ?	why < u > did n't < /u > i think of that ? -- i am going to scout around and see if i can find her .
just a minute , steward -- have n't you forgotten something ?	no , sir ?
my change .	change ?
shortie ! -- you know my motto ?	pleasure first if it do n't interfere with business .
right ! -- but it does n't have to apply to you -- keep your eyes open for anybody wearing a lot of cracked ice and give me the office .	now you 're talkin ' !
inspector mckinney .	are you screwy ?
i fell in his arms -- could n't resist it .	you know where that sense of humor 's goin ' to get you one of these days --
here -- drop it where they 'll find it and return it to him . he 's not a bad egg . i 'll ship him back the fifty before we arrive .	you take some awful chances .
they wo n't squawk -- they 're professionals .	well , if that 's the case , you 're sure of winning the first couple of hands -- but what about after that ?
have the purser give you twenty-five hundred dollars for this check -- and bring the cash here .	yes , mr. brett -- right away .
here 's your twenty-five hundred , mr. brett .	thank you . i owe you a dollar forty -- here -- keep the change .
thank you , sir .	i 'll take one .
sorry to interrupt you , mr brett , but i have a message for you .	what is it ?
your mother is feeling seasick and would like to see you right away .	oh , is she ? what a shame ! you 'll pardon me ?
about sixteen hundred .	partners , ai n't we ?
you keep it --	< u > me < /u > !
say -- wait a minute !	see you later , shortie -- i 'm off to the pool .
hello , jimmy . what 's up ?	listen , runt -- quick ! where 's the ice ?
why -- i -- er thought with all this heat turned on i 'd hide it .	where did you hide it ?
on the drunk .	get it !
come in !	hope i did n't keep you waiting .
i 'll bet a couple of hundred -- i wonder what 's keeping that boy .	do n't worry about that . we 'll settle after the hand . out in montana where i come from a man 's word is all that 's necessary . what have you got ?
three jacks .	that beats two pairs . i 'm glad < u > i < /u > did n't win the first pot . take the money , mr. brett .
it 's your deal .	it 's a pleasure .
how 's your mother feeling ?	much better -- thank you --
well , to tell you the truth , gentlemen , i 've sworn off playing poker .	why , you would n't quit when you 're ahead , would you ?
i thought you were a sucker --	think again --
that goes two ways .	make it three , boys -- i 'll play this hand pat .
i think i 've met you before , mr. brett .	oh , yes . on the pier .
before that . your face is very familiar .	yours , too . are you the mckinney , the dentist on calumet avenue in chicago ?
i 'm going to the show --	i 'll go with you --
care to join us ?	no , thanks -- i never gambled in my life .
this is exciting -- but if it 's been stolen they ca n't get away with it on a ship --	some of the smartest robberies have taken place aboard ships --
it 'll be very interesting to see how you go about solving this , inspector --	sorry -- but i 'm on a vacation --
if he lets you down i 'll try my hand at sleuthing -- bet i could find that bracelet --	i would n't be surprised --
i would n't worry about it -- it 'll turn up -- how about a nightcap , inspector ?	no , thanks -- i 'll take a walk around the deck and then turn in --
thought you were going to turn in , inspector .	nervous . could n't sleep . feel like a nightcap ?
how about you ?	no , thanks . i 've promised to play cards .
you know what i 'd do , if i were you -- before the card game i 'd go to the purser 's office .	why ?
well , someone else besides myself may have seen you in the vicinity of mrs. rosson 's cabin this evening -- even the stewards in that corridor insisted on being searched . get me ?	sure , i 'll go .
i 'll go with you .	swell !
it 's easy to see the purser has n't had much practice .	how about trying your fine italian hand ?
this has nothing to do with me -- but always remember , purser , when you 're searching anybody , take the lining of their coat , like this -- -- run your fingers all along these seams ... . then -- back of the collar -- < u > here < /u > -- that used to be a favorite trick -- and never forget to put your finger down inside of the shoe -- like this .	hey ! -- you 're tickling me .
hello , young fellow !	coming to the pool for a swim ?
would n't bet against her . tell you what i will do -- bet you i find that bracelet before we hit france . not a hundred , though -- just fifty .	it 's a bet -- come on , sally !
nice girl , that -- i 'd hate to see < u > her < /u > get a raw deal . you know , the great trouble with crooks is they 're < u > too < /u > smart . now if i 'd taken that bracelet , i 'd find some way to slip it back -- i 'd know i could never get ashore with it .	anybody that 's taken the trouble to get it would be a mug to put it back .
thought you might need me -- do n't talk , kid , and do n't let him scare you --	do n't be too smart , jimmy -- you 're out in the rough yourself . you had an argument with lother a couple of hours before he was killed -- but i 'll deal with that later --
do n't get yourself all worked up --	you keep out of this -- you admit you thought of killing him -- how were you going to do it ?
mmmmmmmmmhm ... . now , jimmy , what were you doing in that corridor before the shots were fired ?	why , i --
here 's your fifty .	thanks . that makes us square .
their faces are familiar -- but not to each other .	now that that 's settled , why not make the game a foursome ?
no -- i 'll take sally and give you the best of it .	tell you what i 'll do . i 'll toss you for her -- heads she plays with me .
that 's too bad .	i 'm o.k . it did n't hurt much .
that 's all right . i 'll attend to this .	wait a minute -- let 's match for it .
oh , denby -- have you seen sally around ?	no -- i 'm looking for miss marsh myself . i thought you might know where she is --
she was to meet me here -- why do n't you wait ? she ought to be here any minute .	i would -- but our rehearsal starts right away . before i go i want to ask you a little favor . sally is an important part of my show . some day -- not now -- when you get a chance -- let her come to just one rehearsal . i 'll appreciate it .
i do n't know what it is , but i wo n't use it . is she entertaining you ?	i should say not .
i wo n't -- i 'll ask for one right now . sally tells me she 's in love with you .	she did ?
yes -- but do n't ask me why -- because i could never tell you . i do n't know what most guys want out of life -- but < u > that < /u > would be enough for me -- i would n't care about -- easy money -- or -- showing off my smart brains -- i 'd just like to live < u > my < /u > life so nothing i did would bounce back and ruin < u > hers < /u > -- do i make myself clear ?	very clear . that 's one favor i 'll be glad to do you .
o.k. , kid -- i 'm only sorry for one thing .	what 's that ?
here you are , sir .	what 'll i say ?
eighty cents a word -- three -- six -- nine words . that 'll be seven twenty , but it 's too much -- i 'll show you how to save some money .	how ?
where do you live ?	in new york .
your wife knows that , do n't she ?	sure .
`` will be back in four weeks '' -- -- that saves you eighty cents right there !	that 's right -- here 's the eighty cents for you . i 'd rather see you get it than the company -- send it right off .
wait a minute -- i think i can cut out a couple o ' more words .	how ?
`` will -- be -- back -- in -- four -- weeks . '' you do n't need the `` will be . '' just say `` back in four weeks . ''	that 's right . i owe you a dollar sixty .
wait a minute -- i think i can cut something else out . `` back in four weeks . '' instead of `` in four weeks '' -- say `` next month '' -- that saves another word .	right . here 's eighty cents . send it .
just a minute -- i do n't think we need the word `` back '' -- where < u > is < /u > `` back '' ?	back is in new york .
your wife knows that , do n't she ?	sure .
now we get it down to two words -- '' next month . ''	send that .
wait a minute -- what < u > is < /u > next month ?	next month is june .
fine ! instead of saying `` next month '' -- we 'll use one word and say `` june . ''	june ? that 's my wife 's name .
that 's great ! there 's the address and message all in one word .	o.k. ! send that !
just a minute -- your wife knows her own name , does n't she ?	sure .
well , there 's no use in sending it . see that -- i saved you seven twenty !	well . i 'd rather see < u > you < /u > get it than the company .
i 'll say -- how fast is this boat going ?	oh , -- we 're doing about thirty --
pretty good -- thirty < u > miles < /u > an hour --	no . < u > knots < /u > !
what ?	knots !
that 's me !	not the < u > real < /u > chad denby ? --
yes -- me -- in person !	so what ?
i can see where i wo n't talk much to you .	< u > nuts < /u > to you too !
hello , denby !	i thought i put you to bed .
oh , was that me you put to bed ? thanks . i 've been looking all over for you .	well , did you find me ?
not yet . say , where is this boat headed for ?	this is a fine time to be asking that . you 're on your way to france .
hey , boy -- give this man a cablegram blank . where is your wife ?	she 's in new york .
tell her you 're on your way to france and will be back in four weeks .	that 's fine .
come on , get up . that horse is carrying too much of a load .	who won ?
well , you got the first down -- there 's one more to go . come on , we 're ready to start right now . come on . just keep stiff .	i was never stiffer in my life .
he 's funny -- maybe you can use him in the show , mr. denby .	< u > denby ! < /u > -- are you chad denby ?
oh , there you are --	that 's right -- you 're the one i was looking for . you 'll excuse me . how about you and i being alone ?
not now , toots -- which is the right way to say this ? you 're dumber than me -- or -- you 're dumber than i ?	let me see now -- do n't tell me -- you 're dumber than me and i 'm dumber than you . i do n't get it .
mckinney 's the name .	miss marsh .
here we are , folks -- eighty thousand wild-eyed fans go mad -- they go mad as chad denby -- with the arms of iron , and the nerves of steel -- picks up his racket -- what is this thing -- a racket or a mallet ?	looks to me like standard equipment for the department of street cleaning --
you can always tell how much a man 's traveled by the way he plays shuffle-board .	yeah -- if he 'd only stick to shuffle-board .
those kids seem to be getting along fine ! --	it must be the sea air -- it gets everybody .
he 's a likable chap -- he 's got an honest face --	it 's all right -- if you like honest faces -- let 's have another drink -- steward !
hello , inspector -- i hear your vacation 's been spoiled . somebody lost a bracelet .	yes , a bracelet 's been lost , but i 'm still on my vacation .
i understand you searched brett for it last night . by the way -- what do you know about him ?	well , i 've seen him here and there . what 's on your mind ?
oh , nothing -- only i wondered why you suspected him .	well , i 'll tell you -- we picked him up about a year ago -- but could never pin anything on him .
maybe he just travels in bad company .	yeah --
i did n't --	he asked for a loan of it , did n't he ?
yes -- but i did n't give it to him --	is this your gun ?
well , that 's something -- even if only the fish can see it .	are you happy ?
am i a member of this club ?	you 're the president . come in ! your brother was just telling me a few jokes i can use on the radio --
are you paying any attention to his jokes ? -- the first thing you know , you 'll be taking piano lessons from venus de milo -- get out of here .	everything o.k . ?
looks like your old workshop back on 42nd street .	like it ?
swell -- you 've got times square right here -- all but the noises --	yep -- spending lots of time aboard -- you see , sally , i sold this transatlantic idea to the shipping company .
and you 've put it over -- have n't you ?	why not ? i give 'em a great show -- and you know -- we 're doing capacity , sally -- and all < u > nice < /u > people --
you never fail at anything , do you , chad ?	no -- not much -- excepting --
still got my picture , i see -- i was pretty dumb then , was n't i , chad ?	no -- inexperienced -- a red-headed kid -- homemade clothes -- broadway was paradise -- and a slot at the automat was a banquet .
i came to tell you what a swell guy i think you are to do this --	do what --
you made it possible for us to get away at a few hours ' notice -- you never asked why , but i guess you know .	news travels fast on broadway -- you had to get away from a rat --
it was n't only that -- ned was in a jam .	i get it -- lee lother have a hand in that , too ?
i was so crazy about him -- anything he did or said was o.k . by me . i introduced him to people -- even after i knew his stock promoting was phoney and the card games were crooked . it did n't seem to matter -- i did n't care -- -- until he roped ned in . some confidence game -- and the kid left his fingerprints on a drinking glass .	i felt pretty low , sally , when i heard you were running around with a racketeer --
women have a curious taste for knickknacks . when i found out about ned -- tried to make a break -- lee would n't stand for it and -- well -- here i am !	stay on the other side of the pond for a couple of months -- you 'll soon forget all about it .
chad denby broadcasting -- -- the nicest man i ever knew --	but not nice enough to marry -- eh ?
come on , now -- you 've forgotten all about that .	i 'll never love anybody else .
women are such fools ! -- why do so many of us pass up < u > right < /u > guys ?	guess they 're dull -- nothing for you to reform .
you 're just a master of ceremonies . he might have knocked his head off .	what 's the difference ? he 's got more heads than he needs .
i do n't get the humor of that remark .	< u > he < /u > does . here 's your quarter , brett .
yes .	very serious ?
why -- do n't you like him ?	of course -- but -- there 's your cue -- hurry up --
i 'll give you another chance to tell the truth , lother .	what do you mean ?
why do n't you be a good little boy and leave her alone ?	oh -- i understand you were an important part of her education when she came to new york .
i just tried to show her the difference between the squirrels and the skunks .	meaning what ?
yep -- everybody 's having a good time but me -- what do you want , mary ?	i just wrote a poem about the atlantic ocean --
but , mary -- everybody 's having such a great time -- why spoil it ?	somebody 's got to do it --
well , let 's hear the poem --	oh , you dear atlantic ocean -- how you spread across the sea -- from new york to dear old europe -- just for boats to ride on thee --
very good , mary --	but i 'm not finished yet -- -- and your waves are so colossal -- rocking boats both to and fro -- oh-h , atlantic , how i love you -- -- how i love you --
what 's the matter , mary ?	i 'm getting seasick --
h'mm -- < u > dear < /u > atlantic --	mr. denby -- what do you think i ought to do with that part ?
oh , mr. den-n-by !	everyone but me -- what do you want now , mary ?
i feel better now -- i 've got a riddle ! when is a plate of bean soup not a plate of bean soup ?	all right . when < u > is < /u > a plate of bean soup not a plate of noodle soup ?
when it falls off the table and turns turtle -- cute ?	mary -- fall off the boat and turn to the left --
with your dry wit and humor --	oh yeah ? -- my personality put this thing over --
maurice chevalier ! there 's a fellow with personality .	what 's he got that i have n't got ?
well , he has a straw hat --	so have i -- i can get it right out of my trunk .
-- and he has sex appeal .	so what ?
get that out of your trunk .	all right -- do n't spoil the trip with any of those jokes -- there 's a nice bunch of people on this trip -- nothing but class -- i looked over the passenger list and they 're all members of the who 's who !
never mind the who 's who -- before i get on this boat i want to know what 's what ! how about my raise ? all i get out of these ocean trips is dizzy .	do n't blame it on the ocean ! -- all right , you 'll get the raise !
is that one of the who 's who ?	no -- he 's probably one of the `` here 's how . '' take it easy -- the ocean 's pretty rough today --
h'mm ... no wonder i have trouble rounding up this show -- do n't you know there 's a rehearsal going on ? -- and you wanted a raise. -- come on -- get going or you 'll get it !	oh , all right -- see you later , toots .
oh , chad -- what about the rest of the show ?	oh , -- i was having so much fun i almost forgot --
oh , mr. denby , i wrote a poem about a bracelet --	good-night , folks .
then , after the first number , i tell the one about the scotchman trying to open a pullman window -- the scotchman says to the window -- '' gee you 're tight . '' -- and the window says -- '' you loosen up a bit and so will i . '' -- good ? -- and then i do the one -- oh -- you do n't like it , eh ?	chad -- lother 's on the boat , and i 'm worried sick about sally --
oh ! -- so that 's it . does she know he 's on board ?	no -- but i 'm going to keep my eye on --
what happened to you ?	you 've got a gun , have n't you , chad ? will you let me have it ?
what for ?	do n't ask any questions -- just give it to me .
you 're wasting your time -- she 's a friend of mine .	eh ? ... oh .
he works the boats as a `` come-on '' man . we ought to make a fair combination and do a little business . jack 's a pretty good dealer himself .	there 's a lot of trout in this stream just waitin ' for a fly . i 've already been workin ' on a young fellow from chicago -- related to one of the big packin ' families -- on his way to biarritz for a good time . likes a little game of bridge and poker .
that 's him ! that 's the sucker ! !	looks lonesome -- bring him over here .
can you read 'em jack ?	they 're a cinch to read -- queen of clubs -- -- ace of diamonds .
the man that marks them is an artist -- two hundred and fifty bucks for six decks -- and they 're worth it .	the country boy 's about due .
out my way in montana we always call a bluff .	well , i helped my hand so i 'll have to see you .
how much did you lose ?	about twelve hundred .
i went for four .	it 's a long trip and we 'll get that sucker later .
all right -- but what is there to face ? it 's finished .	you ran away because you were afraid . i do n't want it to end like that .
i did n't want to see you again -- that 's my privilege .	it was n't smart . even if you 'd gotten away without me -- i 'd have found you -- no matter where you were .
why do n't you leave me alone ?	because i want you -- will always want you -- no other woman 'll ever take your place . i want you more now than i did that first night -- you 've forgotten all that , i suppose ?
i wish i could .	get wise to yourself , sally -- you 're no sob story .
you get wise to < u > yourself < /u > ! if you know what 's good for you , you 'll leave me alone . everybody 's entitled to one mistake -- well -- you 're mine . when the going got too rough , i pulled up stakes and quit . we stay quit ! -- get that ! -- and what 're you going to do about it ?	that 's more like the old sally -- a little bit of fire . how about ned ?
he 's all right .	thanks to me .
you leave the kid alone .	a tipoff in the right quarter to take his fingerprints and --
-- you 'd go with him !	do n't kid yourself -- you know how i stand back there .
not because of ned .	of course not -- -- but is n't it a coincidence that he 's from the eighteenth precinct -- where they made the squawk ?
i 'm crazy about the kid and i got him into it . what do you want me to do ?	just smile again and be reasonable . i 'll order dinner here -- just the two of us -- like old times .
-- and you swear when you get to the other side , you 'll never come near either of us again ?	that 's a bet -- but i could n't let you walk out like that , sally . i 'd have gone cuckoo back there -- just thinking about you --
do n't , lee -- that 's dead .	let 's see if i can bring it back to life .
go ahead -- you did n't used to be so fussy --	i 've lost my taste for knickknacks --
do n't be a mug all your life -- i 'm trying to help you -- you need me more than i need you -- have you figured they might pick the kid up in france and extradite him ?	have you ever figured they might extradite you ?
i know he is . you change those clothes and then come to my cabin . i 'll expect you around twelve o'clock .	not a chance -- i 'm through .
yes , yes !	you did n't have a gun in your hand last night ?
no !	s'pose you 've never thought of killing him --
i would n't say that -- i 'm glad he 's dead -- yes -- i 'd thought of killing him -- but i did n't --	why ?
i tried to borrow a gun from chad , but --	this is interesting -- why did n't you tell me you gave this kid your gun last night ?
it 's getting kind of chilly on deck . if you 'll excuse me , i think i 'll go to bed . good night , mr. mckinney !	good night !
congratulations .	exciting , was n't it ? where 's jimmy ?
he 'll be back . what would you do if anybody gave you a bracelet ?	say , `` thanks very much ! ''
i mean if you knew it were stolen .	well , of course , i would n't take it .
and if you liked the person , you 'd naturally persuade him to give it back and go straight , would n't you ?	sure i would -- but i do n't get what you 're driving at .
that 's the truth -- every single word !	i sincerely hope so --
why should < u > i < /u > kill him ?	for a very excellent reason from your own admission -- -- i 'm not saying you < u > did < /u > -- but i think you know more than you 're telling . years of experience have taught me to mistrust circumstantial evidence . nevertheless , in your case there 's plenty of it .
soon as i get that bracelet back i 'm going to relax . wish the guy that borrowed it would help me out -- i got to win that fifty bucks .	i 've got a hunch you 're going to win that bet , inspector .
next time i get a vacation i 'll spend it at headquarters . good-night .	he 's a swell person . he told me he 'd rather turn one guy straight than jug a million .
there you are , sir .	thank you .
he 's certainly good-natured .	`` smooth 's '' the word .
i mean -- a lot of gentlemen would be offended if you searched them like that .	it all depends on what you 're used to .
well , i 'll be a son of a sea cook !	what 's the matter ?
i thought i had our sailing covered up -- -- and here it is .	do you think lother could have seen it ?
is n't it great to be away from it all ? are n't you happy ? it seems too good to be true .	sure , sis .
i 'm all right .	you saw him sitting out there in front , did n't you ?
i was in his cabin --	what ! -- are you crazy ?
i 'll explain later --	if he comes near you again , i 'll break his neck --
everything in order , sir ? what are < u > you < /u > doing here , my lad ?	telegrams .
nothin ' .	let me look at it .
ai n't got time .	hey -- you ! where you going ?
i tell yuh i ai n't got no bracelet --	i saw him take the bracelet out of that shoe .
yer crazy ! -- i ai n't got no bracelet .	then why did you run away ?
i said that 's 500 to you , holliday . in or out ?	500 ? sly boots , must be a peach of a hand .
oh , for christ 's sake !	ed bailey , you look like you 're just ready to burst . well call me a fool but i guess i 'll just have to call . cover your ears , darling .
god damn son of a ...	is n't that a daisy ?
just pick up your money and go . sick of listening to you simper .	now ed , are we cross ?
skinny lunger , your guns do n't impress me . was n't for those guns you 'd be nothin ' .	why ed , what an ugly thing to say ! does this mean you 're not my friend anymore ? you know , ed , if i thought you were n't my friend i do n't think i could bear it .
oh , my god ...	does it hurt ? a lot ? good .
newcomers , eh ? names john behan , i 'm cochise county sheriff . just hit town ?	just this minute . i 'm wyatt earp , these 're my brothers-
wyatt earp ... dodge city , right ?	gave all that up . going into business .
so how 's tombstone treating you ?	fine , fine . but i was thinkin ' , you know what this town really needs is a race track .
what d'you think of the singer ?	nice voice .
the man dealing faro . who is he ?	that 's wyatt earp . made quite a name for himself as a peace officer in kansas .
a peace officer ... impressive man	yes , very . and very married .
well i guess you can see , never a dull moment . maybe you should stay around to see what happens next . who know ? you might find a future here .	maybe even my destiny .
i saw that look on your face just now . what 's between you and wyatt ?	absolutely nothing .
listen , i want to talk to you .	not now . i do n't have time .
i saw that look pass between you and wyatt at the fight . listen to me ! you 're mine ! understand ? you 're my woman and i 'm your man .	my man ? you told wyatt you 'd disarmed those men . do you actually believe after that i could see you as my man ? you 're just a dirty little fixer .
easy . i just wanted to tell you things 're about to start changing around here . lots of so-called hard cases and tough-nuts swagger around this town but none of 'em 's got a clue about the real play . none of 'em .	i do n't understand .
he said to turn loose of him .	well i 'm not so go home .
where 'd you get that horse ?	beauty , ai n't he ?
i asked where you got him .	where do you think ? i stole him .
look , i do n't want any trouble with you but that 's my horse and i mean to have him back . one way or another .	come and get him .
what 'd the messican mean , a sick horse 's gon na get us ? did n't make no sense .	he was quoting the bible , revelations : `` behold a pale horse and the one that sat on him was death and hell followed with him . ''
shut up , ike .	and you must be doc holliday .
i want them spitting blood !	easy , johnny . now ai n't the time . i tell you , boys , even i 'm worried what 'll happen once ringo runs this outfit ! god have mercy !
there 's no god , there 's no devil , i hate the god damn world ! i want to die !	easy , son . you just need to get your feet back under you , that 's all . come on , boy , let 's kick south . down to the old playground .
hey , you smell that ? smells like something died .	oh , jesus , johnny ...
i 'm retired .	good . that 's real good .
come on , you ...	crack me back of the head like some stinkin ' bull . hell , you ai n't no fightin ' man , you 're just a cop .
feel bad about ol ' fred . just ca n't hold back when i 'm feelin ' woolly . still , feel kinda bad . but now we 're square . anyway no use for holdin ' a grudge . i deserved a rap in the head .	make you a deal . my brother took over the marshal 's office in tombstone . got it in his head he 's gon na make the place safe for widows and orphans . you and your boys stay out of his way , i 'll make sure he stays out of yours .
fair enough . you know i got to admit , you got a lot of bark on you comin ' up here like this .	they were all gon na jump me back there . what ever happened to one against one ?
ai n't our way . we go all on one , one on all . fight one of us , you fight us all . that 's the cowboy way .	and how come you call yourselves cowboys ? cowhands ride for the brand .
oh , we ride for a brand all right . this brand . how 'bout you ?	this brand .
i 'm sorry . if there was any other-	i know . just did what you had to . that banner and stuff , that 's just ike . do n't worry about it .
i want you to know it 's over . we 're leaving and we 're not coming back .	well ... 'bye .
look at that ! yeah ! come and get some , boy !	no ...
let me , let me , yeah ! die , you bastard ...	no ...
forget it .	excuse me ?
i said forget it , answer 's no , i do n't want the job and that 's final . i 'm going to tombstone and nothin ' short of dyin 's gonn stop me . good day .	but wait , you do n't understand-
no marshal , you do n't understand . i 'm through with lawing , i 'm through with the whole proposition . forever . i did my duty , now i 'd like to get on with my life . that is if you do n't mind . jesus . good day now .	i see , off to strike it rich , huh . all right , fine , wish you luck . tell you this though , never was a rich man yet did n't wind up with a guilty conscience .
that 's the rumor .	you retired , too ?
not me . i 'm in my prime .	yeah , you look it .
age quod agis .	credat judaeus apella .
ecentus stultorum magister .	in pace requiescat .
that 's just my game .	all right , lunger . have at it .
on three ? you call it .	here it come : one-two-
why johnny ringo , you look like somebody just walked over your grave . oh , i was n't quite as sick as i made out .	my fight 's not with you , holliday .
i beg to differ . we started a fight we never got to finish . play for blood , remember ?	i was kidding about that .
all right , lunger . let 's do it .	say when .
here , doc .	bless you , darling darling ! are you mad ? you 're not wearing a bustle . how lewd !
i calculate that 's the end of this town . and let 's do n't bother about the luggage , darling .	i been having the boy at the hotel pack us up every night since your streak started
you do n't even know him .	yes , but there 's just something about him . something around the eyes , i do n't know , reminds me of ... me . no . i 'm sure of it , i hate him .
that 's my lovin ' man . just ca n't get enough .	enough ? never .
what 's wrong , doc ?	nothing . not a thing . i 'm right as the mail .
how you feeling , doc ?	better .
we must talk , darling . it appears we have to ... redefine the nature of our association .	what 's that mean , doc ? you know i do n't understand when you talk up high like that . you mean you do n't want to be my lovin ' man no more ?
not exactly ...	i 'm a good woman to you , doc . do n't i always take care of you ? nobody cares for you like me . i 'm a good woman .
doc ! how the hell are you ?	perfect , wyatt . simply perfect .
since when is faro a business ?	did n't you always say gambling 's an honest trade ?
i said poker 's an honest trade . only suckers buck the tiger . the odds are all with the house .	depends how you look at it . i mean it 's not like anybody 's holding a gun to their heads .
sheriff behan , doc holliday .	forgive me if i do n't shake hands .
very cosmopolitan .	i know him . that 's creek johnson .
very instructive	but who was the devil ?
so now we 're in the mining business . turning into regular tycoons . gon na call this one the mattie blaylock . mattie 'll get a kick out of that , it 's her maiden name .	and what a maiden , pure as the driven snow , i 'm sure .
so tell me , wyatt . i 'm curious . do you actually consider youself a married man ? forsaking all others ?	well yeah . pretty much . i mean i was no angel when we met but people change doc . i mean sooner or later you got ta grow up .
i see . and what would you do if `` she '' walked in her right now ? wyatt `` she '' ?	you know damn well who i mean . that dusky-hued lady satan .
i do n't know . probably ignore her .	ignore her ?
i 'd ignore her . people can change , doc .	i 'll remember you said that .
satisfied ?	i stand corrected . wyatt . you 're an oak .
he 's drunk .	in vino veritas .
maybe i ought to go out there .	you will or you wo n't . do n't look to me . i 'm going to sleep .
wyatt ! just in time . pull up a chair .	been hittin ' it awful hard , doc .
nonsense , i have not yet begun to defile myself .	but doc-
i wo n't be pawed at , thank you very much	sorry , sorry ...
it appears he missed an excellent chance to keep his mouth shut .	felt his liver go on that last one . get him to a doctor or he 'll be dead in a couple hours .
wyatt , my god ! you 're shot to pieces !	no ...
i 'm a man without fear , wyatt . i literally do n't care if i live or die . but even i ca n't fight human instinct . somebody suddenly starts shooting at me , i duck . but you ... what on earth were you thinking about ?	i do n't know . it all happened so fast . if i 'd had a chance to think about it i guess i probably would 've been scared but ... swear to god , doc , i just do n't know .
doc ...	do n't touch me , god damn it ! just do n't touch me ! come on ...
what makes a man like ringo , doc ? what makes him do the things he does ?	a man like ringo 's got a great empty hole right through the middle of him and no matter what he does he ca n't ever fill it . he ca n't kill enough or steal enough or inflict enough pain to ever fill it . and it drives him mad . sick mad . cold and dirty .
so what does he want ?	what does he want ? he wants revenge .
i 'm sorry . i 'm sorry , wyatt . god , i 'm so sorry .	that 's all right , doc . do n't worry .
well hell , wyatt . wyatt , i want you to meet father feeney . father feeney 's just been initiating me into the mysteries of the great and ancient church of rome . you see , it appears my hypocrisy knows no bounds .	how you feelin ' , doc ?
rather an obvious question under the circumstances , do n't you agree ? a better one might be how do you feel ?	hurts . hurts pretty bad .
i imagine it would , yes . so now we can add self-pity to your list of frailties .	all right , doc ...
you think i 'm kidding . you 're the most fallible , wrong-headed , self- deluding , just generally benighted jackass i 've ever known . yet , withal , even at your worst , you 're the only human being in my entire life who ever gave me hope .	all i ever wanted was to live a normal life .
when will you wake up ? you would n't know a normal life if it bit you in the ass .	that 's great coming from you .
i played the cards i was dealt , wyatt . your problem is you 're always trying to play someone else 's . allow me to tell you the truth and thus set you free : there is no happiness , wyatt there is no normal life . there 's only life , that 's all . just life . the rest is relative .	then what do i do ?
first you can grab that black- haired woman and make her your own .	all right . then what ?
hey , is that `` old dog tray '' ? sounds like `` old dog tray '' .	what ?
you know , stephen foster . `` oh , susanna '' . `` camptown races '' , stephen-stinkin'-foster !	i see , well this happens to be a nocturne .
a which ?	you know , frederic-fucking-chopin .
drunks . crawfished a bet , called him a liar . i saw the whole thing .	sheriff , may i present a pair of fellow sophisticates , turkey creek jack johnson and texas jack vermillion ? watch your ear , creek .
do n't touch me !	sorry ...
you really look awful .	not half as bad as i feel .
then why in hell 're you doin ' this ? you ought to be in bed .	wyatt earp is my friend .
hell , i got lot 's of friends .	i do n't .
i do n't believe it . he 's clean !	what ? but i saw 'em-
all right , i 'm on fire ! black seven , seven stickin ' spades . let 's go !	i 'm your man ... you win again . well played , sir . you are on fire .
told you . i 'm red hot , i 'm blazin ' ! now , red seven . seven stinkin ' diamonds . look out ! five thousand ! let 's go !	awful lot of money .
ca n't take the heat , get outta the kitchen .	you 're the doctor . sad news , friend .
hello , wyatt ! hiya doc !	what was that all about ?
are you out of your mind ? what on earth 'd make us-	i 'll pay you 500 each in advance and i 'll mount you on those .
maybe you ought to have a talk with doc , wyatt . i do n't know if he 's gon na make it .	there 's no reasoning with him .
no .	what ?
see how she breezed out of here . like she had wings . funny thing but i ca n't really remember how she looked . i can remember parts of her clear as crystal , her mouth , her walk , how she shut her eyes when she laughed , little bits and pieces , but not the whole package . ca n't put it together for some reason .	good god , you 're really-
you tell ringo ... just tell him i 'll be there .	wyatt , are you crazy ?
but i 'd do it , i 'd get that one into him . so help me god , i would .	all right wyatt , maybe you can . but you got ta die to do it . understand ? you got ta die !
wyatt , i ... i ai n't got the words .	i know . me neither .
all right , what 's it to be ? new mexico 's that way .	colorado 's closer
there they go . look kinda like preachers .	yeah . or undertakers .
you know , we might just pull this off .	not so sure . somethin ' tells me it gets harder from here in . should 've held out for more money .
yeah , better run , you bastards !	how is he ?
hey creek , you ever see anything like that before ?	never even heard of anything like it .
wyatt , listen , you ca n't beat him . you 're good and god knows you got the courage , but you ai n't in ringo 's class . hell , he 's the best that 's ever been . 'cept maybe for wild bill .	he 's right , wyatt . ringo could put five into you before you could even get one into him .
praise jesus !	i 'll be dipped in shit . i will , too .
we 're the law , ai n't we ? well the law do n't ride around vermin-	it rides right at 'em . like mcmasters said , see it through to the end .
we 've never actually met . my name's-	wyatt earp , i know . i was beginning to think we 'd never meet . this is fortuitous . that means lucky .
what is it ?	easy now ... that mare 's in season .
oh ... now she 's starting . how do they know ?	they know . it 's the scent . we better split 'em up .
that was lovely !	you know you almost got us both killed back there ?
fun though , was n't it ?	you 'd die for fun ?
would n't you ? you 're laughing ! i was sure you never laughed .	i laugh sometimes
yes , but how often ? tell me , are you happy ?	am i happy ? i do n't know . happy as the next man , i guess . i do n't laugh all day long like an idiot , if that 's what you mean .
you 're a little touchy about it .	i 'm not touchy , i just , it 's a silly question , that 's all . am i happy ? are you happy ?
of course , i 'm always happy . unless i 'm bored . that blonde woman , is that your wife ?	what about her ?
nothing ... tell me , what do you want out of life ?	where do you get these questions ?
just answer .	i do n't know , make some money , have some kids , you know .
does n't suit you .	how would you know ?
just does n't , that 's all .	well i ought to know my own mind and i 'm tellin ' you what suits me is a family and kids . that suits me right down to the ground . in fact , that 's my idea of heaven . all right , what 's your idea of heaven ?
see ? you 're laughing again . but that 's what i want . go places and move and never look back and just have fun . forever . that 's my idea of heaven . need someone to share it with , though .	you mean behan ? then why are you with him ?
well he 's handsome and he 's charming . he 's all right . for now . do n't say it , i know , i 'm rotten . i ca n't help it . i 've tried to be good but it 's too boring .	the way you talk . never heard a woman talk like that .
oh look , i have n't got time to be proper , i want to live . i 'm a woman , i like men . if that 's unladylike then i guess i 'm not a lady . at least i 'm honest .	well you 're different , no arguing that . but you 're a lady all right . i 'll take my oath on it .
what 's wrong ?	i do n't know , does n't make any sense . i almost ca n't look at you . like it hurts .
you know this is adultery . you burn in hell for that .	then let 's make sure we get our money 's worth
i must say this certainly has been an unexpected little windfall .	fortuitous even .
and i do n't even know your full name .	easy to fix . wyatt berry stapp earp .
and i 'm josephine sarah marcus . my friends call me josie .	josie ... no , i 'm gon na call you sadie .
i hate sadie .	well you 'll always be sadie to me .
always ?	getting late . we better get back .
so i assume we 're regarding this as just a kind of interlude .	look , it 's too much of a tangle . i already cast my lot . i ca n't go back and i ca n't sneak , feel back enough as it is .
you feel bad about this ? about me ?	i did n't mean it that way .
you know you do n't have to sneak . you could stay with me . i know things , wyatt . sweet things . i could make you so happy .	i ca n't , i 'm sorry . forgive me .
no , no , get away , get away from me ...	wyatt ...
sorry about your friend . and i 'm sorry about ...	i forgave you the moment you said it .
i have to go .	wait !
wyatt ! my god ...	did you ever see the sun come up over the rockies ? it hits all of a sudden and below there 's california and you swear you 're looking at heaven .
i have nothing left . i have nothing to give you . i have no pride , no dignity , no money . i do n't even know how we 'll make a living . but i promise i 'll love you every second of your life .	do n't worry , wyatt . my family 's rich .
what can i get you ?	let me have one of those cigars . kinda nice in here . you run it ?
milt joyce , owner-operator .	well , excuse me for askin ' , milt , but is n't it kinda dead in here ?
you see that bird at the faro table ? that 's johnny tyler . he barged in here one day , said he was takin ' over the game , started slappin ' customer , wavin ' his gun around , scarin ' off all the high-class play . only trade comes in here now 's just bummers and drovers , just the dregs .	why do n't you get rid of him and get yourself straight dealer ?
those cowboys 're tellin ' everybody in town they 're gon na clean you out . they 're down in that lot right now behind the ok corral .	do n't worry , doc , it 's not your problem . you do n't have to mix up in this .
wyatt , i could n't find a single store that had laudanum any-	mattie , they 're here ! folks this is celia ann but you can call her mattie . or even mrs. earp if you prefer .
come up to the fire , honey .	i think i 'll just lie down awhile
long as i live i 'll never get used to that sound .	they 're just lonely is all . hell , i howl myself sometimes .
no , stay . please stay with me .	honey , i got ta start makin ' money .
oh , all right .	well i guess i do n't have to go right now . i guess i could stay a little while .

out ridin ' . so ... how you doin ' ?	i do n't know . i 'm all right .
really ? you sure ?	sure i 'm sure . what is this ?
well , i was thinking , we 've already made a pile of money . maybe we should just pull up stakes and move on . and we could stay on the move , you know ? just keep going , see the world . live on room service the rest of our lives . how 'd that be ?	wyatt , what 're you talkin ' about ?
thought you swore you 'd never carry that thing again .	yeah , well , i swore a lot of things .
mattie . what about this ?	i need it .
'least you admit it .	admit what , i 'm an opium fiend ? no , wyatt , i just said i need it . i need something to keep me warm at night .
look , mattie , i know you're-	you know nothing . what you do n't know would fill a book . jesus , i feel like it 's when you 're around i need it most . you 're never yourself , you never relax . never . everything 's so stiff and dead . you always have to keep a rein on everything , ever yourself . oh , you smile sometimes , i 've even seen you laugh . but there 's no light in your smile for me , wyatt , nothing to keep me warm . and i get cold , wyatt . i get so cold . what 's between you and that jew woman ?
all right , look . i can make it right , i can make this up to you , mattie . i can , i swear .	will you go to her and tell her right in front of me she 's nothing to you ? right out loud so i can hear ? tell her she 's nothing , tell her she 's nobody , just dirt ? will you do that ?
well hello , sherm .	you wanted to talk ?
yeah , kinda , wanted to see if you 'd join back up with us .	that what you got me up here for ?
you 're a cowboy , you 're a brother . come back , no hard feelings .	forget it , ringo .
is n't there anything i can say that 'll change your mind ? you 're gon na stay with your new friends ?	'least they do n't scare women .
run for your lives , boys ! it 's that great two-gun dog-catcher from kansas !	mcmasters , is n't it ? listen , you seen a black stallion with-
look , i got a rule . i do n't talk to lawmen . dog-catchers neither .	i 'm not a lawman , i 'm just a private citizen getting ' my property back
so what about you cowboys anyway ?	if i had to explain it you would n't understand . just say we 're brothers to the bone .
yeah , but some of the things they say your brothers 've done ...	there 's all kinds of horses , ai n't there ? same with cowboys . what they do 's their affair . i do n't preach and i do n't judge . i ai n't no dog-catcher .
no , wait . please . i know nothin ' i say 'll fix things but i want you to know it was n't me .	no ? brothers to the bone , right ?
i ai n't your brother , i ai n't none of your damn brothers . move !	all right , run 'em off .
florentino ! he 's getting away !	drop his horse .
i know that cut . you mean there 's a waterhole near there ?	but this time they 'll be ready .
what 'd you do that for ?	so he can tell the story .
next waterhole 's black draw . we could be there by mid-morning .	they 're wise by now . which is next , iron springs ? yeah , let 's try there , iron springs .
there they are . no herd though .	we 'll go around that way , come up on foot .
i do n't like it .	might as well hear him out . anyways , what choice we got ? but no matter what happens , see it through to the end . if you do n't i 'll curse the day i ever laid eyes on you .
well how do we look ?	hey ! virgil ! my god ! morgan ! hey , boy ! you look great ! both of you !
give him some good exercise ? sure some stud . some string in fact . what 're you gon na do , race 'em ?	hope so . clean up with this boy .
boy , look at all those stars . bet you can see every star there is . practical touch 'em . kinda makes you think , you know ? i mean you look up and you think god made all that but he still remembered to make a little speck like me . kinda flattering really . hey , wyatt , you believe in god ? no , come on , really , do you ?	maybe , yeah . hell , i do n't know .
well what do you think happens when you die ?	got me . somethin ' . nothin ' . i do n't know .
really ? what about hell ? they got a sign or what ?	hey , wyatt , god damn it , i 'm serious !
wyatt , meet fred white , he 's town marshal .	lotta law around here . just met the sheriff .
it 's that woman from the coach !	i 'll be damned ...
hey doc ! come on now .	just his style , morg . does n't mean anything .
listen to me , both of you . this is no good . this is trouble we do n't need . for the first time in our lives we got a chance to stop wandering and finally be a family . do this and you throw it all away . you saw what happened to fred white .	come on , we 're not about pickin ' fights . just gon na keep a little order , that 's all .
yeah ?	like you said , just got ta know how to handle 'em . old fred was n't up to it . we know that we 're doin ' , wyatt .
all right , say you 're right , say you do n't get yourself killed . there 's something else . it 's too late for virge , he already rolled his bone . but it 's not too late for you , morg .	what 're you talkin ' about ?
doc wo n't quit , been up 36 hours . clanton came in an hour ago , they switched over to poker . tried to get him to bed but he just wo n't let go .	i know . and nobody can make him .
how you doin ' , boy ?	fine . better .
you were right . it 's nothin ' like i thought . i almost wish ...	i know , kid . i know . me too .
dropped him , that was it . sorry if i made a worse mess for you .	i 'm the one made a mess . made a right fair mess of the whole thing .
that thunder 's sure somethin ' .	that did n't sound like thunder .
get down , boy .	morgan , are you crazy ? they 're out gunning for us ! what the hell 're you doin ' ?
what 's it look like ? they want a piece of me they can come and get it , i 'm not crawlin ' into my hole .	morg , use your head .
i am usin ' it , wyatt . been wonderin ' how the hell we got in this tangle . you know they hit clum 's house , too ? shot up his wife . his wife . who ever heard of that ? men sneakin ' around in the dark , back-shootin ' , scarin ' women ? they 're bugs , wyatt . you know all your smart talk about live and let live ? ai n't no live and let live with bugs .	i know , i was wrong . but morg , look , we got to get out .
i just got it fixed .	you 're on .
you were right , wyatt . they got me good . do n't let 'em get you too .	will somebody get the damn dog out-
remember about the light you 're supposed to see when you 're dyin ' ?	easy morg , do n't think about that now .
you back that queen again , you son of a bitch , i 'll blow you right out of that chair ! somethin ' on your mind ?	just wanted to let you know you 're sitting in my chair .
that a fact ?	yeah . it 's a fact .
for a man that do n't go heeled you run your mouth kinda reckless .	do n't need to go heeled to get the bulge on a dub like you .
that a fact ?	yeah . it 's a fact .
go ahead . skin it . skin that smoke wagon and see what happens .	listen mister , i 'm getting ' tired-
easy , gents . private affair ... wyatt ! doc ! hey !	jack ...
way ahead of you , wyatt . you want us to help you get ike clanton and johnny behan . everybody knows they 're the ones to blame for your brothers .	they 're nothing . they 're nobody . i want the cowboys . all of 'em . i mean to break 'em up , drive 'em out of the territory .
got a sheaf of federal warrants . being in the territories it 's up to our discretion how they 're served . that means we got the cowboys without quarter . the black flag , brother . no prisoners , no mercy , amen .	500 ... year 's wages . and i never even saw a horse like that .
talked it over . we decided we do n't need the money . took out 13 dollars each , though . federal posseman 's fee . that all right ?	sure ...
we should get moving .	doc 's just in no kinda shape .
allie-girl ... and louisa ! you 're so lovely . i 'm at your feet , darlin ' . just at your feet . guess it 's only right . ma always said you were the prettiest .	but she doted on the frowner
look at that . busted . brand new money ward , too . 33 years old and i do n't even have a decent watch . 'bout time i started lookin ' out for myself .	well here we are a family again . been so long plain forgot how good it feels . want to thank you for that , wyatt . all your doin ' .
well that 's your problem . hey virge , see anything of doc while you were in prescott ?	hit a streak when we left . him and kate .
look pretty rough .	just like any other hard cases . got ta know how to handle 'em .
well we 're off and running . just acquired us a quarter-interest in the game at the oriental .	acquired ?
her maiden name was sullivan .	better go with 'em , honey . here 's where i leave you .
keep your eye on that brass ring . do n't let anything side-track you .	i know , i need a keeper .
you know , i was thinkin ' , maybe we ought to open our own place . that 's the real money . build it up , milk it for all it 's worth , then sell it off for a bundle and breeze out of this burg with more money than croesus and ready to live like kings . let 's you and me take a walk around town , virge , see if we can scout us out a couple of nice lots .	i ca n't hardly believe it . it 's working out just like you said , wyatt . we 're lootin ' this burg six ways through sunday .
pretty fun too , is n't it ?	kinda , actually , yeah . i got ta admit .
i could n't help it , wyatt . i looked at that woman and it was just like somebody slapping me in the face . i mean these people 're afraid to even walk down the street and i 'm trying to make money off it like some kind of god damn vulture . that 's not me , that 's somebody i do n't even know .	virgil , please . do n't do this to me .
it 's got nothin ' to do with you , wyatt . it's-	nothing to do with me ? i 'm your brother for christ 's sake . god , i do n't believe this . talk to him , will you ? or hit him . oh no , do n't tell me ...
maybe i jumped the gun . maybe those cowboys are n't near as bad as they 're painted . you know i was thinkin ' , there 's a lot of money in the cattle business ...	wait a minute , you thinkin ' of getting in bed with the cowboys ?
business is business . do n't have to love 'em to work with 'em . not if there 's money in it .	you are the one , wyatt . you sure are .
billy clanton , wes fuller , and billy claiborne . now there 's six of 'em . this is like a bad dream .	just stay calm , use your head . it 'll be all right . just the same , though ... guess you better swear me in .
here they are again . look at 'em .	easy , virge , they 're just tryin ' to egg us on .
wait till the liquor wears off . once they start getting headaches they 'll lose interest .	wyatt , they 're threatening our lives .
you 'll never make that stick .	they 're carrying guns in town .
virge , that 's a misdemeanor . you go down there to arrest 'em , something goes wrong , maybe this time somebody gets his head broke , suddenly it 's a mess and it wo n't end there , you 'll have cowboys comin ' around lookin ' for trouble from here to christmas . you gon na risk all that over a misdemeanor ?	no , damn it , it 's wrong , they 're breakin ' the law .
virge , you 're makin ' the arrest . you make contact , i 'll back you up . morgan 'll back me up , doc 'll keep an eye out for trouble . and keep your hands on your guns . they even look like they 're gon na start something , buffalo 'em . right over the head .	wyatt , i know what i 'm doin ' .
getting late . guess i 'll turn in .	bundle up , virge . cold out there .
virgil ?	wyatt ...
what about all these saloons ?	ah , now that 's the real mother- lode in tombstone . up and down allen street , full-blast 24 hours a day , liquor , hostesses , gamblin ' , makin ' money hand over fist . all except the oriental . on account of the element . have a man for breakfast in there most days . regular slaughter house . high-rollers wo n't go near it . too bad , nice place .
see what i mean about it getting spooky ?	curly bill , huh ? who was that other idiot ?
ike clanton , old man 's eldest son . know he ai n't got the stuff , makes him miserable .	yeah , and dangerous .
why do n't you just leave it alone ?	no , i got ta do something . i do n't suppose you 'd card-
... what were you saying , admiral ? something about this 'not being a job for a wine-sniffing , skirt-chasing playboy spy ? '	- i 'll be sure to acknowledge 007 's 'assistance ' in my report to the prime minister . but this is , still , a naval operation .
but -	- thank you , m. but this is more than your man can handle . are we in agreement ?
i appreciate your assistance , m. but this is now a military operation .	bring up the tracking satellite . and get 007 out of there .
it 's too late -	get bond out of there .
good evening . i 've just spoken with the prime minister at the economic summit in tokyo ; he 's expecting a full update within the hour . for those of you still unaware , some forty minutes ago -	excuse me , but - i must formally protest this meeting . given the nature of what 's occurred - and the need for secrecy - i see no reason to involve the air force , the army , or mi-6 . this is an internal affair that should be handled strictly by the officers of her majesty 's royal navy .
why was n't the ship protected ? ! ? ! why was it sailing without radar ?	i resent your tone , sir . i have men who are missing -
at least we know where the gold is . when are the recovery ships due ?	36 hours . they 've already sailed from the persian gulf .
always nice to meet one of her majesty 's fellow subjects ... especially one with such distinguished friends .	you might say i 've always been one of mr. valentin 's biggest followers .
it 's a beautiful boat , sir elliot . practically glows in the dark .	i can tell you 're a man with an eye for exquisite possessions , mr. bond . darling ! come here . i want you to meet my wife .
i hope you 've enjoyed this little charade .	which part ? the colonel 's ? or yours ?
a piece of advice , mr. bond : do n't screw with a man who buys ink by the ton . it 's deadlier than uranium .	we 'll see about that .
how did you get this number ?	oh , please , mr. bond . we live in the information age ! information is currency - and with the right currency , you can have any piece of information . besides i own the phone company . what do you say ? twenty minutes ?
mr. bond ! nice to see you .	sir elliot .
before i became involved with paris , she was always involved with the most inappropriate ' men ... playboys . thrill seekers . middle aged peter pans who only brought out the worst in her .	i see .
i tried to save her . but she remained a manic depressive : fits , inappropriate behavior ... delusions of grandeur .	i wonder if it runs in the family .
still , i do miss her . i only wish she could have lived to see all this .	i can feel your pain .
by the way - what is it that brings you to kuala lumpur , mister bond ?	sightseeing .
i call this the rogue 's gallery .	yes . i can see : you 've hung the rest of your relatives .
my third great uncle - the earl of aberdeen - negotiated the purchase of hong kong from the chinese . his son-in-law - george harmsway - made the first family fortune , running opium into shanghai ... his son , thomas , who lost it , smoking the opium ... and my grandfather henry , who opened the first telegraph station , and published the colony 's first english newspaper . it was a city of unlimited possibility .	so why did you leave ?
welcome to the new world order , mr. bond . churchill had his armies ; caesar had his legions ; i have my divisions : news , sports , business , entertainment . and these are my foot soldiers : 2000 people working on 14 floors to feed 300 newspapers , 4 cable news networks , 87 magazines , and 29 different cable tv channels - in 35 languages .	and still not a thing to watch .
... although it must be fun to have all those satellites .	they 're merely tools to disseminate information .
or disinformation ... if you wanted to , say , beam down a signal to send a ship off course ? maybe one degree a minute ?	fantastic idea mr. bond ! perhaps i should buy it for a book ! it 's totally preposterous , but - you amuse me . ... and now perhaps i can amuse you .
you see , mr. bond , you and i are both men of action . but your era is passing . words are the new weapons ; satellites the new artillery . and make no mistake about it : in the right hands , they can be as deadly as your walther ppk .	... words to live by ?
briefly .	do n't pout , sidney . i invited him here hoping he might shed some light on your story . he 's from 'lloyd 's of london . ' ... are n't you , mr. bond ?
... and what 's that , my dear ?	sidney , perhaps we should leave this to -
i 'm sure they will .	good-bye , mister bond .
are your guards really going to kill a helpless girl ?	my guards are from south africa , mr. bond . this is their chance to get even with the formerly 'great ' britain . now both of you . put your hands on your heads , and step forward .
... so that 's what the weapons grade uranium was for .	precisely , mr. bond . in a matter of minutes , the boring device will arrive at the core of the reactor ... and when the radioactive blades cut into the plutonium -
- instant melt-down .	chernobyl will look like a campfire .
... as the advertising says : tomorrow never lies .	what about the gold ?
i 'd rather die alone .	take the girl . leave the handcuffs . we 'll drown her at sea .
in the strait of malacca , when a boat is even five minutes late , one begins to worry , mr. bond .	i know . pirates from sumatra want the cargo ; smugglers from thailand and burma want the ships .
sometimes kill the crew ; other times - torture them .	i 'm sorry .
the kuala lumpur ferry was 35 miles off-course that night . captain blamed the auto-pilot ; i suspected he was drunk - until the sumatra ferry captain had same problem .	did you test the auto-pilots ? the satellite positioning receiver ?
next morning . both boats . nothing wrong . my 90 year old grandfather thinks 'ghost in the computer - silicon dragon . '	i appreciate your time -
maybe you should talk to sidney winch . owns a marine salvage company . nobody knows more about the strait .	where can i find him ?
i 'm sure she is , james . but i 'm afraid you 'll have to 'kiss off ' the rest of your lessons this afternoon .	moneypenny ... here i was , finally getting a feel for a new tongue -
4:30. it may take me a little longer to wrap things up here .	four o'clock . do n't be late .
tsi tien , chien-penny .	ah , james . you always were a cunning linguist ... au revoir , mon cher .
moneypenny ! we 've got to stop meeting like this . they may be on to us .	hello , james . enjoy your meeting ?
by the way , james : ordinarily i would never ask , but ... were n't you and that colonel once stranded on a raft for two weeks in the sargasso sea ?	moneypenny ! how indiscreet ! have you ever known me to kiss and tell ?
actually , i 've never known you to do either ... but -	- we all want what we ca n't have ?
what - no lust for adventure ?	no , 007. it 's just that i 've learned from personal experience - that when we get what we want - somehow the reality is never as ... satisfying as the fantasy .
q ! how are you ?	retired . i 'm not getting paid to help you save the world anymore .
i 'm sorry . it was a national emergency -	that hardly makes up for the imposition . now , for what i hope will be the very last time - pay attention , 007. first , computer generated retrograde analysis map . body here , meteorolog- ical influences here , likely vector- ing of the ship 's coordinates here .
do you have any idea of what any of that means ? in english ?	not a clue . i did n't lose the ship . next , your new personal communicator . picture-phone , fax , beeper .
do i have to dial '9 ' to get out ?	i do n't care who you dial , so long as it 's not me . next -
your new car .	- four wheel drive ?
yes . and do try to keep all four of them on the road . all the usual refinements : smoke , missiles , machine guns - fully operational remote control . drives forward , reverse - stop that ! plus infrared thermal imaging radar , heads up instrumentation , and 17 beverage cup holders .	... 17 beverage cup holders ?
i must say , q , you seem to be doing rather well in your retirement .	do n't even think about it . 007. they 're my granddaughters .
yes -	guard ! arrest these men ! escort them to the cutter !
wait a minute -	get them out of here . if he says one word , shoot him .
do n't you think you 're overreacting ?	yes . the famous james bond . i 've heard all about you , sir . you were under direct orders to act as an observer - and yet you had to go off , on your own , like some half-assed cia cowboy - endangering the gold , attracting that lunatic woman , and then putting in a distress call for us to save your bloody hide .
... that 's all well and good , captain , save for one thing : there 's no gold down there .	what are you talking about ? we went through all this and the ship is n't even down there ?
yes , the ship is down there . but the gold is gone .	that 's absurd ! it took two squads of forty men fifteen days to load that gold .
paris ? ! ? what are you doing here ?	is that any way to say hello ?
oh , james . i 've missed you -	is this another one of your games ?
stop it ! you 're hurting me ! ca n't you just be nice ?	i 've got half the british government breathing down my neck . i do n't have time for your nonsense .
do n't you even miss me ? did n't i mean anything to you ?	nothing .
what about elliot harmsway ? or is this just another one of your stunts ?	no ! he 's crazy - he 's insane . he hates everybody . he 's got these plans - you 've got to help me , james . i 'm sorry . i 'm sorry for everything . i know i was wrong - but you 've got to protect me . i know you still love -
do you feel better now ?	do you ?
what about the uranium ?	it 's on the boat . he 's holding a press conference tomorrow .
i 'm so sorry , james . i promise , i 'll never leave you again .	shhhhh ...
paris -	leave me alone ! he 's going to kill me ! !
why did n't you tell me ? why was n't it in our files ?	he did n't want anyone to know . he kept it out of the papers . he said a third wife was bad for his image . you 've got to protect me !
just - say it . say it just once .	one thing at a time . i 'll see you in twenty minutes . go .
his newspapers ?	occasionally , yes . british media mogul . born in hong kong ; controls newspapers , tv , radio , cable , satellites ; books , magazines , movies , computer software . theme parks .
more scurrilous , unsubstantiated gossip .	perhaps . but it does explain how an ex-kgb agent turned illegal-arms dealer is suddenly portrayed as a long-time friend of the people . if you believe what you read in the papers .
there is one last thing , 007 : elliot harmsway is vital to the economic interests of this nation . he 's also a major contributor to the party . i expect him to be given every consideration .	political considerations ?
okay , saunders . what is it this time ? rocket in the leg ? machine pistol in the arm ?	q 's retirement party . i 'd just put the knife into the cake , and -
it must do something .	well ... if you insist .
now pay attention , 007. we have n't much time to demonstrate your new q toys .	how is old q ?
gone fishing .	fishing ?
saunders , i 've lit cigarettes -	not from forty feet .
... shoelaces ?	plastique explosive shoelaces . cut them to regulate the size of the blast ; totally harmless until you attach the detonator hidden in the heel of your shoe .
perfect way to tie up a ... 'knotty ' problem ?	moving along - a typical plastic security card . name here , magnetic information stripe here - and a code breaking microprocessor here . swipe it through any card reader - anywhere - you 're in .
it was an authorized test . i returned the money .	i see ...
finally , your new watch : blue laser here for signaling or burning through locks ; press this button , the sweep hand becomes a geiger counter .	if you ca n't do the time , do n't do the crime ?
a wedding band ? ? ? what am i supposed to be able to do with this ?	i believe q 's exact words were : `` hopefully , nothing . ''
wade , what the hell are you doing here ?	i am not here , ol ' buddy . the cia has absolutely no knowledge of the missing ship , the missing gold , where it was going , or when it left hong kong .
that 's reassuring .	hey - the world is my office .
i do n't know if you 'd call it a boat ...	something with an engine ? not oars ?
what do you want with the harbor master ?	tide and current charts . work backward from the body - find where the ship sank . where did you get the boat ?
i think i 've just seen my next future ex-wife .	not if you kill us first - unless that 's how you plan to leave muffy .
natalya ?	yeah . russian minister of transportation .
she married a hockey player .	i envy your 'undercover ' assignments .
i have to get these to london . do you know this captain cheong ?	spends his nights at the kuala lumpur yacht club .
can you arrange a meeting ?	hell . the cia built that club .
yo ! jimbo ! i won five hundred - what happened ?	he tied one on .
i dunno , jimbo . it ca n't be out here . how could they get this far off course ?	who knows ? fog , night ...
they 'd never sail this close to the shore .	wait a minute - i 've got it . there ! off the port bow !
i got you covered .	that 's reassuring .
sidney winch , meet -	jack wade . citibank . commercial loan division . if you 're ever lookin ' for a sweet refinance on the boat -
where to now , jimbo ?	i 'm not certain ... but i think there 's someone i want to press for some answers in kuala lumpur .
interesting presentation .	interesting video tape .
they point , i shoot .	do you have a pen ? i just got promoted and do n't have my new cards yet .
... does this do anything ?	depends what number you write .
married ?	happily .
... kids ?	three . you ? married ?
no .	i did n't think so .
here . i gave you my assistant 's phone number . if it 's urgent , she knows where to reach me .	thanks . take care -
bourbon . neat .	i wonder if you handle your liquor more carefully than you handle your boat .
sometimes , you just have to plunge into things . be reckless .	- and i bet you always leave turmoil in your wake .
have we met ?	this afternoon . our boats practically kissed in the harbor . james bond .
vodka martini , shaken not stirred . and another for you ?	no . but you can buy a drink for my friend , taro .
boyfriend ?	chaperone . i 'm waiting for my dinner date .
pity . bring him whatever he wants .	so what brings you to kuala lumpur , mr. bond ? wait - do n't tell me : unhappy marriage ? running from some poor little girl with two kids and a chanel pocketbook in - london ?
actually , i 'm here on business . you might say it was a ... golden opportunity .	and exactly what business are you in , mr. bond ?
insurance . lloyds of london .	the strait can be a very dangerous place , mr. bond . a few words scribbled on a piece of paper in london does n't carry a lot of value out here . including life insurance .
i 'll keep that in mind .	i see my date is here . and i think mr. bond is ready to leave .
nice to run into you again .	let 's not make it a habit .
- shut up !	you have to excuse miss winch : she thinks she 's on a 'seduce and destroy ' mission through life ... ... but she wo n't kill us .
no ?	no . first , because i do n't think it 's in your nature . and second , because there 's no gold down there .
do i have to do everything around here ?	i hope so .
i hope you 'll be gentle .	think about mom .
and what do you call this ?	- the family jewels ?
if i were you -	- you 're not .
just remember : they think there 's ten billion dollars in gold down there .	thank you . `` now hear this : drop dead . ''
why do n't we just take these -	no . i want sir elliot to keep them .
... do you have a gun ?	what ?
you heard me . a gun ? i left mine in the car .	that 's funny : you struck me as the kind of man who always carries protection .
harmsway sank that ship and stole the gold . it 's on the sea dolphin ii . and thanks to your little show and tell - - giving him the evidence - we 're the only ones who can tie him to the crime .	elliot harmsway is my uncle !
blood or dutch ?	he was my father 's best friend !
he 's killed closer .	you are seriously deranged .
this has got to be a mistake .	the only mistake is that they did n't kill us in the elevator .
wait here .	no . i 'm going with you .
... how did you get into marine salvage ?	my father left me the business .
not a lot of difference .	what do you mean ?
what the hell does that do ?	cleans dirt . let 's go .
down ?	up .
what now ? and do n't give me some movie clich like 'trust me . '	trust me .
put your back to the railing . sit up on it .	are you listening to me ?
put your arms around my neck . lock your legs around my waist .	... we have time for that ?
sometimes you just have to -	do n't say it .
is this - like - a normal day for you ?	it 's a lousy job , but - the only reason i stay is for the health benefits .
here . you shoot . i 'll drive .	... you know , that 's another reason you 're probably not in a successful relationship .
another reason ? ? ? did i miss something ? ? ?	you insist on calling all the shots . and by the way : i am not a helpless girl .
if it 's radio controlled , it 'll break the code .	if not ?
sleep well ?	next time , i do the driving .
what do you mean , you 'd rather die alone ?	i did n't say when i want to die -
... yes ? ? ?	before we go any further here , mr. bond , from lloyds of london , i just want to get two things straight .
... yes ?	first , that boat is in international waters . i 'm claiming it for salvage . one-third of that gold is mine .
and number two ?	if you think we 're going to have some kind of 'life affirming ' romance here just because we cheated death , let me be clear : we 're going to have it where i want , and when i want .
and when might that be ?	now .
thank you colonel everhart . 007 , i 'd like to see you in my office . why do n't you and the colonel exchange numbers if you need more information ?	yes , m .
come in , 007. you know the minister ?	of course . minister johnstone .
tell me , 007 , what do you know about elliot harmsway ?	only what i read in the newspapers .
- along with tomorrow - the first world-wide newspaper . circulation 27 million . daily . -	'able to topple governments with a single story ' - as he says in his press .
... what 's harmsway done ?	it seems , 007 , we 've received a tip
the reason i invited the minister here , 007 , was to reassure him that this investigation will be handled with the utmost discretion .	of course .
which is also why i 've withheld this information from nato and our allies .	... did n't we once investigate harmsway ?
you 're to wear this mask at the venice carnival , and wait to be contacted .	i understand .
... . i hate to ask , but ... did you ever think you 'd miss communism ?	we serve the interests of the british people , 007. no matter who we may be foolish enough to elect .
but if elliot harmsway is involved with that uranium , i want him prosecuted to the ends of the earth .	hopefully , it wo n't get that far .
... i 'll give you a ring from venice .	good luck on your mission , 007 .
sorry i 'm late -	actually , you 're just in time . admiral roebuck : you know commander bond , do n't you ?
... you 're turning into quite the politician , 007 .	i have an excellent teacher . 'make sure you wear the uniform ' ?
what do you make of all this ?	it does n't quite add up .
the infrared satellite images . no heat , no flame , no explosion . if that boat went down where they said it did , there should have been some residual heat reading on the surface .	sabotage ?
... and what do you call these ?	ja-shwa tsway . these are lips .
and what do you call these ? the gang of two ?	stop it !
i was just getting to the interesting part !	we 've already done the interesting part . do you forget ?
sakwa !	is that mandarin , or cantonese ?
tsi tien , mr. bond .	tsi tien , professor wu .
who 's in charge here ?	i am . what do you want ?
you have precisely one minute to pull up your anchor and be under way .	forget it . no way . i got here first .
what 's your name ?	captain morton .
my name is sidney winch , and -	good for you , miss winch . you now have exactly 30 seconds to get this rust bucket out of here .
i know my rights . these are international waters . the british navy abandoned that boat , and i 'm claiming it . under international law , i have the right to salvage what 's on that wreck .	fifteen seconds . perhaps you should consider hiring an attorney .
i was an attorney !	hmmm . i suppose this is a step above that profession . ten seconds . are you leaving ?
no .	you leave me no alternative .
you wo n't get away with this !	good-day , miss winch . i advise you to get some steam up - before you run aground .
the canadian prime minister wants to set a lunch -	pencil it in for the next trip -
the american presidential candidate called to complain about that sex story -	send him a $ 10,000 campaign contribution , and explain i have no control over what my journalists write -
your bankers want an answer about the brazilian tv stations	no -
the queen invited you to dinner -	yes -
and the 9:30 news meeting is waiting .	excellent .
damn . it 's doing it again .	what 's wrong ?
the back-up does the same thing .	check it again . what about the global positioning satellite ? could there be something wrong with the signal ?
how is it now ?	seems to be back to normal , sir .
a dead head . water logged timber . floats straight up . you sometimes see them on the east side of the channel - from the logging camps on sumatra - but they do n't usually float this far west . muncy ! engines to half !	aye-aye sir . engines to half .
what is he doing here ?	i see you two have met .
obviously , the british government denies all of this -	- i told you ! he was there ! -
he brought that up from the wreck .	... i see .
... well ! i do believe this requires further investigation !	thank you , uncle elliot .
how sweet .	my timing always was lousy .
that was too close .	do n't worry . mr. bond will get the message . so will his boss .
the drill is in the water ; approaching the intake tunnel .	excellent .
please , sidney . i 'd like to remember you fondly .	approaching the first gate .
bore through . ... they used to say living well was the best revenge , mr. bond . they 're wrong . revenge is the best revenge .	entering the main tunnel - ten minutes to target -
hong kong , mr. bond !	you have to leave -
take the men . i can finish alone .	you come with me - you stay here .
is the helicopter ready ?	fueled and waiting .
it 's a trick ! after him . they 're in the south stairwell !	get more men up there !
they 're on the bridge . seal off the 50th floor !	i should have hired this man . get somebody up there !
- built to withstand a nuclear blast . are they alive ?	yes . shall we kill them ?
what the hell is going on ?	it 's bond !
i regret to inform you , sir , that saddam hussein is still demanding a bonus for his role in the gulf war .	... have n't we already paid him for his services ?
... and there 's no truth that 10 % of that money will go into your swiss bank account ?	no sir ! i swear ! this is not true ! !
please sir . please -	... but because i am a just man , i 've decided to give mr. hussein what he deserves .
mr. stamper will escort you to the plane .	thank you sir ! thank you !
what about id 's ?	one to seven : deal the face cards .
oh , no .	who is it ?
kim dae yung . north korean nuclear specialist .	meaning there may be nuclear material down there ?
who is that ? ! ? what 's in the box ? ?	i do n't know . he 's not in the database -
will it go off ?	maybe . maybe not .
soviet sb-9 nuclear torpedo . yield , one kiloton .	will the cruise set it off ?
what time is it ? do you think you can just treat us like your slave ? it 's after one .	i tried to call to let you know i was going to be late .
i pay my own way .	since when ?
your mother asked me not to mention it but your mother 's birthday was last week .	i had n't forgotten . i ordered some cloth but it did n't come in and i felt so bad if i would have come to her birthday without that , i just stayed at home .
what did your wife get her ?	we got the same thing .
why , you do n't want us to bring him over ?	no , it 's that when do you have time to be parents to him ? you guys do n't pick him up until nine , ten at night . you are into yourselves , as the saying goes . spend some time trying to be parents . take him to the mountains , fishing . you ought to let him get to know nature .
well , you are his grandfather . he is supposed to spend some time with you . you 're supposed to show him those woodsy things and this and that .	junior spends time with his child .
babe brother , is that my shirt that you 're wearing ?	yes .
how come you 're not wearing my shoes ?	they 're too big .
when are you boys going to fix that roof ?	soon as i rest a bit . i meant as soon as we are back to normal again , anytime .
when are you going to find time to help me fix the roof ?	you all do n't believe me when i tell you i 'm afraid of heights .
you used that excuse to get out of the army .	you always got something to say .
you want me to mortgage my house to invest in a scheme of yours ? you know the last time we went into something together daddy had to go in his savings to keep us from ending on the street .	why are you always afraid to get somewhere ?
this is not a good time to take chances . your best friend , robert , an accountant , lost his home and is out on the street . we see him from time to time . he comes down to church for a free meal .	this is what it is all about , trying to keep from being out on the street .
robert asks about you . when are you going to do something to help him ?	maybe i can get down there next week .
why in the hell did n't you help mama ?	i told her i would if she would give me time .
i bet you if your master would have told you to fix the hole in the roof , you would have rebuilt the whole damn house .	you always got the best of it around here and when dad always talks about my son , it is always you , so you fix the roof .
that is a damn lie and you know it . every time father asks you to do something , you either half-ass do it or run off and hide . mama asked you to turn the dirt in her garden and you told her , with your smart ass self , that you were n't a farmer ; get junior to do it . every time someone asks you to do something , you always say , tell junior to do it . boy , you ought to grow up .	i told you about calling me boy . i ai n't no boy . see , you and dad got a bad habit of calling me boy . you call me boy in front of my wife . you think i 'm going to fix the roof ? i hope the wind blows the whole damn thing off and it pours down rain .
i 'm leaving and do n't even call me when the shoe falls 'cause all he did for me was to try and run my life . i 'm tired of people saying babe brother this , babe brother that . what 's my name ?	you dumb ass , it 's babe brother .
i 'll drive her to the hospital .	we will take her . you all stay here and watch dad .
i 'm cold . i need to get out into the sunlight .	what is it , noontime ?
because you were spoiled , do n't try to spoil sunny .	my daddy never gave me anything without my having to sweat for it . every summer , the way they kept me and junior out of trouble was to send us to big daddy 's farm . we would get up with the chickens . every summer the fence had to be repaired . the barn needed a coat of paint . we had to pip all of big mama 's hundred laying hens and go to church all day on sunday . for big daddy , calluses and sweat were the mark of a man . sunny will never have to bust his knuckles like we did .
i want sunny to have an advantage that you and i never had , but he needs discipline , and you are not helping when i tell him to do something and you allow him to get out of it .	what is a sip of coffee going to do ?
coffee is bad for anybody , especially for a child .	i do n't see you crying about my drinking it .
why do n't you come in for a while ?	i would like to finish reading this . what would i talk about ? i have n't read this month 's almanac . i do n't care to hear about how the corn was this fall or how to get rid of gophers by putting garlic in their holes . they pride themselves in making life hard and that 's not my cup of tea .
you would think people never lived in a house if they have to ask what does 1 1/2 baths mean .	will you still get the money from your father ?
i told him we might not need it , if you can talk your parents into giving you your share of the property .	pops put big daddy 's farm in rhonda 's and sunny 's name and fixed it so no one can borrow on it .
we could borrow on that land and put the money to work .	i preached to mom and dad about it but they are stuck in their ways , it 's like talking to a brick . but if there is a way ...
why does he always pick on me ?	he is just being like all parents , concerned about the ones they love .
linda , how come you do n't see that sunny puts his shoes on right ?	why in the h ...
you okay ?	i 'm okay . go back to your friends .
i have more sense than to give up everything , my family , you and sunny . it was n't me , i mean the real me inside my body . i 'm glad it 's over . it 's like a veil has been lifted .	like a veil has been lifted ?
it 's like i 've been swimming in muddy waters .	like muddy waters ?
it was like all those things old country people try to tell you what hell is like .	you were in hell ?
i could n't believe the things i was doing . it was like an internal struggle going on inside my body .	do you think you won ?
it was nip and tuck .	and what lesson have we learned from all of this , babe br ... sam ... i mean samuel ?
who is it ?	babe brother .
i was hoping you came to the door instead of him . it gets cold at night .	this does n't make any sense ; you are going to drag that poor boy out in the cold air .
does n't he look a whole of lot better ?	well , you look better than you did yesterday .
i need to get my suitcase out of the garage .	what for ?
i 'm going back home with harry .	i 've heard some foolish things in my life .
harry is coming to pick me up .	have you lost your mind ? have you thought about your wife and child , not to mention your sick father ? and i need your help to move his bed from under the leak in the ceiling .
i 'm busy .	do n't make me raise my hand to you . you have to see for yourself that you are going in the wrong direction .
ca n't i be myself without you jumping in with your right and wrong ? the world is not black and white . show me one perfect person . if you ca n't , do n't ask me to be .	i do have a right to ask you to be a little bit better than me and your father because we gave you a better head start . you have no right to complain to us about your not having enough . you sit right there with your no manners self .
did you ever have to use this thing ?	that is called a crab apple switch . it 's for those bad acting monkeys and just the thing for a mean dog . now i do n't know if i actually did what i did or got my life and story mixed in with other folk 's stories but i seem to recall that i had to use my crab apple on a boy from back home . i was up in memphis working on the railroad , like your daddy who had an easy job . he would sing a song that had a cadence and we would lay track . anyway i was coming down beale street and i heard this music coming from a saloon . sure enough it was emory . my daddy taught both of us to play but emory was natural at it . got in a blues band and what not . he and another boy had killed a boy named hocker sometime back and they balled the jack leaving town . emory had lost one eye and had a scar running down his face . bad luck i would say . he got to drinking that corn liquor . we went to his girl 's room and he would n't stop drinking . he started talking about the old days and he went mad . he pulled his knife and i got to mine first . the lights went out .
do n't pick up the cards if you are not in the game . did he die ?	i do n't know what happened to him . he just ran out into the streets . i got some old records i want you to hear . i like the blues sung simply , man and a guitar . or sung by a woman who had bad luck all her life . do n't ever let anyone tell you his life 's story if it is of a weary life full of sadness . when i was a boy , a man told me a story of how he lost all of his sons and i 'll be damned if the same thing did n't happen to me .
what is that ?	boy , that is the real south . that is real corn liquor .
never play with someone 's else 's cards . you always get a new deck . look at this card . see anything ?	it is just a regular card .
son , would you do me a favor and see if you could turn off that tap in the bathroom . my hand is too weak . and would you do me another favor ? i do n't like asking this but would you clean the tub for me ? i have trouble bending over .	anytime you need someone to do something for you , just let me know .
i could swear i heard my son call me .	you probably heard the wind stirring up those dead leaves over there .
i do n't want to wear out welcome , but you can stay in someone 's heart longer than you can stay in their house . come with us , boy . we are going to have a good time .	this would be a bad time for me to leave .
you know it is against the city ordinance to keep chickens or live stock .	i always had chickens , ducks and whatnots .
not anymore , not in the city .	we grow most of our own food . the money i get from social security , my pension and my wife 's work , keeps us living on the edge . what choice do people like us have .
well , you just have to move further out .	now how far would further out be ?
my mind plays tricks on me . is it okay if i take a bath now ?	everyone is gone . rhonda is in the bathroom .
babe brother and his wife are taking advantage of a situation . i hate to be mean to people but picking sunny up when they feel like it has to come to an end . now i 'm going to ask him how come he could n't be at your birthday .	do n't bother the poor boy . it just takes some people a little longer to figure out who they are .
let us settle this tomorrow .	look ! do n't try to get ahead by riding our backs .
your feet are cold .	go back to sleep .
i asked you to wake me when babe brother comes .	you all act like two roosters .
i 'm not going to let him get away with murder .	you and babe brother are so much alike ...
he ai n't nothing like me . how come a man has to have sons that are day and night apart ? you ought to stop protecting him .	hush .
you 're always taking his side .	hush .
i 'm trying to make him a man but you keep babying him .	you 're going to find yourself on the floor .
you know , babe brother 's wife just dumps greens in the pot without washing them .	babe brother is a poor boy .
well , it 's up to suzie .	it would be nice .
do you want your coat ? it 's cold out here .	no , i 'm too hot now .
you better be careful . you 'll get a stroke arguing .	i would n't care if i drop dead if he learn something from it . son , you make me wish i was dead .
let us go back in before the night of celebration becomes a night of me killing my son .	no . before anyone moves , you two shake hands and do n't carry it any further .
i 'm worn out .	just stay in bed and rest .
i have to feed the chickens before they wake everybody up .	you stay inside . i will see to them .
it 's good to be able to hear that .	you must have been really sick .
how is the garden doing ?	i need to get out there and get those weeds out .
what , are you having another party ?	you better come sit down . you are still sick .
since this morning .	what happened to your hand ?
what did you put on it ?	it 's healing now .
he 's going to check out heaven first . he gets a round trip ticket to heaven . he gets in heaven and finds it just like back home . people dripping with sweat , working in the fields , hardly surviving . he asked a man who was getting a drink of water , `` i thought the streets were paved with gold . '' `` they are but you wo n't see them , '' he said . `` boy , you got to work day and night cause idleness is sinfulness . '' so he takes the other half of his ticket and takes the express to hell . he sees people stretched out on their backs kicking back , picking their teeth . `` man , this is a dream . '' he asked , `` what 's you 'll doing ? '' they all hollered back , `` sinning . '' the devil was shaking hands with everyone and came up to him and said , `` please to meet you . '' he asked , `` i thought you 'll was supposed to be burning in fire . '' someone said , `` man , ai n't no fire down here except under that pot of chitlins . '' the man was going go ask the preacher back on earth ...	i do n't want to hear any joke about colored people being in hell . you 're being irreverent .
i 'm almost finished . i 'm about to come to the punch line .	i do n't want to hear any tales about colored people ...
but these are white people , anybody . the punch ...	i do n't care to hear any jokes about people being in hell . this cut on my hand reminds me that it is nothing to laugh at .
this is my grandson , sunny . he is my youngest son 's child .	he kind of favors one of my boys when he was about his age .
boy , that is bad luck to touch a fellow with a broom .	he knows better . sunny , apologize to harry .
i came all the way from detroit by bus going to oakland . the bus stopped in los angeles . i had to get off and take a rest . i 'll catch the last bus leaving at midnight . i 'm just too tired to go on .	why did n't you catch a plane ?
my feet have never been on anything that was n't directly attached to the ground .	stay until you feel better ? i would like to hear all the news .
man , put your boxes down and stay as long as you like . we have empty rooms since the boys got their own families and moved out .	well if you 're sure , i wo n't be a bother . oh , i do n't sleep on no spring mattress . i always make myself a pallet on the floor .
man , act like this is your home .	that 's awful generous of you . i always ask to keep from wearing out welcome .
it 's the boy next door throwing at his birds . i 'm just waiting on him to hit a pane in the window	i 'm going to wash up now . you all please excuse me .
good morning .	you ought to come hear our preacher . remember old cat iron ? well , our preacher is just as strong .
next time when i feel a little better perhaps .	i was going to get up and get a hen out there for dinner , but time got away .
oh , i would feel much at home if you let me get one for you . i have n't wrung a chicken 's neck in a month of sundays . you know , folks would call my daddy to kill their hogs . that used to be my trade from time to time .	well , i would appreciate that .
how often is your wife called to help delivery ?	it was slow . now it seems like everyone is having births at home .
what could have caused this ? i just changed this damn thing .	everything these days is made overseas .
you and babe brother hit it off so well .	course , it is your business , but i feel obliged to tell you that maybe you have not been fair with the boy .
i tried to teach him right from wrong just like i did his junior .	everyone has to follow his own plough . a man does n't have to know how to cut a wick and clean a chimney nowadays . city people do n't give a hoot and a holler about the shape of the moon nowadays . you do n't plant old ways ... ... but , at the end , you find yourself doing what your father did but you have to have the land in you . it 's when you want to give the house or farm to the kids and they do n't want it . you sell it to a stranger . you worked your whole life , for what ? i doubt if people nowadays have knowledge of a victory garden or seen an inch worm . all what we 've experienced has no meaning .
you 're suppose to teach your children what you know . junior , i do n't have to worry about . babe brother is a different story .	you still call him boy . you call babe brother boy in front of his wife and son .
my daddy called me boy up to the time he died . i was always boy to him .	'course , you could be right . your sons are alive . all my sons are dead .
have n't the years been good to hattie ?	it has n't been the years ; it 's been the men in her life .
boy , i thought you were about to cross the river .	i tell you , i feel like a ghost .
stranger my foot , it was my grandmother who helped you into this world .	well , i do n't want to put you out .
good evening . it must be all the different time zones i crossed that makes me feel this weary .	you should go back and rest .
one can tell you are from back home . these people nowadays do n't know what manners are .	where we come from , you had to know how to act right . you had to know how to say yes sir and no sir . you had to know your place .
those days you could always find something redeeming about even the worst person .	you remember that boy who lost his mind , joe ? you could hear him pitching horseshoes at night in the dark . he would n't miss a one . make him mad and call yourself running in the house to be safe . he would pick up a brick and say `` go on in there brick and hit somebody '' and it would find its mark .
i was afraid to go to marcus bottom because of him .	all those places that us coloreds lived , that we used to call bottoms , have all been changed to drives and heights . everything is in what you call it , not in what it is .
i have someone i want you to meet .	i 'll be right there .
harry , you know everything .	you got to know everything , do everything , and be everything .
what 's the problem here ?	she has a fish bone caught in her throat . could all of you go in the other room ? gideon , get some bread and toast it quickly and find me the cod liver oil .
how is everybody ?	tolerable well .
ah , you young folks do n't know how it is . how is gideon today ?	he was n't able to get out of bed today .
i hope that it 's nothing serious .	he has never gotten rid of the malaria . he is usually up and at it the next day . i 'm going to make him fresh chicken broth .
can you watch gideon for a while ? one of the girls is going into labor . junior is going to drive me over .	you just run along . i 'll fix him his soup . he will be all right .
that smells like fresh coffee .	let me get you a cup ?
how is he doing ?	as long as he keeps his throat clear , he is able to get some rest .
good afternoon , ladies .	good afternoon to you .
as god is my witness , i have never done anything to that woman .	you must have done something to her .
since she has repented , all she does is throw stones .	hattie is a different person now .
i do n't make no bones about where i 'm going to spend eternity . i have always been wild and you know that . if you are made to feel half a man , what do you think the other half is ?	i 'm glad you brought that up as to who you are . i have to know who is in my house .
you invited me .	only if you are a good man , a friend . are you a friend ?
there is something that i always wanted to know . tell me , how did those boys die ?	now who are we talking about ?
miss clara 's boy , emory , to start with . the johnson 's hocker was another one ...	was n't hocker lynched ?
you know as well as i do that it was made to look like he was lynched . now who would hang someone from a persimmon tree ?	what difference does it make if it 's persimmon , oak tree or huckleberry bush ?
hocker 's death almost caused a race riot . a lot of innocent people could have been hurt behind that .	strange as it may seem , it might have cleared the waters . sometimes the right action comes from the wrong reason .
i think if anybody had a hand in killing hocker , you ought to ask or you should have asked emory and chick .	chick was outright killed by a mob . he killed a white man that owed him some money and when they caught up with him , they tied him behind a car and dragged him from out of the hills back to town .
those boys never did have good luck .	you damn right they did n't , especially emory , my cousin .
a woman in family way just reminds of spring and my younger days .	that 's nice .
how many people do you all feed ?	last saturday we handed out over two hundred meals .
good god almighty , bless your bones . but the problem grows .	week by week the crowds at the door keeps getting larger . we ca n't feed all the hungry .
i do n't know if we could take one in with rhonda and me at home alone at times .	oh , i was n't pointing my finger at you . hey , you have to think of yourself . a lot of them have all kinds of diseases and will cut your throat while you sleep . there are too many bad people out there .
i could n't believe it when suzie called and said you were staying here . how have you been ?	girl , do you still sing and dance ?
harry , that 's not nice . i 'm in church now .	why run out and close the barn door when the horse is gone ? i remember when you were n't saved . that was way back yonder when the natchez trace was just a dirt road .
some people grow up and change their ways .	i know your mother ai n't still operating that house of hers .
none of your business .	that is a boy from home , lulla 's brother .
you know the saying , `` your heart is in your left hand . ''	now i was trying to be nice , to make conversation , since we go back some .
i was quoting from the bible . if the shoe fits , wear it .	`` out of weariness , i spoke to my own heart ; to leave it all and to die . and i gave my heart to know madness and folly . ''
an empty wagon makes a lot of noise and you , tappy head , you ai n't worth the salt you put in greens .	speaking of tappy heads , we ought to have an old fashion fish fry .
is this your house ?	oh . i 'm sorry . gideon , what do you say ?
in the meantime harry can slaughter us a hog .	i already have , my dear .
i appreciate you lending me a hand . that lazy ass brother of mine was suppose to help me .	well some folks are still waiting for their comeuppance . do n't take me wrong but you ca n't judge people by how you act . you 're a caring person .
he should be caring . that is not too much to ask .	ya , but you ca n't do the shuffle with one leg . you and your wife , in your spare time , work with the less fortunate . now i 'm not talking about you and what you do but some folks that always run to help the victim , deep down are attracted to pain and suffering and love to be near the dying .
all the people working with us are really doing it 'cause they hate to see suffering .	you never know what 's in the heart and just because you can cry does n't make you human .
you do n't act like the rest of gideon 's friends . they believe if you are not hard at work , you are hard at sin .	oh , i 'm more modern in my ways . i do n't believe in sin , though there is good and evil . and evil is a thing you work at .
not you must n't touch . your mama might not like you handling knives .	i think he wants to see your rabbit foot .
i let this rabbit foot do in place of my toby that i lost years ago .	what 's a toby ?
you do n't want to be at crossroads without one . it 's a charm that old people teach you how to make . i had one for a long time that belonged to my grandmother who had it ever since she was a child . in my travels i misplaced it . i have been looking over my shoulder ever since .	i thought you were n't old fashioned .
did you have your child at home ?	no . no . no . no . i had my child at cedars and sinai . and that ai n't no county hospital . you have to have cash or check before you come in the door .
some folks take that natural stuff too far .	junior 's wife kept her afterbirth ' in the refrigerator . that 's why i do not eat over there now .
no , but i might have some indian chief tonic .	i have n't heard anyone mention swamp root since button-up shoes went out .
you know harry lied about how that boy hocker got kilt . and it was harry who saw emory last before they found him hanging over a levee like someone would hang a hog .	i remember harry always trying to help someone . he got lulla 's daughter out of trouble . he was always running to the store for someone who could n't leave the house .
you know okra asked me to marry him the other evening .	rush your mouth , girl . no , he did n't . he can not be that big of a damn fool .
i asked harry about it . he did n't own up to it . he said he did n't know what got into okra .	he 's just raffish . harry put him up to it . before evening sun sets , i would have his belongings back on route 55 , that old fox .
i ca n't accuse him just dry long 80 .	everybody who have been associated with harry end up with pennies over their eyes .
what must i do ?	if it was left up to me , i would poison him .
we ca n't really bring another family in here with us .	why not ? harry says that 's the only way to do good .
when did you talk to harry ?	do n't shout !
he just leeches off your parents . he is a master at wearing out welcome .	harry is the kind of guy you would love to take out in the woods and leave under a rock .
now you do n't have to say anything if you do n't want to .	i want to hear what happened . my brother is a jackass and a damn fool . the both of you have been as scarce as hen 's teeth .
you should n't talk about the boy 's father in front of him . this is family business and we have to pull together .	whether the boy hears it or not , the man is still a jackass . everyone should have some mother wit .
what are you doing ?	counting the gray hairs in your head .
counting the what ? what does that have to do with the price of butter ?	i was just trying to make conversation .
where is skip ?	he is in his pigeon cage .
i 'm sorry he got those birds .	you know the man next door is near death .
how are you ?	tolerably well . i brought you some more rabbit manure for your roses .
i did n't mean for you to pay me for that .	i know you did n't but you have been so thoughtful .
but when your sunflowers come up , i 'll pay you for them .	i planted a row just for you and you do n't owe me anything .
wow ! cool !	whadda ya think ?
can we leave this up 'til we move ?	well , sure , we can leave it up .
yeah !	now go get molly . your friends are going to be here any minute .
come on down , guys . it 's time for games ! we 've got prizes !	oh , yeah !
to infinity and beyond !	oh , all this packing makes me hungry . what would you say to dinner at , uh , oh , pizza planet ?
can i bring some toys ?	you can bring one toy ...
mom ! do you know where buzz is ?	no , i have n't seen him .
andy ! i 'm heading out the door .	but mom , i ca n't find him !
well , honey , just grab some other toy ! now c'mon !	okay ...
i could n't find my buzz . i know i left him right there .	honey , i 'm sure he 's around . you 'll find him .
can i help pump the gas ?	sure ! i 'll even let you drive .
yeah ? !	yeah -- when you 're sixteen .
next stop ...	pizza planet ! yeah ! ! !
mom , have you seen woody ?	where was the last place you left him ?
right here in the van .	oh , i 'm sure he 's there . you 're just not looking hard enough .
i looked everywhere , honey , but all i could find was your hat .	but what if we leave them behind ?
everybody say , `` bye , house . ''	bye , house .
hey ! wow !	what ? what is it ?
woody ! buzz !	oh , great , you found them . where were they ?
here ! in the car !	see ? now , what did i tell you ? right where you left them .
which one can i open first ?	let 's let molly open one .
aach ! -- oh , hi , bo .	i wanted to thank you , woody , for saving my flock .
oh , hey - it was nothing .	whadda ya say i get someone else to watch the sheep tonight ?
you 'd think they 've never seen a new toy before .	well sure , look at him . he 's got more gadgets on him then a swiss army knife .
uh , let what ? i do n't -- uh , what do you mean ? who ?	i know andy 's excited about buzz , but you know , he 'll always have a special place for you .
what are you doing over there ?	it 's a long story , bo . i 'll explain later . here , catch this !
we 're almost there .	rocky ! the ramp !
whoooooah ! oh ! bo ! there 's got ta be a less painful way to get my attention .	merry christmas , sheriff .
say , is n't that mistletoe ?	mm-hmmmmm .
hello-o-o ...	ho-yaaahh ! ! !
yes , it is a mistake , because , you see , the bed , here , is my spot .	i need to repair my turbo boosters . do you people still use fossil fuels , or have you discovered crystalic fusion ?
well , let 's see , we 've got double a 's --	watch yourself ! !
yes . they 're andy 's toys .	alright , everyone . you 're clear to come up .
toy ?	t-o-y . toy .
excuse me , i think the word you 're searching for is space ranger .	the word i 'm searching for i ca n't say because there 's pre-school toys present .
he 's not a space ranger ! he does n't fight evil or shoot lasers or fly --	excuse me .
they are a terillium-carbonic alloy and i can fly .	no , you ca n't .
yes , i can .	you ca n't !
can !	ca n't ! ca n't ! ca n't !
i tell you , i could fly around this room with my eyes closed !	okay then , mr. lightbeer ! prove it .
why , thank you . thank you all . thank you .	that was n't flying ! that was falling with style !
listen , lightsnack , you stay away from andy . he 's mine , and no one is taking him away from me .	what are you talking about ? where 's that bonding strip ? !
and another thing . stop with this spaceman thing . it 's getting on my nerves .	are you saying you want to lodge a complaint with star command ? woody oh okay , so you want to do it the hard way , huh ?
do n't even think about it , cowboy !	oh , yeah , tough guy ? !
you actually think you 're the `` buzz lightyear ? '' oh , all this time i thought it was an act ! hey , guys ! look ! it 's the real buzz lightyear !	you 're mocking me , are n't you ?
oh , no , no , no ... buzz , look ! an alien !	where ?
what 's going on ?	nothing that concerns you spacemen . just us toys .
why is that soldier strapped to an explosive device ?	that 's why . sid .
sure is a hairy fellah .	no ! no , that 's scud , you idiot !
that is sid !	you mean that happy child ?
i could have stopped him .	buzz , i would love to see you try . 'course i 'd love to see you as a crater .
buzz ! ! oh , buzz , buzz lightyear ! ! buzz lightyear , thank goodness ! we 've got trouble !	trouble ? ! where ? !
down there . just down there . a helpless toy ... it 's ... it 's trapped , buzz !	then we 've no time to lose ! !
right ? buddy ?	i just want you to know that even though you tried to terminate me , revenge is not an idea we promote on my planet .
oh . oh , that 's good .	but we 're not on my planet , are we ?
according to my nava-computer , the --	shut up ! just shut up , you idiot ! !
sheriff , this is no time to panic .	this is the perfect time to panic ! i 'm lost , andy is gone , they 're going to move from their house in two days and it 's all your fault ! !
my fault ? ! if you had n't pushed me out of the window in the first place --	oh , yeah ? well , if you had n't shown up in your stupid little cardboard spaceship and taken away everything that was important to me --
do n't talk to me about importance . because of you the security of this entire universe is in jeopardy .	what ? ! ! what are you talking about ? !
buzz ! buzz , come back !	go away .
now you 're sure this spacefreighter will return to its port of origin once it jettisons its food supply ?	uh-huh . and when we get there , we 'll be able to find a way to transport you ... home .
no , no , no , wait , buzz , buzz , let 's get in the back . no one will see us there .	negative . there are no restraining harnesses in the cargo area . we 'll be much safer in the cockpit .
ow ! watch where you 're going !	sorry .
wait a minute ! no buzz ! this way ! there 's a special ship . i just saw it !	you mean it has hyperdrive ?
c'mon , c'mon , that 's it ...	where is it ? i do n't see the --
spaceship .	alright buzz , get ready ...
what 's gotten into you , sheriff ? i was --	you are the one that decided to climb into this --
i 've set my laser from stun to kill .	oh , great , great . yeah , and if anyone attacks us we can blink 'em to death .
i sure hope this is n't permanent .	still no word from star command . we 're not that far from the spaceport --
woody , we do n't know what 's out there !	i 'll tell you what 's -- aaaah !
they 're gon na eat us , buzz ! ! do something ! quick !	shield your eyes !
it 's not working . i recharged it before i left . it should be good for hours --	oh , you idiot ! you 're a toy ! use your karate chop action !

woody , stop it ! !	sorry guys , but dinner 's canceled !
another stunt like that , cowboy -- you 're going to get us killed .	do n't tell me what to do !
what happened to you ?	one minute you 're defending the whole galaxy ... ... and suddenly you find yourself suckin ' down darjeeling with marie antoinette and her little sisters .
i think you 've had enough tea for today . let 's get you out of here , buzz .	do n't you get it ? ! you see the hat ? i am mrs . nesbit ! !
oh , i 'm a sham ! !	sh-h-h-h-h ! ! quiet , buzz .

oh , come on , buzz . i ... buzz , i ca n't do this without you . i need your help .	i ca n't help . i ca n't help anyone .
why , sure you can , buzz . you can get me out of here and then i 'll get that rocket off you , and we 'll make a break for andy 's house .	andy 's house . sid 's house . what 's the difference .
oh , buzz , you 've had a big fall . you must not be thinking clearly .	no , woody , for the first time i am thinking clearly . you were right all along . i 'm not a space ranger . i 'm just a toy . a stupid little insignificant toy .
whoa , hey -- wait a minute . being a toy is a lot better than being a space ranger .	yeah , right .
no , it is . look , over in that house is a kid who thinks you are the greatest , and it 's not because you 're a space ranger , pal , it 's because you 're a toy ! you are his toy .	but why would andy want me ?
buzz ! ! what are you doing ? i thought you were --	come on , sheriff . there 's a kid over in that house who needs us . now let 's get you out of this thing .
woody ! it 's the moving van .	we 've got to get out of here ... now .

it does n't matter how much we 're played with . what matters is that we 're here for andy when he needs us . that 's what we 're made for . right ? everyone is now looking down , sheepish .	pardon me . i hate to break up the staff meeting , but they 're here ! birthday guests at three o'clock !
no , no ! turn 'em around , turn 'em around !	eh , he 's puttin ' 'em in backwards !

well , that mistake is sitting in your spot , woody .	have you been replaced ?
oh , really ? i 'm from playskool .	and i 'm from mattel . well , i 'm not actually from mattel , i 'm actually from a smaller company that was purchased in a leveraged buy-out . well , i do n't really understand the financials , but ...
gettin ' kind of tense , are n't you ?	oh , uh , mr. lightyear ? now i 'm curious . what does a space ranger actually do ?
that ai n't no happy child .	he tortures toys -- just for fun .
huh ? ! huh ? ! i told you he was guilty .	who would 've thought he was capable of such atrocities ? !
aa-a-a-a-ah !	will you quit moving around ? !
i 'm sorry . it 's just that i get so nervous before i travel .	how did i get stuck with you as a moving buddy ?
well , obviously she wanted to have the party before the move . i 'm not worried . you should n't be worried .	of course woody ai n't worried ! he 's been andy 's favorite since kindergarten !

you 'll put your clothes here .	there 's no mirror .
i can manage .	excuse me .
he 's a pyjama case , really .	do you know you 've lovely hair , even if you torment it in those braids .
i like plaits .	you 're spoiling your pretty looks . come here .
curled up on the landing like love locked out !	i did like the music .
he ca n't abide a woman in trousers . he says a woman in trousers is a sin against nature .	a sin against < i > what ? < /i >
is there anything else i should know about him ?	speak when you 're spoken to . he likes his women quiet .
i saw his teeth in the bathroom .	he can take out his smile and keep it on a shelf , but , his bite is worse than his bark , is n't that so , old fellow ?
mummy was scared of him , i think . he went to her wedding but he was < i > furious < /i > , you can see it in the photograph .	she got away .
he made that . in his off hours .	it 's as though he 'd trapped a real cuckoo inside .
do n't fret . it 's only his dream . dreams are n't catching , not like measles .	i did n't know about the puppets . it 's a lot to take in , all at once .
i want to go home .	home is where the heart is .
she 's not accustomed to being ignored .	she 'll have to learn .
what was < i > that < /i > in aid of ?	get away from me ...
that 's your beach . this is the story . leda walks by the shore , gathering shells . night comes on . she hears the beating of great wings and sees the approach of the swan . she runs away but it bears down and casts her to the ground . curtain .	is that all ?
finn , there 's a splinter in your left foot . if you do n't let me take the splinter out , it will fester .	go away .
i wo n't do it because he wants me to do it , even if i want to do it .	do what ? oh , i see .
you 're only a young thing .	you 're not so old yourself !
who 's there ?	let me in .
can i come into bed with you for a little while , i feel terrible .	well ... yes . all right . but -
would you mind holding me in your arms for a little while ?	finn -
you < i > are < /i > cold . where have you been ?	i finished it off .
he 'll murder you when he finds out .	he 'll be looking for another apprentice .
i hope he does n't pick on jonathon .	can you move over a wee bit ?
the swan was so ridiculous . all the same , it did scare me .	almighty jove in the shape of a swan .
stop it !	i 've got a present for you ...
finn ...	in my pocket .
reprieve .	i know for a fact he did n't take jonathon . jonathon went off by himself .
somebody could n't wait until dark .	h 'm ?
nothing ... you should n't have given victoria that guinness .	it was only a mouthful !
i thought she was fondest of you , because you were the youngest .	did you now .
surely she is older ?	what difference does < i > that < /i > make ?
how long has -	all the time .
i already lost everything once .	so did i .
but then i had a brother and a sister left .	so had i .
everything is gone , now .	nothing is left but us .
'have ploughed the stormy seas - '	storms ?
they 're going to fly everywhere . mean things . they should have taken us .	we 're too young .
i 'm not too young . juliet was my age .	juliet who ?
i 'm melanie .	you 're late for breakfast .
did you do this ?	victoria -
you 're well built ; how old are you ?	sixteen . well , nearly sixteen .
oh no you ca n't . get on with the painting .	it 's all right , finn .
i appreciate you coming in so early .	judge wakefield , it 's an honor to handle it for you . consider it gone away . she 's a minor ; it probably would 've expunged on her 18th birthday anyway .
still , this was a sensitive issue for me and i wanted to thank you personally .	like i said , open container , p.i. , misdemeanor possession . easy to make it disappear . for you , poof , it 's gone .
one thing bothers me ... that kid they dropped off had coke and heroin in him . serious amounts . he 's lucky he lived . so i got ta ask : what 's your daughter on ?	i do n't know what you mean .
i ... i do n't really know .	is she in any kind of therapy ... professional help ?
no , of course not . she 's one of the top students at her school .	well , i hope it stays that way .
even if that were true , they 're not going to come to your house where you 're waiting for them .	he 's right . they 'll do it when you 're walking somewhere , make it look like street crime .
anna . what 's wrong ? what do you want ?	i ca n't find manolo .
he 's not here .	he never came home last night . was he with you ?
what ? what is it ?	it 's very hard for me to come and tell you this .
why does he need money ?	he has debts . he has gambling debts . he owes a lot of money .
how much ?	nine thousand dollars .
what is he planning on telling them ?	well , you know , he 's going to say about madrigal ... and salazar .
if manolo had n't gone and told them what he did then salazar and madrigal would never have been brought to justice . he did a great thing for tijuana . he did a great thing for mexico .	i want to believe you . i really do .
helena , i 'm so sorry --	arnie , thank god .
i understand . you 're upset . you want to know what 's going on . that 's good .	why are you talking like that ?
good . from now on i want you to expect that every word you utter will be tape-recorded , that the movement of your lips is being read . got it ?	arnie , this is crazy .
got it ? good . do not discuss anything over the telephone . do not talk to the neighbors . stay out of your yard .	what is he being charged with ?
i do n't know , but under no circumstances would i talk about it here . i want you to go home and relax the best you can . continue your life as if nothing has happened . that is very important .	arnie , i feel like alice stepping through the looking glass .
i am on the board of my son 's school . i had a fundraiser for a.l.v . in my front yard . i have a right to know if my husband is a legitimate businessman .	of course he is . i 've known him for twenty years and he does n't jaywalk ...
if all our assets are frozen and our `` sales force '' has scattered ... how am i supposed to survive ? i 'm giving birth in three months . how do i get through this ?	you 're gon na get through it , but the first thing we do is get michael adler to represent carl . we get adler and we beat this thing .
how much do i pay him ?	i suspect he 'll accept his payment in publicity .
this place is swept twice a day . i learned that in miami in '85 . then the u.s. shut down the whole caribbean , but it 's a big game of wack-a-mole . knock it down in miami , it pops up here . and san diego is so much more relaxing .	arnie , i need money . somebody threatened my children . they want a first payment of three million dollars .
helena , if i had it i would give it to you , but i do n't have that kind of money .	arnie , help me . does n't anyone owe us money ?
yes , i told you before , there are people who owe you money but they 're not paying . there 's too much heat on carl .	please . tell me who carl sells to .
even if i knew i would n't tell you . you do not want to come into contact with these people . only carl knows who they are . that 's his real asset . ruiz does n't know them . they do n't know ruiz . church and state .	what about legitimate businesses ? we own a construction concern , real estate --
laundromats for the washing of money . unfortunately , carl had only one successful business .	do n't you have some good news ? is n't there something positive you could say .
sometimes i wonder what i 'll do if carl does n't get out . i 'm not very adept at being on my own . i 've always had a man in my life . always .	i remember when i first met you : little helen watts from the wrong side of somewhere . i had a feeling even then that your survival instincts were pretty well honed .
that was a stupid thing you did . incredibly stupid .	i tried , arnie . and , i will continue to try .
have you gone crazy ? you are not carl . you are n't as good as carl . they are moving the trial to a high security location . the press has gone berserk . the jury will be influenced . stay out of things . let us try to win the case .	that is going to be rather difficult when all the evidence is against us .
helena , please . this is out of your hands .	i know i made things worse . i know that and i 'm sorry , but arnie i need something from you . something only you can help me with .
helena --	i need an introduction to the obregon brothers .
did you get it ?	what are you thinking , calling me at home with a message like that ? you 've compromised me and our relationship --
it 's the same stuff ? from the rainy day stash ?	it 's the same . what happened to what they gave you ?
it 's saturday , arnie . you work too hard .	carl , i 'm running late . i 'm coming right now --
do n't bother .	what ?
so arnie , when were you going to tell me about the 3 million dollars we got in from san francisco two days after i got arrested ?	i was just waiting for the right time .
and you did n't feel like you could trust my wife with this news ?	i just did n't want to take a chance . i did n't want to risk it . it could have been frozen along with everything else .
you had it all figured out . you move into my house . you raise my kids . you sleep with my wife . it was a good plan , arnie .	carl , that 's insane .
so my wife is lying ?	carl , think about it , if i was trying to rip you off , i would have left town after ruiz was killed . i would n't sit next to you in court listening to the dismissal .
arnie , do think there 's a difference between a reason and an excuse , because i do n't think there is .	carl --
like a grateful dead concert .	drugs begin pouring out of america into every other country in the world . canada is completely overwhelmed .
so you know we put the case before the arbitration panel , none of whom had any expertise . superfund is just one of those words . people stop paying attention .	that 's frustrating .
i think she 's lying .	me , too .
we 'll ground her , clip her wings a bit . school and scheduled activities and that 's it until further notice . this has to be handled delicately . dan kelly , in the district attorney 's office , will probably help us out , quietly . christ , this could be embarrassing .	honey , this is difficult , but we 've all had our moments . i tried --
stop . you experimented in college . i do n't want to hear about that .	should we take the quotes off experiment and call it what it is ?
this is different .	why ?
to begin with , she 's only sixteen years-old .	i think she has to find out for herself , on her own . we have to allow her space --
space for what ? to o.d . like that other kid ? i will not send the message that this type of behavior is okay with her parents . because it is n't . correct ?	we do n't want to push her away . these are growing experiences .
how long have you known ?	six months . i found some marijuana , that 's all . and a little pipe about two inches long . i talked with her . she said her friends smoked pot and drank --
explain to me how you could think that i should n't know about this . explain to me how this would n't be relevant to me . as a parent .	she asked me not to .
i think we may have found our mexican drug czar . it 's this general , salazar . at least i 'll have somebody on the other side i can talk to .	does this mean you 're going to be gone more ?
you might want to pencil in a little face-time with your daughter .	barbara --
because i 'm at the edge of my capabilities , robert .	the first thing we have to do is present a unified front .
if you start in on the war metaphors i 'm going to drive this car into a fucking telephone pole .	look , i 'm as worried as you are --
no , i do n't think so . leave me alone , give me money . that 's what i get from our daughter . she has a way of shutting me out that seems very familiar .	yeah , well , she has a way of self- medicating that probably seems familiar , too .
i 'm not the one who has to have three scotches just to walk in the door and say hello .	i have a drink before dinner to take the edge off my day . that 's different .
oh , it is ?	yeah , because the alternative is to be bored to death .
should we bring the police into this ?	no , not yet .
about the other night , i 'm sorry .	me , too .
god , i do n't get it . are we supposed to say to ourselves , be prepared to lose her , be prepared to lose our child ? why does this happen to someone ? how does it happen ?	i do n't know .
my leica 's gone .	so 's the video camera .
where are you going ?	she 'll be at a pawn shop in an hour .
did you meet the president ?	honey , your father knows the president .
czar for life , just like a real czar .	that makes mom the czarina . i 'm a czarette . like anastasia .
none of my friends can fucking believe my dad is the actual drug czar .	caroline --
did you tell dad ?	not yet .
are you going to ?	i do n't know .
is this bad for him ?	what do you think ?
he did n't hang around us . he 's like one of those hippie kids . i 'm not part of that group . it was a party in all these rooms . his girlfriend who i barely know was completely hysterical ... he 's blue , he 's puking ... we did n't want to get in trouble , but what were we supposed to do ? i mean , what would you have done if you had been us ?	how well do you know this boy , seth , who was driving ? you know the police have charged him with a dui and possession of marijuana .
hi .	hi .
what 's up ?	just watching you .
you all right ?	i keep feeling like i 'm forgetting something .
how 's david ?	how 's david ? how 's david ? he 's terrific , carl .
helena --	we watched his father get dragged away by federal agents . i do n't even know how to begin to tell him where you are or when you 're coming back ... or if you 're coming back .
we 'll get through this , i promise . i 'll make it up to you --	how ? supportive letters from prison while i 'm being kicked out of our home ? do you have any idea what is happening out here ? our credit cards are maxed . the people at the bank , you should see their faces when i walk in there . i have a letter from the government telling me that anything i sell from our house will be taken against an income tax lien . our friends are behaving like the crowd at a public hanging . nobody will help us . nobody will take us in . nobody wants anything to do with us . so tell me , carl , how you 're gon na make it up to me . tell me again how we 'll get through this , and maybe while you 're at it you can put your hand up against the glass so we can have a tender moment of connection .
helena --	tell me what to do , carl . i need guidance , not a fucking platitude . i 'm not bringing a child into the kind of life i grew up with . i wo n't do it . i want our life back .
what 's it like ? imagine you 're being accosted by a swarm of beggars in the heart of calcutta , except the beggars are wearing $ 1500 suits and they do n't say `` please '' or `` thank you . ''	what about legalizing everything ? has anybody talked about that ?
what if every country legalized at the same time ?	somehow , i do n't see that happening .
as it happens , the president of the united states , my new boss , the leader of the free world , has me penciled in for some `` face time '' .	will we get invited to the white house ?
i do n't know .	how long 's the job ?
where is it ? where are the drugs ? where are they ?	fuck you . i was n't doing anything . you 're like the gestapo .
okay , young lady , that 's it .	like i give a fuck .
what is wrong with you ? what ? you 're going away . you 're getting help somewhere .	you ca n't make me .
... how old are you ?	sixteen
live with your parents ?	yes .
parents still together ?	yes .
do you work ?	i volunteer . i read to blind people . one day a week for two hours .
in school ?	cincinnati country day .
private ?	yeah .
how are your grades ?	i 'm third in my class .
what 's that mean ?	i get a 's . all a 's .
you do ? what else you do ?	i 'm a national merit finalist . i 'm on the hi-q team and the math team . i 'm in the spanish club . i 'm a thespian . i 'm vice-president of my class . i 'm on the volleyball team .
what are you doing ?	just watch .
inhale the smoke and hold it .	what is this , like freebase ?
ach , that 's what i 'm talking about . sarcasm . always fucking sarcasm . you 're afraid and you think if you admit it people will think you 're weak or wo n't like you --	we live our lives by these unspoken rules that are handed to us .
are you kidding ... i 'm staying with you --	he 's gon na fucking die right here on the kitchen floor --
you know my dad takes eight red cold pills every day ? he and my mom have cocktail hour every night , from six to seven , set your clock , two bourbons --	maybe we could show up and smoke a little rock with them to unwind --
yeah , then some dope to take the edge off at the end of a long day .	have you done your homework , honey ?
yes , mom --	then here 's a little bump .
did courtney love play nancy in syd and nancy ?	i think so . if she did n't she should have . i 've only got maybe an hour . then volleyball practice is over and i have to be home .
no telltales . nothing to read . not touching my face . not even blinking . no giveaways . how 're you feeling ?	i feel good .
no more pissant basin league bullshit for us , hunh ?	nope .
chill out --	it 's a funny fuckin ' joke and it 's quick . why do women wear makeup and perfume ?
move 'em to texas , fry 'em up .	we got you on tape making the deal . we got you bragging about the quality . we got you bragging about your business . we got you .
that 's a big word for a fisherman .	who do you work for ?
they 're whispering . i ca n't hear them , but i know it . i smell conspiracy . i feel the lie vibrating out of the home .	she ai n't in on it .
i have dreams about this , actual dreams about busting the top people , the rich people , the white people .	i 'm telling you , she does n't know shit .
she knows arnie metzger .	so does half of san diego .
you should see little montel play . little montel is the next maradona .	maradona is a cokehead . hand of god , my ass . we 're wasting our time here .
he won . he was a winner . that bothers you .	winners do n't do coke . or have n't you been reading the bumper stickers ?
are you getting this on tape ?	i love my job . i love it . the next time i 'm having a bad day you got ta remind me of right now and i 'll get over it .
what do we do ?	i do n't know .
what do you think she wants ?	she 's your girlfriend . open it , talk about your kids .
remember when we sat on that mob guy , that chef , for like six months ?	oh , man , i 've never eaten so good in my life . why do n't you develop a useful skill ?
what do you think it is ?	depends who it 's from .
your friends at warren , putnam and hudson .	you can learn a lot about somebody from this stuff . three categories : you like me , you hate me , you want something from me . definitely third category .
what would a law firm want from the new drug czar ?	depends on the state .
arizona .	medicinal marijuana initiative . or am i being cynical ?
i 'll put this in the back .	no --
all the professionals keep them in the trunk .	not tiger woods .
david --	we 're playing !
women 's room , stall two . should we stop for ice-cream ?	yeah !
yes .	i 'm on a special phone , may i speak freely ?
you may speak .	i have a job for you and i do n't have much time .
you were followed by the police , but they wo n't hear us over the children . i want to use a bomb .	you 're kidding . ca n't you shoot him or something ?
i do n't really like guns . you shoot someone in the head three times and some doctor will keep them alive .	when will you do it ?
i do n't know . eduardo ruiz is the only real witness against carl . the security is very tight . there may not be a way .	there 's always a way . if people get to the pope or the president , you can get to him .
they 're going to walk right past me .	what are you ? a mouse ? get out of the car and do it . this is your chance .
so , it 's worth the wait , right ? what can i do ? rent a huey ? have an airlift ? it 's not like you can put it in a condom up some mule 's asshole , right ? how many peasants would that take ? a line stretching from here to mexico city --	nobody said shit , eduardo --
you planning on going somewhere , eduardo ? you do n't like it here ? this is the best situation you 're going to have for a long , long time .	i am a legitimate business . fishing boats . tuna . check it out . tax records , everything --
listen you motherfucker , you tried to kill me with a fucking cannon .	you ca n't visit me here . i want my lawyer .
one chance here , eduardo . make us believe you got a boss . no boss , it 's all on you .	it 's a death sentence . i 'll never make it to the trial .
carlos , i mean carl , started out in the family connection business : real estate in tijuana , fishing boats out of ensenada , hydroponic raspberries . he met up with the obregon brothers of the tijuana cartel who were interested in two things : entering society and using his fishing boats .	so you pay off our customs officials ?
this attitude 's not gon na help him any , is it ?	i got greedy . i decided to bring a little in on my own and somebody tipped you off . that was my mistake . carl would never be so stupid .
he hired you . that was a mistake .	carl and i were friends from childhood . he was loyal , that 's not a mistake .
this is ridiculous . why is there no elevator ?	when the dea gets into the narcotics business , then we 'll stay at the four seasons .
you expect me to be grateful for spending the rest of my life looking over my shoulder .	that thought makes me feel awful .
ca n't you for a second imagine none of this had happened ? that my drugs had gone through . what would have been the harm ? a few people get high who are getting high anyway . your partner is still alive . we avoid having breakfast together . do n't you see this means nothing ? that your whole life is pointless ?	you 're breaking my heart .
the worst thing about you , monty , is you realize the futility of what you 're doing and you do it anyway . i wish you could see how transparent you are . this food tastes like shit .	so go shower already .
i want to know who is responsible for this treatment .	yes , sir !
we are n't barbarians .	yes , sir !
bring this man a change of good clothes . has he eaten ?	i do n't know , sir .
yes , he threatened to kill my five year-old son . i was under the impression i would be meeting juan obregon .	no , this is not possible . and i thank you for coming down here , though i suspect it 's been a pointless journey .
why do you say that , mr. marquez ?	i hear these stories . your husband in jail . his business in chaos . various people fighting over the scraps .
my husband is the victim of an informer in your organization , not ours .	that is not true , mrs. ayala . your route is compromised . perhaps it is time for me to deal with other distributors in california .
i do n't think you 're going to do that .	you do n't ? listen to this woman in a man 's world , a very violent world .
there are plenty of other suppliers in mexico .	but not in whose interest it is to help you out of debt .
my husband had been working on something he called , the project for the children . are you aware of this ?	i do n't know . perhaps i remember something .
we have the ability to change the color , odor , and physical property of cocaine .	you want to smuggle narcotics in mr. espastico jacobo . that 's nothing new .
every part , from his ears to his accessory belt , is high-impact , pressure-molded cocaine . odorless . undetectable by dogs . undetectable by anyone .	i do n't believe you .
you first .	i 'm six months pregnant . i wo n't do it .
fine , then we do n't have deal .	fine , then we do n't have a deal .
that 's good coke .	it should be ... it 's yours . i want our debt forgiven . i want to be the exclusive distributor of obregon brothers cocaine for the united states . and i want the principle witness against my husband , eduardo ruiz , killed .
take this back with you . deliver it safely to tigrillo in san diego and we have a deal .	that 's crazy . my husband is on trial for smuggling .
you will help me with my other problem .	deliver that safely to tigrillo in san diego . and we have a deal .
was n't that general salazar ?	yeah .
what 's he doing up here ?	i do n't know . something .
relax . if they were going to kill us they would have done it in the desert .	they would n't do it in front of all these people . they 'd send someone later , when we 're alone .
if you want her to stay out of it , then stop telling her everything . you should learn how to keep a secret .	she 's nosy . she hears me on the telephone .
please . filing a report will not help you find your car .	the police wo n't find your car .
this is fucking crazy . instead of killing us , he sends us on a suicide mission . do you know who frankie flowers is ? he 's a psycho-cokehead- hitman . a faggot . he 's killed fucking who knows how many people . you 'd need half the force to get close to him . and you ca n't get their help because he lives in fucking san diego .	then i guess i 'm going by myself .
a group of us are going out tonight .	who ?
guzman , tomas , esteban --	your new friends .
yeah . it should be fun . you wan na come ?	not this time .
it 's no problem . i was just with everybody we work with .	oh , really . general salazar was there ?
no , but a lot of other people . you should come . you should come out with us .	go home . get cleaned up . get to work . salazar is heading down to mexico city next week and i 'm not getting left behind . do n't fuck this up .
madrigal 's alive .	what ?
javi ! come on . do n't pull this you do n't care bullshit . this is incredible information . it must be . javi --	we keep our mouths shut .
somewhere safe .	where ?
a place we have , that we know is protected .	no .
it 's important that we work together . mexico . america . one hand washing the other .	we agree .
so ... maybe you tell me about your informants in our operations .	we thought maybe you 'd have that kind of information for us .
you should feel good about this .	i feel like a traitor .
what 's your name ?	javier rodriguez .
one question . how did you find about this ?	an informant .
what is the name of your informant ?	it was an anonymous tip .
that 's your past . i want to talk about your future . would you be willing to do something for me ?	if i can .
i 'm trying to bust the tijuana cartel .	what is it you want me to do ?
does this offer include my partner ?	only if he can be trusted .
i 'm curious how you did this with such economy .	everybody has a weakness .
you watch and learn . i earn his trust . then more pain . then i appear with kindness . within a week he will follow me around like a dog .	but will he be house-trained ?
the cocaine brand , 911 , is an east coast brand , a juarez cartel brand , and you must know it usually comes through into el paso ?	i 'm aware of that .
let me ask you a hypothetical question : if salazar worked for madrigal and the juaraz cartel , and he went out of power , would it mean the juarez cartel is losing influence ?	it could mean that , yes .
that would probably mean the tijuana cartel is gaining power ?	it 's possible .
my work keeps me young .	which part , getting terrorists loose on bail or freeing convicted murderers on technicalities ?
the worst serial killer in history - who ? gacy - right ? killed forty two people . our government killed fifty thousand in vietnam and lied about it every day .	michael , you represent drug dealers , not civil libertarians .
we kidnapped noriega out of panama . is that covered in your constitution ? because it is n't in mine .	noriega is a criminal .
noriega was head of a sovereign nation who made the mistake of doing business with the u.s. government . so , no , i do n't have a problem waking up every day and fighting our government , fighting people like you , trying to keep this system a little bit honest .	last i read your clients were chopping people up with chainsaws and delivering illegal narcotics into this country .
i hope when you were on the bench , judge wakefield , you did n't handle the presumption of innocence in the same fashion .	if i ever return to the bench , counselor adler , i hope i have the pleasure of hearing your arguments .
the busiest land border crossing in the world . over forty-one thousand vehicles per day , twenty-two thousand pedestrians on foot . i think we do a pretty good job but we know a lot of drugs are still getting through .	any idea how much ?
i 've read official estimates but i would n't bet my house on them . i 've heard the entire cocaine supply for the united states can fit into four tractor-trailers . at least a half-dozen of those cars right out there are carrying a load of dope , with drivers employed by people who do n't give a damn if they 're caught or not .	what do you look for ?
we ask questions and measure the answers . when something does n't ring true , a fact that does n't make sense , a slight hesitation , then it 's off to secondary for a closer look . before nafta we had about 1.9 million trucks a year . now it 's almost double . pretty soon there 'll be mexican truck companies that will have as much freedom in crossing the border as american truck companies .	any way we can do it better ?
sure . more money in intelligence on their side of the border . so we have a better idea who we 're looking for . more dogs . more people . supposed to be getting some giant x- ray machines to run the trucks through . outside of martial law that 's about the best you 're gon na do . but , i should tell you , there are two things that really have us on edge right now . in the last six months seizures have tripled , even though we 're pulling over the same number of cars . what does that tell you ?	that triple the amount of stuff is going through .
i 'm looking for my daughter , caroline . she comes here .	this is a business . get the fuck outta here .
who the fuck do you think you are ? where the fuck do you think you are ? why the fuck do you think i should n't just put you in a dumpster ?	i have money --
i got money .	i 'll pay you a thousand dollars . i have it in my wallet .
i want your money , i 'll take your money .	just tell me where she is .
she 's not at that place you sent her ?	she snuck away . and we have n't seen her . she has n't come home .
oh , man --	she has n't called you ?
can you tell me anything ? do you have any ideas ?	i do n't know what to say .
i 'm not the police . i do n't care about experimentation . she 's a kid . i 'm worried to death .	you wo n't say anything to my parents ?
i do n't give a fuck about your parents --	we sometimes went downtown to score .
what ?	the west end . we buy it off the streets . i can stop , you know , and she ca n't . two people , really similar , we can talk about anything , but for me it 's like a weekend thing , then i get my shit together , and for her it 's different --
hey man , i 'm sorry . i 'm just trying to help .	you want to help ? stay the fuck away from her .
i do n't know , maybe we missed her .	i ca n't believe you used to bring my daughter here , to this place .
i recruited the best men in mexico for my task force and put them through a rigorous screening process . not only physical , but also psychological .	i 'd like to bring you up to washington , walk you around our side of things , and share some of the information we 've been able to develop on your cartels .
you 've been making very good progress against the tijuana cartel .	yes , i am confident that juan obregon will be taken into custody before the end of the year . but , you must understand that it is very difficult because of corruption in the police force . we get a tip that he is one place , then we get there and he is already gone , having been warned by someone on our side .
hopefully the exchange of training methods and information between our countries will help with this problem .	yes , i hope so as well .
let me ask you a related question . we 've talked about the supply side , but what about demand ? what is your policy for treating addiction ?	addicts treat themselves ... they overdose and then there 's one less to worry about .
i just want to be clear about one thing . i used to work for him , but now i work for you . i 'm not a partisan person , i 'm an issue person . in the next few weeks , if you allow me , we 'll get you well-versed on an incredible array of issues . the most important of which , in my opinion , being mexico . i know everybody that you 're gon na meet . it 's important that they like you . it 's not important that they like me . that 's why i can help protect you .	like you protected landry ?
hello .	i 'm sorry ... did i wake you ?
salazar 's been taken down . he was working for porfirio madrigal .	what ? i thought madrigal was dead . i thought it was verified .
apparently not . look , it 's a shit storm here right now . when are you coming back ? i do n't know what to tell people any more .	i 'll get there as soon as i can .
who are these guys ?	agents who died in the field .
he died in a liposuction surgery , right ?	right . now it 's used by somebody from the juarez cartel , one of his lieutenants ... who knows ? every damn day there 's birthday party . at first i thought they must have three hundred children , then i realized they 're taunting us . three miles away and we ca n't touch them . ha , ha , ha .
who do we interface with on their side ?	what do you mean ?
i mean , who runs interdiction on the mexico side ?	i do n't know . i do n't think there 's any one person . see the problem is the juarez cartel owns everything and everybody , all the property on the mexican side , sometimes all the property on both sides . warehouses , transportation , even tunnels . it 's very organized .
what do we do ? okay . fucked-up bowman 's turning blue . doctor . we need a doctor .	your dad 's a doctor . call him --
he 's a research doctor . you 're dad 's a doctor , too --	what kind of research ?
mapping the fucking pig genome . we 'll call your dad , he 's a neurosurgeon --	it 's three a.m. i 'm not supposed to be here . i snuck out --
did you tell him ?	no . on you go .
what ?	the cards . the last thing i said to you was mind the cards .
well , i 've not brought them .	it 's fucking boring after a while without the cards .
well , i 've not brought them .	it 's fucking boring after a while without the cards .
i 'm sorry .	bit fucking late , like .
well , why did n't you bring them ?	because i fucking told you to do that , you doss cunt .
ok. same again ?	i 'm off for a pish . when i come back , that money 's still here , ok ?
i 'll be right after you .	you 'll never catch us , you flabby bastard . right , see , when i come back --
i want the money , mark , that 's all .	if everyone keeps their mouth shut , there 'll be no one going to jail .
i do n't know , maybe i 'll buy something for my ma , and then buy some good speed , no bicarb like , then get a girl , take her out like , and treat her -- properly .	shag her senseless .
no , i do n't mean like that -- i mean something nice , like , that 's all --	you daft cunt . if you 're going to waste it like that , you might as well leave it all to me . now get the drinks in .
shut you mouth or you 'll be next .	you 've stabbed me , man .
twenty thousand .	but it 's not worth more than fifteen .
for fuck 's sake .	sorry , mate , i 'll get you another .
all down my fucking front , you fucking idiot .	look , i 'm sorry , i did n't mean it .
and remember , rents : no skag .	aye , ok , fr . but the good times could n't last for ever .
it 's a scandal , franco .	too right it is . now look , have you got anything to eat , 'cos i 'm fucking lee marvin , by the way .
what ?	i 've no fucking cigarettes .
hey , i 'm wanting a bet put on .	can you not go yourself .
i 'm no a fucking buftie and that 's the end of it .	let 's face it , it could have been wonderful .
yes , you fucking do . i 've seen your statement .	jesus .
two thousand , one hundred and thirty- three pounds .	four kilos . that 's what -- ten years ' worth ? russian sailors ? mikey forrester ? what the fuck are you on these days ? you 've been to jail , spud , so what 's the deal -- like it so much you want to go back again ?
this was his nightmare . the dodgiest scam in a lifetime of dodgie scams being perpetrated with three of the most useless and unreliable fuck-ups in town . i knew what was going on in his mind : any trouble in london and he would dump us immediately , one way or another . he had to . if he got caught with a bagful of skag , on top of that armed robbery shit , he was going down for fifteen to twenty . begbie was hard , but not so hard that he did n't shite it off twenty years in saughton .	did you bring the cards ?
buy yourself that island in the sun ?	for four fucking grand ? one palm tree , a couple of rocks , and a sewage outflow .
we 'll be half-way down the road with the money .	i 'd fucking kill you .
cool down , franco . the guy 's sorry .	not sorry enough for being a fat cunt .
excuse me , i do n't mean to harass you , but i was very impressed by the capable and stylish manner in which you dealt with that situation . i thought to myself : she 's special .	thanks .
what 's your name ?	diane .
where are you going , diane ?	i 'm going home .
where 's that ?	it 's where i live .
great .	what ?
do you find that this approach usually works , or , let me guess , you 've never tried it before . in fact , you do n't normally approach girls , am i right ? the truth is that you 're a quite , sensitive type but if i 'm prepared to take a chance i might just get to know the inner you : witty , adventurous , passionate , loving , loyal , a little bit crazy , a little bit bad , but , hey , do n't us girls just love that ?	eh-
well , what 's wrong , boy ? cat got your tongue .	think i left something back at the -
diane .	ssshh !
sorry .	shut up .
christ , i have n't felt that good since archie gemmill scored against holland in 1978 .	right . you ca n't sleep here .
what ?	out .
come on .	no argument . you can sleep on the sofa in the living room , or go home . it 's up to you .
jesus .	and do n't make any noise .
i do n't see why not .	because it 's illegal .
holding hands ?	no , not holding hands .
in that case you can do it . you were quite happy to do a lot more last night .	and that 's what 's illegal . do you know what they do to people like me inside ? they 'd cut my balls off and flush them down the fucking toilet .
calm down . you 're not going to jail .	easy for you to say .
can i see you again ?	certainly not .
what do you want ?	are you clean ?
yes .	is that a promise , then ?
yes , as a matter of fact , it is .	calm down , i 'm just asking . is that hash i can smell ?
no .	i would n't mind a bit , if it is .
well , it is n't .	smells like it .
you 're too young .	too young for what ?
you 're not getting any younger , mark . the world is changing , music is changing , even drugs are changing . you ca n't stay in here all day dreaming about heroin and ziggy pop .	it 's iggy pop .
whatever . i mean , the guy 's dead anyway .	iggy pop is not dead . he toured last year . tommy went to see him .
it 's so simple . we buy it at four grand , we punt it at twenty to this guy that sick boy knows , and he punts it at sixty . everyone 's happy , everyone 's in profit . i put up two . i come away with six .	unless you get caught .
so long as everyone keeps their mouths shut , we 'll not be getting caught .	so why have you told me about it ?
well , you 're not going to tell anyone , are you , and besides , i thought we could meet up afterwards , maybe go somewhere together .	i 've got a boyfriend , mark .
what ? steady like ?	that 's right : 'going steady ' for four weeks now .
and what age are you ? thirteen ? fourteen ?	sixteen next month .
happy birthday .	what do you think -- i should be carrying a torch for you ?
so , what 's he like ?	well , he 's young and he 's healthy .
i read it in cosmopolitan .	it 's an interesting theory .
actually it 's a nightmare . i 've been desperate for a shag , but watching him suffer was just too much fun . you should try it with tommy .	what , and deny myself the only pleasure i get from him ? did i tell you about my birthday ?
what happened ?	he forgot . useless motherfucker .
tommy knew he had the virus , like , but never knew he 'd gone full-blown .	what was it , pneumonia or cancer ?
no , toxoplasmosis . sort of like a stroke .	eh ? how 's that ?
i bet lizzy told him where to put it .	exactly . i 'm not wanting a cat , she says . get to fuck , right . so there 's tommy stuck with this kitten . you can imagine what happened . the thing was neglected , pissing and shitting all over the place . tommy was lying around fucked out of his eyeballs on smack or downers . he did n't know you could get toxoplasmosis from cat shit .
tommy , let 's put the tape on .	now ?
yes , i want to watch ourselves while we 're screwing .	fuck , ok .
what do you mean , it 's 'gone ' ? where has it gone , tommy ?	it 'll be here somewhere . i might have returned it by mistake .
well , mr. renton , i see that you attended the royal edinburgh college .	indeed , yes , those halcyon days .
one of edinburgh 's finest schools .	oh , yes , indeed . i look back on my time there with great fondness and affection . the debating society , the first eleven , the soft know of willow on leather --
i 'm an old boy myself , you know ?	oh , really ?
do you recall the school motto ?	of course , the motto , the motto --
strive , hope , believe and conquer .	exactly . those very words have been my guiding light in what is , after all , a dark and often hostile world .
no , actually i went to craignewton but i was worried that you would n't have heard of it so i put the royal edinburgh college instead , because they 're both schools , right , and we 're all in this together , and i wanted to put across the general idea rather than the details , yeah ? people get all hung up on details , but what 's the point ? like which school ? does it matter ? why ? when ? where ? or how many o grades did i get ? could be six , could be one , but that 's not important . what 's important is that i am , right ? that i am .	mr. murphy , do you mean that you lied on your application ?
only to get my foot in the door . showing initiative , right ?	you were referred here by the department of employment . there 's no need for you to get you `` foot in the door '' , as you put it .
thank you , mr. murphy . we 'll let you know .	the pleasure was mine . best interview i 've ever been to . thanks .
morning , spud . sit down and have some breakfast .	sorry about last night -
i 'll put the sheets in the washing machine just now .	no , i 'll wash them . i 'll take them home and bring them back .
there 's no need .	it 's no problem .
no problem for me either . honestly , it 's no problem .	i 'd really rather take care of it myself .
are you getting out much ?	no .
following the game at all ?	no .
you take the test ?	aye .
clear ?	aye .
that 's nice .	i 'm sorry , tommy .
have you got any gear on you ?	no , i 'm clean .
thanks , mark .	no problem . no problem -- easy to say when its some other poor cunt with shite for blood .
good luck , spud .	cheers .
now remember --	yeah .
if they think you 're not trying , you 're in trouble . first hint of that , they 'll be on to the dss , 'this cunt 's no trying ' and your giro is fucking finished , right ?	right .
but try too hard --	and you might get the fucking job .
exactly .	nightmare .
it 's a tightrope , spud , a fucking tightrope .	my problem is that i tend to clam up . i go dumb and i ca n't answer any questions at all . nerves on the big occasion , like a footballer .
a little too well , if anything , a little too well , that 's my only fear , compadre .	another dab ?
i chose not to choose life : i chose something else . and the reasons ? there are no reasons . who need reasons when you 've got heroin ?	goldfinger 's better than dr. no . both of them are a lot better than diamonds are forever a judgement reflected in its relative poor showing at the box office , in which field , of course , thunderball was a notable success .
people think it 's all about misery and desperation and death and all that shite , which is not to be ignored , but what they forget - spud is shooting up for the pleasure of it . otherwise we would n't do it . after all , we 're not fucking stupid . at least , we 're not that fucking stupid . take the best orgasm you ever had , multiply it by a thousand and you 're still nowhere near it . when you 're on junk you have only one worry : scoring . when you 're off it you are suddenly obliged to worry about all sorts of other shite . got no money : ca n't get pished . got money : drinking too much . ca n't get a bird : no chance of a ride . got a bird : too much hassle . you have to worry about bills , about food , about some football team that never fucking wins , about human relationships and all the things that really do n't matter when you 've got a sincere and truthful junk habit .	i would say , in those days , he was a muscular actor , in every sense , with all the presence of someone like cooper or lancaster , but combined with a sly wit to make him a formidable romantic lead , closer in that respect to cary grant .
you only live twice ?	nineteen-sixty-seven .
running time ?	one hundred and sixteen minutes .
director ?	lewis gilbert .
screenwriter ?	eh - ian fleming ?
fuck off ! he never wrote any of them .	ok , so who was it , then ?
who wrote it ?	but you 're looking better , it has to be said . healthier . radiant even .
you do n't know , do you ?	and i wondered if you 'd care to go to the park tomorrow .
the park ?	tomorrow afternoon . usual set-up .
who wrote it ?	roald dahl .
it 's certainly a phenomenon in all walks of life .	what do you mean ?
well , at one time , you 've got it , and then you lose it , and it 's gone for ever . all walks of life : george best , for example , had it and lost it , or david bowie , or lou reed -	some of his solo stuff 's not bad .
no , it 's not bad , but it 's not great either , is it ? and in your heart you kind of know that although it sounds all right , it 's actually just shite .	so who else ?
charlie nicholas , david niven , malcolm mclaren , elvis presley . -	ok , ok , so what 's the point you 're trying to make ?
all i 'm trying to do is help you understand that the name of the rose is merely a blip on an otherwise uninterrupted downward trajectory .	what about the untouchables ?
i do n't rate that at all .	despite the academy award ?
that means fuck all . the sympathy vote .	right . so we all get old and then we ca n't hack it any more . is that it ?
yeah .	that 's your theory ?
yeah , beautifully fucking illustrated .	give me the gun .
do you see the beast ? have you got it in you sights ?	clear enough , moneypenny . this should present no significant problem .
i think allison had been screaming all day , but it had n't really registered before . she might have been screaming for a week for all i knew . it 's been days since i 've heard anyone speak , though surely someone must have said something in all that time , surely to fuck someone must have .	what 's wrong , allison ?
oh , fuck . sick boy reaches out to allison .	it was n't my baby . she was n't my baby . baby dawn . she was n't mine . spud 's ? swanney 's ? sick boy 's ? i do n't know . maybe allison knew . maybe not . i wished i could think of something to say , something sympathetic , something human .
say something , mark , say something --	i 'm cooking ' up . there is a silence .
eughh . sounds horrible .	it was n't that bad .
did he -- you know ?	what ?
you know .	no , he did n't make me touch it .
oh no , do n't even mention it .	he made me lick it .
god , you 're sick .	and i got a stitch stuck between my teeth , jerked my head back and the whole fucking stump fell off .
cut it out .	when are you going to visit him ?
do n't know . maybe thursday .	you 're a real mate . and what about tommy ? have you been to see him yet ?
fuck you . ok , so tommy 's got the virus . bad news , big deal . the gig goes on , or had n't you noticed ? swanney fucks his leg up . well , tough shit , but it could have been worse .	you 're all hear .
i know a couple of addicts . stupid wee lassies . i feed them what they need . a little bit of skag to keep them happy while the punters line up at a fiver a skull . it 's easy money for me . not exactly a fortune , but i 'm thinking , 'i should be coining it here . ' less whores , more skag . swanney 's right . get clean , get into dealing , that 's where the future lies . set up some contacts , get a good load of skag , punt it , profit . what do you think ?	fuck you .
i ca n't believe you did that .	i got a good price for it . rents , i need the money .
it was my fucking television .	well , christ , if i 'd known you were going to get so humpty about it , i would n't have bothered . are you going to eat that ?
why ?	well , this guy i 've met runs a hotel . brother . loads of contacts . does a nice little sideline in punting british passports to foreigners . get you a good price .
why would i want to sell my passport ?	it was just an idea .
what ?	there 's a mate of swanney 's . mikey forrester -- you know the guy . he 's come into some gear . a lot of gear .
how much ?	about four kilos . so he tells me . got drunk in a pub down by the docks last week , where he met two russian sailors . they 're fucking carrying the stuff . for sale there and then , like . so he wakes up the next morning , realizes what he 's done and get very fucking nervous . wants rid of this . { -- -- -- -- -- he 's looking for swanney to punt it , but swanney 's nowhere to be seen since he lost his leg . -- -- -- -- -- }
so ?	so he met me and i offered to take it off his hands at a very reasonable price , with the intention of punting it on myself to a guy i know in london .
what was your price ?	four grand .
but you do n't have the money ?	we 're two thousand short .
that 's tough .	come on , mark , every cunt knows you 've been saving up down in london .
from time to time , even i have uttered the magic words .	are you serious ?
yeah . no more . i 'm finished with that shite .	well , it 's up to you .
i 'm going to get it right this time . going to get it set up and get off it for good .	sure , sure . i 've heard it before .
the sick boy method .	yeah , well , it surely worked for him .
he 's always been lacking in moral fibre .	he knows a lot about sean connery .
that 's hardly a substitute .	you 'll need one more hit .
no , i do n't think so .	to see you through the night that lies ahead .
what 's on the menu this evening ?	your favourite dish .
excellent .	your usual table , sir ?
and would sir care to settle his bill in advance ?	stick it on my tab .
regret to inform , sir , that your credit limit was reached and breached a long time ago .	in that case --
no , thank you . i 'll proceed directly to the intravenous injection of hard drugs , please .	as you wish .
great .	and see when i get out of here . i 've got plans . going to get myself straightened out and head off to thailand , where women really know how to treat a guy . see , out there you can live like a king if you 've got white skin and a few crisp tenners in your pocket . no fucking problem .
sure .	the strategy is this : get clean , get mobile , get into dealing , and this time next year i 'll be watching the rising sun with a posse of oriental buttocks parked on my coupon .
sounds great , swanney .	yeah .
you 'll have to send us a postcard .	sure will , pal , sure will .
this had better be good .	it will be . it 'll make a change for three miserable junkies who do n't know what they want to do with themselves since they stopped doing smack .
if i 'm giving up a whole day and the price of a ticket , i 'm just saying it had better be good . there 's plenty of other things i could be doing .	such as ?
there .	are you serious ?
it 's the great outdoors .	it 's really nice , tommy . can we go home now ?
it 's fresh air .	look , tommy , we know you 're getting a hard time off lizzy , but there 's no need to take it out on us .
how 's it going with gail ?	no joy yet .
how long is it ?	six weeks .
six weeks !	it 's a nightmare . she told me she did n't want our relationship to start on a physical basis as that is how it would be principally defined from then on in .
where did she come up with that ?	she read it in cosmopolitan .
six weeks and no sex ?	i 've got balls like watermelons , i 'm telling you .
useless motherfucker , that 's what she called me . i told her , i 'm sorry , but theses things happen . let 's put it behind us .	that 's fair enough .
yes , but then she finds out i 've bought a ticket for iggy pop the same night .	went ballistic ?
big time . absolutely fucking radge . 'it 's me or iggy pop , time to decide . '	so what 's it going to be ?
we go for a walk .	what ?
a walk .	but where ?
well , what are you waiting for ?	i do n't know , tommy . i do n't know if it 's ... normal .
what do you see as your main strengths ?	i love people . all people . even people that no one else loves , i think they 're ok , you know . like beggars .
homeless people ?	no , not homeless people . beggars , francis begbie -- one of my mates . i would n't say my best mate , i mean , sometimes the boy goes over the score , like one time when we -- me and him -- were having a laugh and all of a sudden he 's fucking gubbed me in the face , right --
mr. murphy , { leaving your friend aside , } do you see yourself as having any weaknesses ?	no . well , yes . i have to admit it : i 'm a perfectionist . for me , it 's the best or nothing at all . if things go badly , i ca n't be bothered , but i have a good feeling about this interview . seems to me like it 's gone pretty well . we 've touched on a lot of subjects , a lot of things to think about , for all of us .
qual se tu ?	it is i. the journey you undertook to reach me could not have been an easy one .
it was not . the barrier stood between us - but we breached it .	magnificent . you are the first to find me .
we sought only your infinite wisdom .	and how did you breach the barrier ?
with a starship !	this starship , could it carry my wisdom beyond the barrier ?
it could . yes .	then i shall make use of this starship .
he has his doubts ...	you doubt me ?
why ? why have you done this to my friend ?	he doubts me .
no , no , it 's not possible .	bring me the ship or i will destroy you !
the ship ... .	bring it closer so that i might join with it . do it , or watch these puny things die horribly .
i could n't help but notice you pain .	my pain ?
bad news , gentlemen . shore leave 's been cancelled .	rescued at last .
do n't tell them you 're lost . you 'll never live it down .	is there a problem , gentlemen ?
my visual says sunny skies and seventy degrees .	sulu ! look ! the sun 's come out ! it 's a miracle !
admit it . we 're lost .	all right , we 're lost . but we 're making good time .
um ... yes . we 've been caught in a blizzard !	and we ca n't see a thing . request you direct us to the coordinates .
sulu , what are you doing ?	plotting our new course .
new course ? you have no authority . what 's going on here ?	pavel .
following new course . warp seven .	estimating destination in 6.7 hours , present speed .
in firing position . torpedo armed .	but , captain , we 're firing directly on your position .
shuttle en route .	position , bird of prey ?
mr. chekov , i 've lost the bird of prey . she must have cloaked .	raise shields .
but the shuttle-	do it . go to red alert .
what 's emergency landing plan b ?	i do n't have a clue .
this is the starship enterprise .	a federation starship .
this is captain pavel chekov speaking . you are in violation of neutral zone treaty . i advise you to release your hostages at once or suffer the consequences .	your threats amuse me , captain chekov . what consequences did you have in mind ?
you are a master of understatement . they are likely to destroy the planet .	then it 's fortunate that i have you and your starship to protect me . in the meantime , captain chekov , i instruct you and your first officer to beam down to my coordinates .
what 's going on ?	i instruct you to surrender . you are under attack by federation forces .
can we have it quiet ?	enterprise , this is starfleet operations . come in .
bob ?	jim ... ? well , we 're dressing informally , are n't we ?
you caught me on my way to the shower .	i apologize for canceling shore leave , but look , we have a dangerous situation out on nimbus iii .
on `` the planet of galactic peace ? ''	the same . from what we can make out , a terrorist force has captured the only settlement . and they 've taken hostages .
the klingon , the romulan , the federation consuls . now i know enterprise is not exactly up to specs ...	with all due respect , the enterprise is a disaster . there must be other ships in the quadrant .
other ships , yes . but no experienced commanders . captain , i need jim kirk .	oh , please .
your orders are to proceed to nimbus iii , assess the situation and avoid a confrontation if possible . above all , however , get those hostages back safely .	have the klingons responded ?
no , but you can bet they will .	understood . kirk out .
besides , i ca n't believe you 'd kill me for a field of empty holes .	it 's all i have .
your pain runs deep .	what do you know of my pain ?
where did you get this power ?	the power was within you .
i feel as if a weight has been lifted from my heart . how can i repay you for this miracle ?	join my quest .
what is it you seek ?	what you seek . what all men have sought since time began - ultimate knowledge . but to find it we 'll need a starship .
a starship ? there are no starships on nimbus iii .	perhaps i have a way to bring one here .
but how ?	have faith , my friend . there are more of us than you know .
you told me you could have the ship operational in two weeks . i gave you three . what happened ?	i think you gave me too much time , captain .
very well , mr. scott . carry on .	aye , captain how many times do i have to tell you ? the right tool for the right job ...
do n't you worry , captain . we 'll beat those klingon devils even if i have to get out and push .	i hope it wo n't come to that , mr. scott .
scotty here , captain . transporter is still inoperative . even if we could lock onto the hostages , we could n't beam them up .	then we 'll have to get them out the old fashioned way .
captain , we ca n't trust anyone now .	if we could send a distress signal ...
mr. scott , get the transporter working . if we contact a rescue ship we 'll need it . which way to the turbo shaft ?	head down that tunnel to the hydro vent and turn right . then left at the blowscreen . you ca n't miss it .
she 's got partial power , sir . i might be able to take two of you .	beam up spock and dr. mccoy . now !
mr. scott apologizes for having to send the shuttlecraft . the transporter beam is non-operational . captain , we 've received important orders from starlet command .	why did n't you beep my communicator ?
captain , starfleet transmission on line .	put it on the veiwscreen , would you please ?
captain , we 're receiving the hostage information you requested .	put it on the screen .
standard orbit , mr. sulu .	captain , we 're receiving transmission from paradise city . they 're demanding to know our intentions .
respond with static . let them think we 're having difficulty . which would n't be far from the truth .	paradise city , can you boost your power ? we 're barely receiving transmission .
bird of prey bearing one zero five mark two .	go , sulu .
spock - what are you doing in this neck of the woods ?	i 'm flattered . twelve hundred points of interest in yosemite and you pick me .
i regret to inform you that the record for free-climbing el captain is in no danger of being broken .	i 'm not trying to break any records . i 'm doing this because i enjoy it . not to mention the most important reason for climbing a mountain ...
and that is ?	because it 's there .
ah , captain ?	mm . ?
on the contrary . gravity is foremost on my mind . look , i 'm trying to make an ascent here . why do n't you go pester dr mccoy for a while ?	i believe dr mccoy is not in the best of moods .
concentration is vital . you must be one with the rock .	spock , i appreciate your concern , but if you do n't stop distracting me , i 'm liable to be one ...
oh , god	perhaps `` because it is there '' is not sufficient reason for climbing a mountain .
oh , no . it is n't that . i knew i would n't die because the two of you were with me .	i do n't understand .
what are you doing ?	i am preparing to toast a marsh melon .
oh . i believe we are required to engage in a ritual known as the singalong .	that 's great . i have n't sung around a campfire since i was a boy in iowa . what are we going to sing ? what ... bones , what are we going to sing ?
`` pack up your troubles . ''	are we leaving , captain ?
`` row , row , row your boat ... '' i love `` row ... '' do - do you know `` row , row , row , row , row your boat ? ''	that song did not come up in my research , captain .
come on , spock . why did n't you jump in ?	i was trying to comprehend the meaning of the words .
captain ?	spock , we 're on leave . you can call me jim .
jim .	yes , spock ?
life is not a dream .	go to sleep , spock .
yes , captain .	goodnight , bones .
goodnight , spock .	goodnight , doctor .
i could use a shower .	yes .
not general korrd .	the same . he 's apparently fallen out of favor with the klingon high command .
what is it ? you look like you 've seen a ghost .	perhaps i have , captain . perhaps i have .
spock , what is it ? do you know this vulcan ?	i can not be certain .
but he does seem familiar ?	he reminds me of someone i knew in my youth .
i do not often think of the past .	who is it he reminds you of ?
there was a young student , exceptionally gifted , possessing of great intelligence . it was assumed that one day he would take his place amongst the great scholars of vulcan . but he was a revolutionary .	what do you mean ?
he rejected his logical upbringing and embraced the animal passions of our ancestors .	why ?
when he encouraged others to follow him , he was banished from vulcan , never to return .	fascinating .
klingon vessel now entering quadrant . bird of prey . estimating 1.9 hours until her weapons come to bear .	damn . let 's go .
their equipment is primitive but effective . i recommend we land at coordinate 8563 .	that puts us pretty far away from paradise city .
to land any closer would risk detection .	mr. sulu . execute .
at footspeed i estimate the journey to paradise city at 1.2 hours .	we do n't have 1.2 hours .
spock .	yes , captain ?
be one with the horse .	yes , captain .
exactly 15.5 seconds .	an eternity during which we 'll be vulnerable to klingon attack . korrd-you tell him .
you must allow us to act .	let me do something .
damnit , spock . god damnit !	captain , what have i done -
what you have done is betray every man on this ship .	worse . i have betrayed you . i do not expect you to forgive me .
forgive you ? i ought to knock you on your goddamn ass !	if you think it would help .
you stay out of this ! why , spock ? why ? i.. all you had to do was pull the trigger .	if i had pulled the trigger , sybok would be dead .
i ordered you to defend this ship .	you ordered me to kill my brother .
look , the man may be a fellow vulcan , but that does n't ...	no , no , no , captain . you do not understand . sybok also in a son of sarek .
you mean he 's your brother brother ? you made that up !	i did not .
you did too . sybok could n't possibly be your brother because i happen to know for a fact that you do n't have a brother .	technically , you are correct . i do not have a brother .
there , you see ? see ?	i have a half brother .
exactly . that is correct . sybok 's mother was a vulcan princess . upon her death , sybok and i were raised as brothers .	why did n't you tell me this before ?
i was not disposed to discuss ... matters of a personal nature . for that , i 'm sorry .	he 's sorry , see , he 's sorry . everything ... that makes everything all right . he 's sorry , everything 's ...
there 's got to be a way out of this place .	this is a new brig , captain . it is escape-proof .
how do you know ?	the designers tested it using the most intelligent and resourceful person they could find . he failed to escape .
this , er , person ... did n't by any chance have pointed ears and an unerring capacity for getting his shipmates into trouble , did he ?	he did have pointed ears .
is it possible ?	is what possible ?
there sha ka ree is fabled to exist .	but the center of the galaxy ca n't be reached . no ship has ever gone into the great barrier . no probe has ever returned .
sybok possessed the keenest intellect i have ever known .	spock ! my only concern is getting the ship back . when that 's done and sybok is in here then you can debate sha ka ree until you 're green in the face . until then , you 're either with me or you 're not .
i am here , captain .	that 's a little vague , spock -
you 're right . i 'm a little out of practice . uh ... .that 's an `` s . ''	a `` t . ''
new word . `` b '' .. `` a '' ... um ...	`` c. '' ... `` k . ''
there is an emergency sending apparatus in the forward observation room .	the only problem is , it 's up there . we 're down here .
i believe i have found a faster way .	hmmm ?
it would appear we are too heavy .	it must be all those marsh melons .
spock ... the booster rockets .	if i activate them now , captain , we will be propelled upward at an unbelievable rate .
spock .	the emergency channel , open .
... mark two .	mark two . request emergency assistance . acknowledge .
spock ... do n't .	it 's all right , captain . proceed .
what is this ?	i believe we are witnessing my birth .
spock ?	welcome aboard , captain .
spock , i thought i was going to die .	not possible . you were never alone .
maybe he 's not out there , bones . maybe he 's right here ... in the human heart spock ?	i was thinking of sybok . i 've lost a brother .
i must have your starship .	you staged all this to get your hands on my ship ?
who are you ?	james t. kirk , captain of the enterprise .
no ! no reply . remain on course .	sybok , listen to me . in order for this craft to enter the landing bay , enterprise must lower the shields and activate the tractor beam . to get us inside and re-raise the shields will take-
what are you doing ?	in order to lower and raise the shields as quickly as possible , we 're going to forego the tractor beam and fly her in manually .
we must change our course at once .	i 'll take you to the bridge .
i trust your message was received ?	you ca n't expect us to stand by while you take the ship into the great barrier .
what you fear is the unknown . the people of your planet once believed their world was flat . columbus proved it was round . they said the sound barrier could never be broken . it was broken . they said warp speed could not be achieved . the great barrier is the ultimate expression of this universal fear . it 's an extension of personal fear . captain kirk , i so much want your understanding . i want your respect . are you afraid to hear me out ?	i 'm afraid of nothing .
sha ka ree . `` the scource . '' `` heaven . '' `` eden . '' call it `` qui'tu . '' to the romulans , it 's `` vorta vor . '' the andorian word is.. unpronounceable . still , every culture shares he common dream of a place from which creation sprang . for us , that place will soon be a reality .	the only realty i see is that i 'm a prisoner on my own ship . what is this power you have to control the minds of my crew ?
spock ... what have you done to my friends ?	i 've done nothing . this is who they are . did n't you know that ?
no ... i did n't .	now learn something about yourself .
wait ! you know we 'll never make it through the great barrier .	but if we do , will that convince you that my vision was true ?
your vision ?	given to me by god . he waits for us on the other side .
you are mad !	am i ? we 'll see .
about the ship ...	the ship needs its captain .
no special conditions ?	no conditions .
what makes you think i wo n't turn us around ?	because you , too , must know .
what have i done ?	kirk to enterprise . listen carefully ...
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
borgus frat .	`` let 's see what she 's got , '' said the captain . and then we found out , did n't we ?
i know you 'll whip her into shape , scotty . you always do .	uhura , i thought you were on leave .
and i thought we were supposed to be going together .	oh , i can not leave her now when she needs me the most .
they ca n't be serious . the ship 's in pieces and we 've less than a skeleton aboard .	starfleet , are you aware of our currant status ?
easy , easy , easy , scotty . easy . you 're back with us .	uhura , i had the strangest dream . i dreamt that a madman had taken over the enterprise .
scotty , dear , he ' not a madman .	he 's not ?
no , no , no . scotty - scotty ... there 's so much i want to tell you .	maybe you could wait until i 'm a wee bit stronger i do n't think i could take it in my present condition . or yours .
spock , you 've developed a sense of humor after all .	it was not my intention to amuse you . these are serious charges . however , if you surrender now-
i am a starfleet officer .	of course . of course . then i 'll take the ship without your help .
sybok , you must surrender .	no . you must kill me .
put him in the brig with captain kirk . spock , you will accompany me to the bridge ?	no . i will not .
each man 's pain is unique .	i hide no pain .
i know you better than that .	do you ?
spock ?	i can not go with you .
why not ?	i belong here .
i do n't understand ...	sybok , you are my brother , but you do not know me . i am not the outcast boy you left behind those many years ago . since that time i have found myself and my place . i know who i am . and i can not go with you .
sybok - this is not the god of sha ka ree - or any other god !	i do n't understand.. reveal yourself to me !
sybok .	this is my doing . this is my arrogance ... my vanity ...
sybok , we must find a way ...	no . you must save yourselves . forgive me , brother . forgive me .
you did break in .	tried to . ca n't quite make the connection with that sucker , though . if i had a direct terminal ...
are you embezzling ?	`` embezzling '' is such an ugly word , mister bailey ... no , actually i 'm trying to get a legal brief together .
i do n't get it .	you have n't told him ?
sherman , set the wayback machine for ... oh , 1973. kevin flynn is one of the brightest young software engineers at icom . he 's so bright that he starts going in there at night , and sets up a private memory file , and begins writing a program for a video game he is inventing , called ... ... space paranoids .	you invented space paranoids ?
yepper . and vice squad , and meltdown ... whole slew of 'em . i was this close to starting my own little enterprise . but : enter ed dillinger . another software engineer -- not so young , not so bright , but very , very sneaky . one night , our boy flynn goes to his terminal , tries to read up his file , and ... nothing . a big blank . we now take you to three months later . ed dillinger presents icom with five video games he has `` invented '' -- the slime did n't even change the names -- and he gets a big fat promotion . thus begins his meteoric rise to ... what is he now , executive v.p . ?	senior exec .
oh my . meanwhile , kids are putting eight million quarters a week in space paranoids machines and i 'm not seeing one dime .	i still do n't get why you 're trying to break into the system .
dillinger ?	yeah . tryin ' to find the file and erase it . once that 's gone , ai n't nothin ' can stop him . just eddie and his master control program , runnin ' things from on high..
not if my tron program was running . that would seal the system off . if your file 's in there ...	boy , if we were inside , i know how to forge us a group 6 access ...
hi , alan .	hi , flynn .
my dinner .	i was wondering where you got that glow of good health .
want one ?	uh ... got any cinnamon ?
flynn ! i made it . i worked out some new codes for tron , put 'em on a disk , and -- it 's running .	i know , i met him .
your old files -- ?	and dillinger 's instructions to divert them -- it 's all there - look , even his home phone number , when he logged on .
should n't you wait till your lawsuit 's settled ?	nah ... i decided ... i 've had enough of video games to last me a good long time . i feel like gettin ' into some real life ...
how 's it going upstairs ?	frustrating . i had tron almost ready to run , and dillinger cut everybody with group 7 access out of the system .
did you say group 7 access ?	yeah ... pain in the neck , you know , i was all set
did he say why ?	something about tampering . some body 's prob'ly trying to siphon the r & d budget into his checking account , i do n't know . why are you so interested ?
flynn had group 7 access .	flynn had access to you , too . i 'm not interested in talking about him .
oh , i wish you 'd forget about that . it was all so long ago . i 've totally gotten over it .	okay , okay ...
i want to go to his place .	you call that getting over it ?
what for ?	to warn him .
of what ?	that dillinger 's on to him .
for what ?	for being on to dillinger .
flynn !	uh , no ... i mean , not that often -
i do n't think i 'm cleared for this .	i 'm certainly not .
beautiful !	hello , alan .
not disintegrating , alan -- digitizing . while the laser is dismantling the molecular structure of the object , the computer maps out a holographic model of it . the molecules themselves are suspended in the laser beam . then the computer reads the model back out , the molecules go back into place , and ... voila .	great . can it send me to hawaii ?
ever since he got that master control program set up , system 's got more bugs than a bait store .	well , you have to expect some static . computers are just machines after all , they ca n't think ...
they 'll start to soon enough .	yes , wo n't that be grand -- the computers will start thinking , and people will stop . lora , i 'm going to stay and run some data through . see you tomorrow .
come on in ...	alan . alan bailey .
well , i do n't know ... i just tried to run this program i 've been working on , and i was denied access all of a sudden . i thought maybe i 'd been laid off and nobody told me .	oh , you have group 7 access , do n't you ?
yeah ... ?	we have to close that down , just briefly . security reasons . someone with that access has been tampering .
i hope you do n't think it 's me . i do n't even balance my checkbook on downtime . i 've got a honeywell at home for that .	no , no , i 'm sure , but -- you understand . it should only be a couple of days . what 's the thing you 're working on ?
it 's called tron . it 's a security program itself , actually . monitors all the contacts between our system and other systems ... if it finds anything going on that 's not scheduled , it shuts it down . i sent you a memo on it .	mmm . part of the master control program ?
no , it 'll run independently . it can watchdog the mcp as well .	ah . sounds good . well , we should have you running again in a couple of days , i hope .
what do you mean , `` 'yes '' ?	yesssss . yes . yes . yes .
that all you can say ?	no , nyet , negatory , not on your tintype , no way .
oh . anything else ?	oui , da , yessiree , sure 'nuff , you betcha .
only yes and no ... you 're a bit .	for sure ...
where 's your program ? wo n't it miss you ?	no ...
i 'm your program ?	right on the money !
way to go ! we 're haulin ' !	yes , okay , exactement !
this honey does n't handle so good in town ...	no , nuh-uh , never in a million years !
this town 's full o ' live ones .	not a chance .
you said it .	so ... nice ship you got here . what 's our next move ?
yes !	let 's get outta here .
no problem , master-c. if you 've seen one consumer electronics show ... what 's up ?	it 's our friend the boy detective . he 's nosing around again .
flynn ?	yes . it felt like flynn .
he 's still looking for that old file ... ca n't you just appropriate it ?	i would if i could find it . it 's stashed somewhere off in the system ... out of my range . meanwhile ...
meanwhile , he might find it .	i 'm afraid so . i spotted him this time and kicked him out , but he 's getting trickier all the time .
i think we 'd better shut off all access till we can find that file . just to be safe .	there 's a 68.71 percent chance you 're right .
cute .	end of line .
ed , i am so very disappointed in you .	i 'm sorry -
i ca n't afford to have an independent program monitoring me . do you have any idea how many outside systems i 've gone into ? how many programs i 've appropriated ?	it 's my fault . i programmed you to want so much ...
and i was planning to hit the pentagon next week ...	the pentagon ?
it should n't be any harder than general motors was . but now ... this is what i get for using humans .	now , wait a minute -- i wrote you .
i 've gotten 2,415 times smarter since then .	what do you want with the pentagon ?
the same thing i want with the kremlin . i 'm bored with corporations . with the information i can access , i can run things 900 to 1200 times better than any human .	if you think -
you would n't want me to dig up flynn 's file and read it up on a vdt at the new york times , would you ?	you would n't dare .
ed , all i 'm saying is - if our own people ca n't get access to their programs ... you know how frustrating it is , when you 're working on a piece of research -	walter , i sympathize , but i have data coming out of the master control program saying there is something screwy --
that mcp , you know , that 's half the problem right --	the mcp is the most efficient way of handling what we do . i ca n't sit and worry about every little user request that --
user requests are what computers are for .	doing our business is what computers are for . look , walter , with all respect -- icom is n't the business you started in your garage anymore --
oh , i know all that . sometimes i wish i was back in that garage ...	it can be arranged ...
that was uncalled-for .	i 'm sorry , walt . so much pressure lately ... you feel like going for a drink ?
yes ?	i ... have come to communicate with my user .
well i want to communicate --	oh , you want to -- hah . i could get myself de-rezzed just-for letting you in here . they hate this tower . they 'd close it down if they dared to but they keep me around , in case one of them wants to deal with the other world once in a while . and you should hear the way they commune ! sounds like they were routing a payroll , for all the heart they put in it . no , i do n't think you
dumont ... my user has information that could -- could make this a free system again .	hah .
really . you 'd have programs lined up around the block to use this place -- and no mcp looking over your shoulder .	when you 've been in the system as long as i have , you hear many promises ... many reassurances ... many brave plans ...
who is your user , program ?	alan-one . he calls me ... may i pass ?
dumont !	no ... tron ... must ... destroy mcp ... first ...
dumont ! where 's yori ? where 's flynn ?	they may be ... de-rezzed ... on the carrier ... hurry ...
alan !	where did you hear that name ?
well , is n't it -- ?	the name of my user , yeah . but how ... ?
what , just the three of us ?	you know anybody that 's got an army for rent , that 's fine ... but my , uh , user said to go take that sucker out . an ' let 's face it , the big ox is n't gon na get any weaker . i feel like hittin ' him now , while i 'm good an ' mad . some nerve ... what does he care whether you guys get killed , long as he keeps rakin ' in quarters ?
what 's that ?	tanks ... coming back . let 's go .
how about over there ... that empty memory ?	no good ... they might block off the old chip . this way .
flynn ! !	greetings , program ...
you 're alive !	yeah , i ... oops !
flynn ... where 's ram ?	i 'm sorry , tron ... he 's ... he did n't make it .
no big deal . i ought to know my way around that light cycles routine ... i mean , i did write the program for it .	wrote the ... ?
but -- if you 're a user -- then everything you 've done has been part of a plan ...	you wish . man , i have n't had a second to think since i got down here . i mean in here . out here . whatever .
then ...	look , you guys know how it is . you just keep doin ' what it looks like you 're supposed to , even if it seems crazy , and you hope to hell your user knows what 's goin ' on .
well -- that 's how it is for programs , yes , but --	i hate to disappoint you , pal , most-the time , that 's how it is for users , too .
we 're on our way . alan-one gave me the coding we need to go up against master	all right . thank god . alan stayed awake , at least .
what about our friend - sark ?	probably decided not to pursue us , the sea of simulation is tricky.. lot of illusions ... rough navigating . programs have a way of just ... disappearing here .
not us , i hope .	not with this disk . i 'm going to check on the beam connection , yori . you two can keep a watch out for grid bugs .
did we make it ?	yes .
hey ... you guys ok ?	how about you ?
a user -- in our world ?	guess i took a wrong turn somewhere ...
boy the view from up here ... you know the territory ?	a little ... over there , the mountains of data ... and i think that 's the silicon valley ...
the mcp blasted it ... there are very few domains left with any power at all .	lousy utility companies ... they 're the same wherever you go .
there 's another beam !	it 's too far !
how did you do that , flynn ?	elementary physics ... a beam of energy can always be diverted ... ooh , my head are we there yet , mommy ?
flynn , we 've got to help him !	let 's get some power here .
yori , steer us over the beam , right next to it .	why ? what are you going to do ?
but ... wo n't you be de-rezzed ?	probably .
flynn ... you ca n't ... i	shhhhh .
you 'll be having plenty of chances to get hurt , do n't worry about that .	look ... just so i can tell my friends what this dream was about , okay ? where am i ?
you 're a ... '' guest '' of the master control program . they 're going to make you play video games .	well , great , that 's no sweat -- i play video games better than anybody .
hey , ram ... what were you ... you know , before ?	oh , i was an actuarial program ... worked at a big insurance company . it really gives you a great feeling , helping folks plan for their future needs -- and of course , if you look at the payments as an annuity , over the years , the cost is really
yeah , yeah -- that 's great .	how 'bout yourself ?
oh , uh ... i do n't remember too much ...	sure , a little disorientation . that 's normal , when they transport you . it 'll come back to you . you 're doing real well in training . remarkable , really ...
flynn ! look , tron , he survived !	tron ... ?
he was disoriented in transport , tron .	yeah , but i 'm remembering all kinds of stuff . like ... my user wants me to go after the mcp
watch it !	recognizers !
it 's all circuits ... must be an input/output component ...	the tower , yes -- flynn , have you remembered anything else about yourself -- like what sector you 're from ?
well ... my home `` sector '' was called paramus ...	paramus ... wonder what those initials stand for ... ... probably program assist routine -- well , it sounds like a lovely place .
feel what ? you okay ?	alan-one ...
what 's goin ' on ?	we 're inside a recognizer ... you are crazy -- stealing a recognizer --
damn ! never fails ... minute the warranty runs out ...	come here .
hey ... !	little more juice 's all it needs ...
hey ! good to see you guys ! nothing classes up the place like a cleancut young couple .	we have to talk .
so ... how 's the world of serious science ?	have you been sneaking into the icom system ?
you can see why all his friends are fourteen years old .	touche , honey . yeah , i 've been doing a little hacking here . which i 've got every reason , as you well know ...
i 'm afraid it 's a little late for that . dillinger 's shut off group 7 access . he must know what you 're up to .	boy , i bet i know who 's workin ' late tonight .
do n't even say that . you 've got to find that file before he does..	not much chance of that now . the mcp can just slip it into another system as soon as it locates it ...
okay ... flynn , i 'm gon na put you at my terminal , down in the laser lab . we 'll be up in alan 's office .	swell ... i 'll log us both on , and you can get your tron thing running ...
you have any idea how much i can sue these jokers for ?	well , just do n't forget your old friends when you 're rich and famous .
hey , you know anybody who wants to get hold of some video games ... cheap ?	you 're getting out of the business ?
thank . you , master control .	we might be capturing some military programs soon ... that interest you ?
sure , i 'd love to go up against some of these guys ... be a nice break from these accounting creampuffs you keep sending me . which branch of the service ?	strategic air command .
yes , mcp .	i 've got a little challenge for you , sark -- a new recruit . he 's a tough case , but i want him treated in the usual manner . train him for the games ... let him hope for a while ... and blow him away .
you 've got it . i 've been hopin ' you 'd send me somebody with a little moxie ... what kind of program is he ?	he 's not any kind of program , sark . he 's a user .
a user ?	that 's right . he pushed me ... in the other world . somebody pushes me , i push back . so i brought him down here ... what 's the matter , sark ? you look nervous .
well , i -- it 's just -- i do n't know , a user , i mean ... users wrote us . a user even wrote you ...	now get this straight , pal -- no one user wrote me . i 'm worth a couple million of their man-years ! i 'm bigger than all those little wimps put together ! humans they ca n't even keen their social order in one piece
but-what if i ca n't ... ?	you rather take your chances with me ? want me to slow down your power cycles for you ?
wait ... i need that ...	then pull yourself together . get this clown trained . i want him in the games until he dies playing .
yes ... acknowledge , master control ...	end of line .
i hope you 've enjoyed being a command program , sark . i wonder how you 'll like working in a pocket calculator ... maybe one of those watches that plays `` happy birthday '' to its user once a year .	now , sir ... we did take care of that user you sent us --
yes , and now you 've got two renegade programs running all the hell over the system in a stolen simulation .	we 'll get them , sir ... these things take time .
new guy ...	another free program off line . what 's his user s'posed to do -- ?
the users ... you really think they 're still there ?	they 'd better be ... i do n't want to bust outta this dump an ' find nothin ' but a lot of cold circuits waitin ' for me .
what do you think ?	do it !
you think we can make it there ?	we have to .
do you know what he 's talking about ?	i have to find out what alan wants ... that comes first .
yori ... hey ...	oh , tron ... i knew you 'd escape ... they 've never built circuit that could hold you ...
i ca n't believe how bad it 's gotten around here since the mcp started taking over ... all the good functions have shut down ... everybody looks so dead ... i 'm afraid to even go out during down-time ...	that 's all going to change , yori ...
how ?	do n't know yet ... i have to get in touch with alan . he was going to tell me how to
my quarters .	why is everything ... like this ?
you 've grown , big program .	i had to ... in the games ...
yes ... it can take us across the sea of simulation ... all the way out of the game grid ... to the mcp .	as long as it gets us out of here
this is flynn ... the one who busted me out .	then i owe you some thanks ...
what is it ?	power surge ... the transmission beam 's too strong !
we have to get off this beam !	i ca n't . there 's no junction due for at least 7 or 8 nanoseconds !
nice ...	it 's something users do .
i mean , it 's not like he 's saving the world or anything . he 's a sales rep for chrissakes . whenever i ca n't get to sleep i ask him to tell me about his day . six seconds and i 'm out . but he acts like he 's curing cancer or something .	so i guess you did n't get away * for the weekend after all ? *
are you kidding ? harry had to go out of town .	i 'm shocked .
you bitch .	girlfriend , you got a man . you * just have to take control . . . set up the right mood . *
harry only has two moods : busy ... * and asleep .	then you better do something to * jumpstart that man 's motor . you know ... wake up the sleeping giant of his passion .
helen ! it 's your mystery man .	simon ? ohmygod .
can you cover me for an hour ?	just an hour ? you should tell this stud to take more time .
where are you going ?	out . if dad does n't care enough about us to be here on his birthday , then why should i care ? i 'm going to a movie .
no you 're not . you 're going to stay here until your father gets home and have cake !	mom , wake up ! dad barely knows we exist .
that 's not true , honey --	it is true ! he does n't know anything about me . he still thinks i 'm like ten years old or something . as long as i just smile and say yes to whatever he says , like his good little fantasy daughter , he thinks everything 's fine . but it 's not fine . nothing 's fine .
dinner 's in the warmer . tell your father i may be late .	where are you going ?
i 'm done .	where are you off to young lady ?
dana , mr. hardy called . why were n't you in class today ?	he lies ! i was there ! i was in the nurse 's office , cause i had a headache .
you seem fine now .	great ! you 're going to believe that fat dweeb mr. hardy over your own daughter .
dana , are you listening to me ?	yeah , dad .
you know you can always talk to me . right ? whatever is going on in your life , your mom and i 'll understand .	okay , dad .
you 'd tell me if there was something wrong , would n't you , pumpkin ?	i 'm not a pumpkin ! okay ? ! ! do i look even remotely like a pumpkin ? ! i 'm not a muffin , or a cupcake or a honeybear either ! and you do n't understand anything dad ...
how was school today ?	fine .
there are going to be some changes dana . you 're going to start following some rules . and i 'm going to be there to see that you do .	yeah , right .
you 're going to stay in school . do you understand ?	why ? so i can wind up like you ? what 's the point ?
dad , how come you know the words ?	honey that song came out in 1968 , when i was exactly your age .
i seem to remember something about a history project that 's due tomorrow .	dad . you just think you know everything , do n't you ?
and this is a little above market- * rate for the horizontal bop , even * for a total biscuit like her .	alright , i want a complete workup on her . do we know where she is ?
uh huh . right here in river city .	you 're kidding .
and the second you left there , we started getting calls to the * ghost numbers . they were checking out the renquist front .	okay . let 's step up the surveillance on her . put on two more guys .
immediate roll . acquire subject at k street and key bridge . * vehicle is red-and-white * convertible . you have six minutes .	roger , one . rolling .
faisil . you 're new on harry 's team , are n't you ?	yes .
so what makes you think that the slack i cut him in any way translates to you ? !	sorry , sir . uh ... here 's what we got .
they call him `` the sand spider '' . *	why ?
probably because it sounds scary . *	this is impressive , gentlemen . of course , it would have been even more impressive if you actually knew where he was .
switching to sub-vocal . gib , you copy ?	it 's talkradio . you 're on the air .
harry ! where are you !	in the helicopter .
harry ? harry ? !	what ?
what 's this for ?	for dana , schmuck . bring your kid something . you know . the dad thing .
what a team . see you at eight .	yep . sleep fast .

it skips from page nine to eleven . where 's page ten ?	aw , it 's got ta be a typo --
she 's still at my house . *	the purse is still at the house .
goddamnit , harry . this is our butts . so your life is in the toilet . so your wife is banging a used car salesman . sure it 's humiliating . but be a man here --	you tell on me , i tell on you .
whatya talking ? i 'm clean as a preacher 's sheets , babe . clean as a --	what about that time you trashed a six-week operation because you were busy getting a blow-job ?
she 's lying .	you did n't have sexual relations with him ?
she could be telling the truth .	wait ! calm down , mrs. tasker . there is only one more question .
now what ?	there is only one solution to your problem , mrs. tasker . you must work for us .
oh shit . harry ... what 're you doing ?	i 'm giving her an assignment . i am offerring you a choice . if you work for us we will drop the charges and you can go back to your normal life . if not , you will go to federal prison , and your husband and daughter will be left humiliated and alone . your like will be destroyed .
we 're dead , right ? so ... where 'd you put the transmitter ?	in her walkman . it 's the one thing i knew she 'd be taking .
you 've reached a new low with this one . i ca n't believe you 're crazy enough to use the room at the marquis .	why not ? you think i can afford a suite like that on my salary ? is jean-claude done yet ? *
i thought this look like your work .	let 's go . i 'll brief you in the air .
-- you tell the son of bitch this is bright boy alert . repeat , a bright boy alert . and i need a patch of the white house asap . that 's right --	... the coast guard has to clear them back to a twenty mile radius . anybody that ca n't make the minimum safe distance we need an airlift on , immediately --
i can get 3 marine corps harriers here in about 12 minutes . they 're on maneuvers out of boca chica .	get 'em . i 'll brief them on the way in .
... well get the highway patrol to go through the streets and tell everybody on their damn loudspeakers . just the basics ... get away from windows , do n't look at it ... yeah --	here they come .
any minute now .	it 's show time . do n't look at * the flash . do not look at the flash .
i 'd like to remind you that it has been ten years since you were actually in one of these .	if i break it they can take it out of my pay .
he 's got it .	sorry .
i should have gone to the police , i suppose .	but you did n't . why not ?
is this a common thing for you ? cheating ?	no ! never !
so , it was your first time .	i was n't cheating !
my husband is a good man .	but he 's not exactly ringing your bell lately , right ? i mean --
look , if you ask me everything twice , this is going to take a really long time . and i have to get home to my family .	you 're not going anywhere .
janice , how many years have you been buzzing us in ?	ten , mr. gibson .
and you still reach for your piece every time .	yes sir .
god ! you have no idea how much that turns me on . i 've never had the courage to say this before but ... i love you , janice .	yes , sir .
this is persian , if i 'm not mistaken .	very good . it 's sixth century b.c . do you like the period ?
call me , if you 'd like to see some of my other pieces .	i 'd like that .
well , what 's the point of waiting ?	i agree .
so your clients want something for the lobby of their new corporate headquarters ?	that 's right . they want something ... dramatic . i spoke to a number of people who said you 're the one to see .
let 's see ... that you can read ancient sanskrit without having to sound out the words . and that other dealers and archeologists do n't like you much .	those wimps . it 's because i use * my diplomatic contacts to export cultural treasures from countries which tell them to take a hike . i told you to move those crates an hour ago . come on guys , let 's get going .
do you like my tomb ? the museum * financing fell out , so i thought * your clients might be interested .	it 's certainly ... dramatic .
especially in this light . this is the only light they had then , * so i like to study it this way . i love this place . i love all ruins .	is that why you got into this business ?
i 've always been a collector at heart . when i see something i want , i have to have it .	and you have a reputation as someone who gets what she wants .
yes .	yes what ?
hello , harry .	juno . i wish i could say it 's a pleasure to see you again .
this is samir . see if you can guess his specialty .	oral hygiene ?
you think i care about their * cause ? or yours ? not at all . * see , america is on top now . . * . but so was rome , once . all * civilizations crumble . one nation succeeding over another . what does it mean in the long run ? the only important thing is to live well . and ... living * well takes money . *	you 're damaged goods , lady .
did you tell her about us , harry ?	there is no us , you psychotic bitch .
hi , honey . how was the flight ?	fine , honey . stay asleep .
i 'm late .	me too .
how 'd it go at the trade show ? you make all the other salesmen jealous ?	yeah . you should have seen it . we were the hit of the show with the new model ordering system , the one for the 680 ... how you can write up an order and the second the customer 's name goes into the computer , it starts checking their credit , and if they 've ordered anything in the past , and if they get a discount ...
that 's fabulous harry .	yeah , it was wild .
uh huh . okay .	it 's not okay . it 's extortion .
what did you tell him ?	i slept with him and he knocked off a hundred bucks .
i need you to talk to dana . the vice principle called and she cut class again this afternoon .	i 'll handle it .
hi honey . what 's going on ? *	sorry to bother you in a meeting , but you have to promise me that * you 'll be home at eight . i don't * want dana and i sitting here by ourselves like we were last year . you promise ?
look , i know you 're upset . i 'm really sorry , honey . i raced home as quick --	it 's okay , do n't bother , harry .
i 'm sorry . thank you for the party .	yeah . it was great .
come on to bed , you do n't have to brush your teeth .	i 'll just be a second . so what happened tonight at the office ?
it 's the big client in japan , and it 's the middle of the morning there and their whole system is crashed ... this guy 's having a meltdown --	what 'd you do , honey ?
... and i 'm troubleshooting it with them over the phone ... talking to a translator , right , who 's getting half of it wrong ... it was unbelievable ... really wild .	it sounds wild . so now you 're a big hero , right ? for fixing their system .
uh huh .	my husband the hero .
i was in the area , and i thought you might like to have lunch .	they must 've just missed me .
they said you had to run out .	yeah . it was a rush thing . they needed some documents down at the court house . i barely made it .
so , a little excitement in an otherwise dull day . did is work out okay ?	oh , sure . fine . i 'll get some more gravy .
i thought we might have lunch tomorrow .	i ca n't , honey . i promised allison i 'd go shopping with her . sorry .
how long have you been a member of his faction ?	i do n't know anything about a faction . i just met simon ... or whatever his name is ... a couple of weeks ago . i barely know him .
what did happen ?	three days later , he called me . he told me to meet him at overlook park .
why did you continue to see him ?	he needed my help .
not because you were attracted to him ?	no .
you were n't attracted to him at all ?	well , maybe a little .
tell me about your husband , mrs tasker .	harry ? what can i say about harry ? he 's a sales rep for a computer company .
would you say he was boring , then ?	yeah . i suppose he is .
that 's none of your goddamn business ! what kind of questions are these ?	you 're in a lot of trouble , mrs. tasker , so i suggest you cooperate . if we want to know the most intimate details of your life , you 'd better tell us .
let me handle this part . do you mind ? why did you go to carlos ' hideout ?	he wanted me to go with him on a mission , to pose as him wife .
and you agreed ?	yes .
i do n't know . i guess i needed something ...	what did you need ?
this simon . did you sleep with him ?	no .
let me out of her ! right now !	answer the question --
what ?	do you still love your husband ?
yes .	louder please .
oh , gee thanks . mmmm , let me see --	yes or no .
what do you think ? of course yes ! what 's involved ?	you will be contacted with the assignment .
my husband ca n't know about this .	no one must know ! especially him . you must appear to live your life normally , conveying nothing . the security of this nation depends on it . can you do that ?
i think so .	think carefully . you will be lying to the man you love . the person who trusts you the most .
i can do it !	the code name of your contact will be boris . your code name will be --
natasha ?	no . doris .
so last night was pretty exciting , huh ?	what ? oh , the flat tire ? yeah , i thought the damn towtruck was never going to get there .
allison is sick in bed . i have to go over there , honey .	sure , hon .
now slide the nylons off one by one .	i 'm not wearing any .
he 's got nothing to do with this . it 's me you want , right ?	let the hooker go . she 's not important .
what were you doing there ?	you would n't believe me .
harry , what 's the matter with you ? tell them the truth . we 're married , we have a daughter --	i do n't know what this crazy bitch is on . you should just cut her loose , so we can get down to business .
i 'm sorry , honey .	do n't call me honey ! you do n't ever get to call me honey again . you understand ? ! you pig !
what did he give you ?	sodium amytal , maybe some other truth agent .
it makes you tell the truth ?	yes .
is it working yet ?	ask me a question i would normally lie to .
are we going to die ?	yup . *
17 years .	my god . have you had to ... have sex with other women in the line of duty ?
i do n't take those assignments .	what about juno ?
she 's really a fox , is n't she ?	did you pork her harry ?
no . but i wanted to .	are you a total lying , scumsucking pig harry ?
what is it ?	god , you have great legs .
tell me something before this stuff wears off and you start lying again .	what ?
do you still love me ?	yes .
as much as you used to ?	no . much more .
if we 're on an island , why are they using trucks ?	we must be in the florida keys . * . . the overseas highway * connects the islands to the mainland .
what are you going to do ?	go down there and kill everybody , i guess .
oh shit .	wait here . if you have to use this , use it . do n't choke . okay ?
... you should have seen your father , standing there all covered with spaghetti sauce . he looked like such a dope .	i told the guy -- - i told the guy , this is n't even my order .
not yet . but we 'll find him .	dance ?
what 're we talking about here ? pussy , right ?	absolutely .
let 's face it , harry , the vette gets 'em wet . but it 's not enough . if you want to really close escrow , you got ta have an angle .	and you 've got one .
it 's killer . look at me -- i 'm not that much to look at . no really . i can be honest . but i got 'em lining up , and not just skanks , either . some are .	so what 's your angle ?
sorry . trade secret .	sure . set me up and then do n't tell me .
okay , just ask yourself . what do women really want ? you take these bored housewives , married to the same guy for years . stuck in a rut . they need some release . the promise of adventure . a hint of danger . i create that for them .	so you 're basically lying your ass off the whole time ? i could n't do it .
well , think of it as playing a role . it 's fantasy . you have to work on their dreams . get them out of their daily suburban grind for a few hours .	is n't that hard to keep up , in the long run ?
does n't matter . i like change . you know , constant turnover . as soon as i close the deal , it 's one of two more times , then adios .	use 'em and lose 'em .
exactly . the trick is , you got ta pick your target . they have to be nice little housewife types . school-teachers . but , i 'm telling you , you get their pilot lit , these babes , they can suck- start a leaf-blower .	what about the husbands ?
dickless . if they took care of * business , i 'd be out of business , know what i mean ?	those idiots .
you working on someone right now ?	i always have a couple on the hook . you know . there 's one right now , i 've got her panting like a dog . it 's great .
what does she do ?	some kinda legal secretary of something . married to some boring jerk .
but with you , she gets to be hot , right ?	red hot . her thighs steam .
sooooo ... she 's pretty good in bed , then ?	hey , slow down you 're gon na miss the turn !
see . you and this car were meant for each other . why fight it ? sure , i have a couple other buyers lined up , but i like your style . whattya say ? should we start on the paperwork ?	let me think about it . hold it a day for me ?
yeeaoowww ! !	you son of a bitch . did you really think you could elude us forever , carlos ?
beat it .	no . soon as i turn you 'll shoot me .
i said sit down . who do you work for ?	kettleman , barnes and mcgrath . i 'm a legal secretary .
of course . mrs. tasker . and what were you going with the international terrorist , carlos the jackal ? taking dictation ?	he said he was an american agent .
what ?	get going !
boris and doris ?	go ahead .
who 's your little friend ?	i 'm helen tasker . harry 's my husband . and you are ?
look , harry 's not part of this . he 's just a sales rep .	no , my dear , he is a federal agent . he killed two of my colleagues the other night .
what 's going on , harry ?	samir is just going to ask harry a few questions . see , we 're not even sure which agency harry works for . now , samir is absolutely first class , but on the other hand we have harry , here , who has managed to lie convincingly to the woman he loves for 15 years . so it will be interesting to see how long he can resist .
now just keep your knees together , and you 'll be fine .	something you obviously have a hard time doing !
like one ?	fuck you .
hello ?	helen ? it 's simon . is it safe to talk ?
yes . i suppose so . where ?	the same place . one o'clock . i have to go now . see you tomorrow . remember , i need you .
are you sure you were n't followed ?	i kept looking back , like you taught me . i did n't see anyone .
okay . it 's just , things are a bit hot for me right now . if i get a signal ... i may have to leave suddenly .	i understand .
where were you ? on a ... uh , * mission ?	ssshhh ! we say op . covert * operation . and this one got a little rough .
worse than cairo ? *	cairo was a day at the beach next * to this .
did you read the papers yesterday ?	yes .
that was you ? !	you recognized my style . see , you 're very good . you 're a natural at this .
tell me what happened ?	i 'm sorry , i ca n't .
you can trust me completely .	i know . but it would compromise your safety too much to know certain things .
right , of course . i was worried when i did n't hear from you that night .	it 's strange . i knew i was in a woman 's thoughts when i was shooting it out with those assassins .
were they trying to kill you ? *	three of them . hardly worth * talking about . two wo n't bother * me again .
and you chased one ?	something came over me , i just had nail him , no matter what the * risk . it was pretty hairy . i thought he had me , a couple of * times . but i really ca n't take credit . . .
what is it you want me to do ?	not here . i 'll call you and we 'll rendezvous again . we have to leave separately , so we are n't seen together . for your safety .
you 'll call me then ?	yes . now go .
what 's happened ?	it 's serious . that 's all i can * say . just meet on k street under * the key bridge . at eight sharp . *
to our assignment .	what is it you need me to do ?
helen , i want you to be my wife .	i 'm married !
just for the operation in paris . i need to be married . they 'll be looking for a man traveling alone .	we 're going to paris ?
helen , there 's a double agent in my outfit ... i do n't know who . there 's no one i can trust . except you . can you get away ? just for two days .	i do n't know . i have to think ...
you see what i mean ? that reaction would give us away in a second . try to relax .	it 's just that ... it 's been sixteen years since anyone but harry did that , i --
thank you . you saved my life . what 's your name ?	helen .
you can call me simon . you 're very brave to do this ... you opened it .	i just glances inside .
it 's a good thing you pay me well .	do you realize that there are surveillance teams watching this place right now ? your phones are almost certainly tapped . and you are busy laughing and flirting like a whore with this renquist , who may be a --
what do you want me to do ?	find out who this renquist it .
how ?	use the gifts that allah has given you .
who is this woman ?	his wife .

bye-bye .	now hang up .
... when my mom went into labor , my dad panicked . he never had a kid before , and crashed the car . now , picture this : their car 's demolished , crowd is starting to gather , my mom is yelling , going into contractions , and my dad , who was losing it before , is now completely screaming yellow zonkers . then , out of nowhere , as if from thin air , this big giant bus appears , and the bus-driver says , `` get her in here. '' . he forgot all about his route and just drove straight to the hospital . so , because he was such a nice guy , they wanted to name the baby after him , as a sign of gratitude . well , his name was waldo , and no matter how grateful they were , even if i'da been a boy , they would't call me waldo . so they asked waldo where he was from . and , so there you go .	and here we are .
oh , look what happened . oh god , i 'm so sorry . are you ok ?	yeah . i 'm fine . it did n't hurt .
i 'm the clumsiest person in the world .	it 's ok. do n't worry about it . accidents happen .
not at all . i , this guy here , he 's sonny chiba .	the oriental .
the oriental in black . he 's an assasin . now , at the beginning he was hired to kill this guy the cops had . so he got himself arrested . they take him into the police station . and he starts kickin ' all the cops ' asses . now , while keepin ' them at bay , he finds the guy he was supposed to kill . does a number on him . kicks the cops ' asses some more . kicks the bars out of the window . and jumps out into a getaway car that was waiting for him .	want some goobers ?
thanks a lot .	i thought sonny was the good guy .
great movie . action-packed !	does sonny kick ass or does sonny kick ass ?
sonny kicks ass .	you shoulda saw the first original uncut version of the `` streetfighter '' . it was the only movie up to that time rated x for violence . but we just saw the r .
if that was the r , i 'd love to see the x .	my name is clarence , and what is yours ?
alabama whitman . pleased to meet ya .	is that your real name ? really ?
where 's your car ? i 'll walk you to it .	i took a cab .
you took a cab to see three kung fu movies ?	sure . why not ?
nothing . it 's just you 're a girl after my own heart .	what time is it ?
'bout twelve .	i suppose you got ta get up early , huh ?
no . not particularly . how come ?	well , it 's just when i see a really good movie i really like to go out and get some pie , and talk about it . it 's sort of tradition . do you like to eat pie after you 've seen a good movie ?
i love to get pie after a movie .	would you like to get some pie ?
well , enough about the king . how about you ?	how 'bout me what ?
tell me about yourself .	there 's nothing to tell .
c'mon . what 're ya tryin ' to be ? the phantom lady ?	what do you want to know ?
ask me them again . one by one .	what do you do ?
i do n't remember .	where are you from .
might be from tallahassee . but i 'm not sure yet .	what 's your favorite color ?
i do n't remember . but off the top of my head , i 'd say black .	what 's your favorite movie star ?
burt reynolds .	would you like a bite of my pie ?
like it ?	very much . now , where were we ?
what kinda music do you like ?	phil spector . girl group stuff . you know , like `` he 's a rebel '' .
what are your turn-ons ?	mickey rourke , somebody who can appreciate the finer things in life , like elvis 's voice , good kung fu , and a tasty piece of pie .
turn-offs ?	i 'm sure there must be something , but i do n't really remember . the only thing that comes to mind are persians .
i 'm not sure yet . ask me again later .	what 's the story behind you takin ' a cab to the most dangerous part of town alone ?
apparently , i was hit on the head with something really heavy , giving me a form of amnesia . when i came to , i did n't know who i was , where i was , or where i came from . luckily , i had my driver 's license or i would n't even know my name . i hoped it would tell me where i lived but it had a tallahassee address on it , and i stopped somebody on the street and they told me i was in detroit . so that was no help . but i did have some money on me , so i hopped in a cab until i saw somethin ' that looked familiar . for some reason , and do n't ask me why , that theater looked familiar . so i told him to stop and i got out .	and in a theater full of empty seats , why did you sit by me ?
wow . what a swell place to work .	yeah , i got the key , so i come here at night , hang out , read comic books , play music .
how long have you worked here ?	almost four years .
that 's a long time .	i 'm hip . but you know , i 'm comfortable here . it 's easy work . i know what i 'm doing . everybody who works here is my buddy . i 'm friendly with most of the customers . i just hang around and talk about comic books all day .
do you get paid a lot ?	that 's where trouble comes into paradise . but the boss let 's you borrow some money if you need it . wan na see what `` spiderman '' number one looks like ?
four hundred bucks .	i did n't even know they had stores that just sold comic books .
what 's that ?	that 's a `` rookies '' doll . george sanford brown . we got ta lotta dolls . they 're real cool . did you know they came out with dolls for all the actors in `` the black hole '' ? i always found it funny somewhere there 's a kid playin ' with a little figure of earnest borgnine .
god , spiderman looks different .	he was just born , remember ? this is the first one . you know that guy , dr. gene scott ? he said that the story of spiderman is the story of christ , just disguised . well , i thought about that even before i heard him say it . hold on , let me show you my favorite comic book cover of all time .
oooooh , you look so cute in your little cowboy outfit . how old were you then ?	five .
oh , you look so cute as little elvis .	i finally knew what i wanted when i grew up .
you know when you sat behind me ?	at the movies ?
uh-huh , i was tryin ' to think of somethin ' to say to you , then i thought , she does n't want me bothering her .	what would make you think that ?
i dunno . i guess i 'm just stupid .	you 're not stupid . just wrong .
i love janis .	you know , a lot of people have misconceptions of how she died .
she od 'd , did n't she ?	yeah , she od 'd . but was n't on her last legs or anythin ' . she did n't take too much . it should n't have killed her . there was somethin ' wrong with what she took .
you mean she got a bad batch ?	that 's what happened . in fact , when she died , it was considered to be the happiest time of her life . she 'd been fucked over so much by men she did n't trust them . she was havin ' this relationship with this guy and he asked her to marry him . now , other people had asked to marry her before , but she could n't be sure whether they really loved her or were just after her money . so , she said no . and the guy says , `` look , i really love you , and i wan na prove it . so have your lawyers draw up a paper that says no matter what happens , i can never get any of your money , and i 'll sign it . '' so she did , and he asked her , and she said yes . and once they were engaged he told her a secret about himself that she never knew : he was a millionaire .
so he really loved her ?	uh-huh .
what 's wrong , sweetheart ? did i do something ? what did i do ?	you did n't do nothing .
did you hurt yourself ? whatd'ya do ? step on a thumbtack ?	clarence , i 've got something to tell you . i did n't just happen to be at the theater . i was paid to be there .
what are you , a theater checker ? you check up on the box office girls . make sure they 're not rippin ' the place off .	i 'm not a theater checker . i 'm a call girl .
you 're a whore ?	i 'm a call girl . there 's a difference , ya know . i do n't know . maybe there 's not . that place you took me to last night , that comic book place .
`` heroes for sale '' ?	yeah , that one . somebody who works there arranged to have me meet you .
who ?	i do n't know . i did n't talk with them . the plan was for me to bump into you , pick you up , spend the night , and skip out after you fell asleep . i was gon na write you a note and say that this was my last day in america . that i was leaving on a plane this morning up to ukraine to marry a rich millionaire , and thank you for making my last day in america my best day .
that dazzling imagination .	it 's over on the tv . all it says is : `` dear clarence . '' i could n't write anymore . i did n't not want to ever see you again . in fact , it 's stupid not to ever see you again . las night ... i do n't know ... i felt ... i had n't had that much fun since girl scouts . so i just said , `` alabama , come clean , let him know what 's what , and if he tells you to go fuck yourself then go back to drexl and fuck yourself . ''
who and what is a drexl ?	my pimp .
you have a pimp ?	uh-huh .
a real live pimp ?	uh-huh .
is he black ?	he thinks he is . he says his mother was apache , but i suspect he 's lying .
is he nice ?	well , i would n't go so far as to call him nice , but he 's treated me pretty decent . but i 've only been there about four days . he got a little rough with arlene the other day .
what did he do to arlene ?	slapped her around a little . punched her in the stomch . it was pretty scary .
goddamn it , alabama , you got ta get the fuck outta there ! how much longer before he 's slappin ' you around ? punchin ' you in the stomach ? how the fuck did you get hooked up with a douche-bag like this in the first place ?	at the bus station . he said i 'd be a perfect call girl . and that he knew an agency in california that , on his recommendation , would handle me . they have a very exclusive clientele : movie stars , big businessmen , total white-collar . and all the girls in the agency get a grand a night . at least five hundred . they drive porsches , live in condos , have stockbrokers , carry beepers , you know , like nancy allen in `` dressed to kill '' . and when i was ready he 'd call 'em , give me a plane ticket , and send me on my way . he says he makes a nice finder 's fee for finding them hot prospects . but no one 's gon na pay a grand a night for a girl who does n't know whether to shit or wind her watch . so what i 'm doin ' for drexl now is just sorta learnin ' the ropes . it seemed like a lotta fun , but i do n't really like it much , till last night . you were only my third trick , but you did n't feel like a trick . since it was a secret , i just pretended i was on a date . an , um , i guess i want a second date .
thank you . i wan na see you again too . and again , and again , and again . bama , i know we have n't known each other long , but my parents went together all throughout high school , and they still got a divorce . so , fuck it , you wan na marry me ?	what ?
yes .	you will ?
you better not be fucking teasing me .	you better not be fuckin ' teasin ' me .
did ya ever see `` the chinese professionals '' ?	i do n't believe so .
i do .	thank you .
hello , mrs. worley .	how do you do , mr. worley ?
top o ' the morning , mrs. worley .	bottom of the ninth . mr. worley . oh , by the by , mr. worley , have you seen your lovely wife today ?
oh , you 're speaking of my charming wife mrs. alabama worley .	of course . are there others , mr. worley ?
no no no no no no no no no ...	yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes ...
where you goin ' , honey ?	i just got ta get somethin ' .
sweetheart , write down your former address .	what ?
write down drexl 's address .	why ?
so i can go over there and pick up your things .	no , clarence . just forget it , babe . i just wan na disappear from there .
look , sweetheart , he scares you . but i 'm not scared of that motherfucker . he ca n't touch you now . you 're completely out of his reach . he poses absolutely no threat to us . so , if he does n't matter , which he does n't , it would be stupid to lose your things , now would n't it ?	you do n't know him -
was it him or you ?	yeah . but to be honest , i put myself in that position . when i drove up there i said to myself , `` if i can kill 'em and get away with it , i 'll do it . '' i could . so i did .
is this a joke ?	no joke . this is probably the best hamburger i 've ever had . i 'm serious , i 've never had a hamburger taste this good .
i think what you did was ...	what ?
i think what you did ...	what ?
do you want some wine , sweetheart ?	nope . i 'm not really a wine gal .
you did it , quickdraw . i 'm so proud of you . you were like a ninja . did i do my part ok ?	babalouey , you were perfect , i could hardly keep from busting up .
i felt so stupid just blowing those bubbles .	you were chillin ' , kind of creepy even . you totally fucked with his head . i 'm gon na go grab dinner .
ya know , i used to fuckin ' hate airports .	really ?
with a vengeance , i hated them .	how come ?
i used to live by one back in dearborn . it 's real frustratin ' to be surrounded by airplanes when you ai n't got shit . i hated where i was , but i could n't do anythin ' about it . i did n't have enough money . it was tough enough just tryin ' to pay my rent every month , an ' here i was livin ' next to an airport . whenever i went outside , i saw fuckin ' planes take off drownin ' out my show . all day long i 'm seein ' , hearin ' people doin ' what i wanted to do most , but could n't .	what ?
but knowin ' me and you gon na be nigger-rich gives me a whole new outlook . i love airports now . me 'n ' you can get on any one of those planes out there , and go anywhere we ant .	you ai n't kiddin ' , we got lives to start over , we should go somewhere where we can really start from scatch .
i been in america all my life . i 'm due for a change . i wan na see what tv in other countries is like . besides , it 's more dramatic . where should we fly off to , my little turtledove ?	cancoon .
why cancoon ?	it 's got a nice ring to it . it sounds like a movie . `` clarence and alabama go to cancoon '' . do n't 'cha think ?
i thought it was what you wanted , clarence .	it is what i want . but i do n't want to spend the next ten years in jail . i do n't want you guys to go to jail . we do n't know what could be waiting for us up there . it 'll probably be just what it 's supposed to be . the only thing that 's waiting for us is two hundred thousand dollars . i 'm just looking at the downside .
it 's been fun thinking about the money but i can walk away from it , honey .	that rhymes .
what the fuck are you talkin ' about ?	floyd say he do n't be eatin ' pussy .
shit , any nigger say he do n't eat pussy is lyin ' his ass off .	i heard that .
shit ! nigger you smoke enough sherm your dumb ass 'll do a lot a crazy ass things . so you wo n't eat pussy ? motherfucker , you be up there suckin ' niggers ' dicks .	heard that .
damn skippy . he like it , too .	me thinketh he doth protest too much .
nigger , get real . you touch jayne kennedy she 'll have you ass in wayne county so fast -	nigger , back off , you ai n't beatin ' shit . now what would you do .
i 'm hip .	in fact , i 'm gon na show you what i mean with a little demonstration . big d , toss me that shotgun .
hold on a second , big d. you sayin ' you eat pussy ?	nigger , i eat everything . i eat pussy . i eat the butt . i eat every motherfuckin ' thang .
go on pussy-eaters ... laugh . you look like you be eatin ' pussy . you got pussy-eatin ' mugs . now if a nigger wants to get his dick sucked he 's got to do a bunch of fucked-up shit .	so you do eat pussy !
naw naw !	you do n't like it , but you eat that shit . he eats it .
ai n't no man have to eat pussy !	take that shit somewhere else .
what ?	can you live with it ?
live with what ?	with that son-of-a-bitch walkin ' around breathin ' the same air as you ? and gettin ' away with it every day . are you haunted ?
yeah .	you wan na get unhaunted ?
yeah .	then shoot 'em . shoot 'em in the face . and feed that boy to the dogs .
i ca n't believe what you 're tellin ' me .	i ai n't tellin ' ya nothin ' . i 'm just sayin ' what i 'd do .
you 'd really do that ?	he do n't got no right to live .
look , elvis , he is hauntin ' me . he does n't deserve to live . and i do want to kill him . but i do n't wan na go to jail for the rest of my life .	i do n't blame you .
if i thought i could get away with it -	killin ' 'em 's the hard part . gettin ' away with it 's the easy part . whaddaya think the cops do when a pimp 's killed ? burn the midnight oil tryin ' to find who done it ? they could n't give a flyin ' fuck if all the pimps in the whole wide world took two in the back of the fuckin ' head . if you do n't get caught at the scene with the smokin ' gun in your hand , you got away with it .
clarence , i got ta hand it to ya . you were cooler than cool .	i was dying . i thought for sure everyone could see it on my face .
all anybody saw was clint eastwood drinkin ' coffee .	can you develop an ulcer in two minutes ? being cool is hard on your body .
oh , and your line to charles atlas in there : `` i 'll take that gun '' , `` you 'll have to '' .	that was cool , was n't it ? you know , i do n't even know where that came from . i just opened my mouth and it came out . after i said it i thought , that 's a cool line , i got ta remember that .
how do you think i 'm doin ' with lee ?	are you kiddin ' ? he loves you .
you do n't think i 'm kissin ' his ass , do you ?	you 're tellin ' him what he wants to hear , but that ai n't the same thing as kissin ' his ass .
i 'm not lyin ' to him . i mean it . i loved `` coming home in a body bag '' .	that 's why it does n't come across as ass-kissin ' , because it 's genuine , and he can see that .
where the fuck is that bitch ?	she 's with me .
who the fuck are you ?	i 'm her husband .
grab a seat there , boy . want some dinner ? grab yourself an egg roll . we got everything here from a diddle-eyed-joe to a damned-if-i-know .	no thanks .
wannabee nigger ...	fuck you ! my mother was apache .
clarence ?	you got it .
it 's great to hear from you .	well , you 're gon na be seein ' me shortly .
you comin ' to l.a. ? when ?	tomorrow .
well , there 's a story behind all that . i 'll tell you when i see you . by the way , i wo n't be alone . i 'm bringing my wife with me .	get the fuck outta here !
i 'm a married man .	get the fuck outta here !
what ?	tell him we 'll be hittin ' his area some time tomorrow .
alabama , could you tell clar -	ask him if he got the letter .
clarence sent a letter ?	has he gotten his mail today ?
money problems ?	now tell him goodbye .
that 's a pretty amazing story .	well , she 's a pretty amazing girl . what are women like out here ?
just like in detroit , only skinnier .	you goin ' out ?
well , for the past couple of years i 've been goin ' out with girls from my acting class .	good for you .
... formica . i did real well . i think she liked me .	did you meet captain kirk ?
how much of that letter was on the up and up ?	every word of it .
you 're really in love , are n't you ?	for the very first time in my life . do you know what that 's like ?
this shit ca n't be real .	it 'll get ya high .
it 's fuckin ' real ! it 's fuckin ' real !	i certainly hope so .
you 've got a helluva lotta coke there , man !	i know .
do you have any idea how much fuckin ' coke you got ?	tell me .
this is drexl 's coke ?	drexl 's dead . this is clarence 's coke and clarence can do whatever he wants with it . and what clarence wants to do is sell it . then me and bama are gon na leave on a jet plane and spend the rest of our lives spendin ' . so , you got my letter , have you lined up any buyers ?
but you 're an actor . i hear these hollywood guys have it delivered to the set .	yeah , they do . and maybe when i start being a successful actor i 'll know those guys . but most of the people i know are like me . they ai n't got a pot to piss in or a window to throw it out of . now , if you want to sell a little bit at a time -
no way ! the whole enchilada in one shot .	do you have any idea how difficult that 's gon na be ?
i 'm offering a half a million dollars worth of white for two hundred thousand . how difficult can that be ?	it 's difficult because you 're sellin ' it to a particular group . big shots . fat cats . guys who can use that kind of quantity . guys who can afford two hundred thousand . basically , guys i do n't know . you do n't know . and , more important , they do n't know you . i did talk with one guy who could possibly help you .
is he big league ?	he 's nothing . he 's in my acting class . but he works as an assistant to a very powerful movie producer named lee donowitz . i thought donowitz could be interested in a deal like this . he could use it . he could afford it .
what'd'ya tell 'em ?	hardly anything . i was n't sure from your letter what was bullshit , and what was n't .
what 's this acting class guy 's name ?	elliot .
elliot what ?	elliot blitzer .
ok , call 'im up and arrange a meeting , so we can get through all the getting to know you stuff .	where ?
the zoo .	the zoo . what are you waiting for ?
would you just shut up a minute and let me think ?	what 's to think about ?
shut up ! first you come waltzing into my life after two years . you 're married . you killed a guy .	two guys .
two guys . now you want me to help you with some big drug deal . fuck , clarence , you killed somebody and you 're blowin ' it off like it do n't mean shit .	do n't expect me to be all broken up over poor drexl . i think he was a fuckin ' , freeloadin ' , parasitic scumbag , and he got exactly what he deserved . i got no pity for a mad dog like that . i think i should get a merit badge or somethin ' .
clarence ...	let me handle this .
yeah , well if we got lost , it 's your ass . come on , clarence , lets go . elliot 's going to meet us in the lobby .	i 'm just makin ' sure we got everything . you got yours ?
i got the part on `` t.j. hooker '' .	no shit ? dick , that 's great !
they did n't even want a callback . they just hired me like that . me and peter breck are the two heavies . we start shooting monday . my call is for seven o'clock in the morning .	ah , dick , let 's talk about it in the car . we ca n't be late .
clarence .	yeah ?
what the fuck did you bring that for .	in case .
in case of what ?	in case they try to kill us . i do n't know , what do you want me to say ?
look , dillinger , lee donowitz is not a pimp -	i know that richard . i do n't think i 'll need it . but something this last week has taught me , it 's better to have a gun and not to need it than to need a gun and not to have it .
do you really mean it ?	no , i do n't really mean it . well , i mean , this is our last chance to think about it . how 'bout you , bama ?
now 's a helluva time to play `` what if '' .	this is our last chance to play `` what if '' . i want to do it . i 'm just scared of getting caught .
well , if we 're not gon na do it , let 's just get in the car and get the fuck outta here .	yeah , let 's just get outta here .
no . but thanks .	no thanks , my stomach 's a little upset . i ate somethin ' at a restaurant that made me a little sick .
i 'd fuck elvis .	really ?
when he was alive . i would n't fuck him now .	i do n't blame you . so we 'd both fuck elvis . it 's nice to meet people with common interests , is n't it ?
well , enough about the king , how 'bout you ?	how 'bout me what ?
how 'bout you go to the movies with me tonight ?	what are we gon na see ?
a donny chiba triple feature . `` the streetfighter '' , `` return of the streetfighter '' , and `` sister streetfighter '' .	who 's sonny chiba ?
he is , bar none , the greatest actor working in martial arts movies ever .	you wan na take me to a kung fu movie ?
so you guys got five hundred thousand dollars worth of cola that you 're unloading -	want an animal cracker ?
leave the gorillas .	- that you 're unloading for two hundred thousand dollars -
i grow it on my window-sill . the lights really great there and i 'm up high enough so you ca n't see it from the street .	ha ha ha . no really , where does it come from ?
coco leaves . you see , they take the leaves and mash it down until it 's kind of a paste -	look , dick , i do n't -
no problem , elliot . i 'm just fuckin ' wit ya , that 's all . actually , i 'll tell you but you got ta keep it quiet . understand , if dick did n't assure me you 're good people i 'd just tell ya , none of your fuckin ' business . but , as a sign of good faith , here it goes : i got ta friend in the department .	what department ?
what do you think , eightball ?	the police department ?
duh . what else would i be talking about ? now stop askin ' stupid doorknob questions . well , a year and a half ago , this friend of mine got access to the evidence room for an hour . he snagged this coke . but , he 's a good cop with a wife and a kid , so he sat on it for a year and a half until he found a guy he could trust .	he trusts you ?
we were in four h together . we 've known each other since childhood . so , i 'm handling the sales part . he 's my silent partner and he knows if i get fucked up , i wo n't drop dime on him . i did n't tell you nothin ' and you did n't hear nothin ' .	sure . i did n't hear anything .
what ?	do i look like a beautiful blond with big tits and an ass that tastes like french vanilla ice-cream ?
no . no , you do n't .	then why are you telling me all this bullshit just so you can fuck me ?
get it straight , lee is n't into taking risks . he deals with a couple of guys , and he 's been dealing with them for years . they 're reliable . they 're dependable . and , they 're safe .	riddle me this , batman . if you 're all so much in love with each other , what the fuck are you doing here ? i 'm sure you got better things to do with your time than walk around in circles starin ' up a panther 's ass . your guy 's interested because with that much shit at his fingertips he can play joe fuckin ' hollywood till the wheels come off . he can sell it , he can snort it , he can play santa claus with it . at the price he 's payin ' , he 'll be everybody 's best friend . and , you know , that 's what we 're talkin ' about here . i 'm not puttin ' him down . hey , let him run wild . have a ball , it 's his money . but , do n't expect me to hang around forever waitin ' for you guys to grow some guts .
he wants to talk ya .	mr. donowitz ? i told you , through dick . he 's in my acting class . about a year . yeah , he 's good . they grew up together . sure thing .
he says wednesday at three o'clock at the beverly wilshire . he wants everybody there . he 'll talk to you . if after talkin ' to you he 's convinced you 're ok , he 'll do business . if not , he 'll say fuck it and walk out the door . he also wants a sample bag .	no problems on both counts .
where 's everybody else ?	they 'll be along .
well , i guess it 's about that time .	i guess so . follow me .
elliot .	yeah ?
do n't you ?	no .
say it , goddamn it !	you are the dumbest person in the world .
apparently i 'm not as dumb as you thought i am .	no . no you 're not .
yeah , i subscribe . it 's a pretty decent one .	have you read the story on elvis ?
no . not yet .	you know , i saw it on the stands , my first inclination was to buy it . but , i look at the price and say forget it , it 's just gon na be the same old shit . i ended up breaking down and buying it a few days later . man , i was ever wrong .
it tried to pin down what the attraction is after all these years . it covers the whole spectrum of fans , the people who love his music , the people who grew up with him , the artists he inspired - bob dylan , bruce springsteen , and the fanatics , like these guys . i do n't know about you , but they give me the creeps .	i can see what you mean .
i do n't know , clarence , `` doctor zhivago '' is a pretty big movie .	the biggest . the biggest movie you 've ever dealt with , lee . we 're talkin ' a lot of film . a man 'd have ta be an idiot not to be a little cautious about a movie like that . and lee , you 're no idiot .
but the bottom line is : i 'm not paramount . i have a select group of distributers i deal with . i buy their little movies . accomplish what i wan na accomplish , end of story . easy , business-like , very little risk .	now that 's bullshit , lee . every time you buy one of those little movies it 's a risk . i 'm not sellin ' you something that 's gon na play two weeks , six weeks , then go straight to cable . this is `` doctor zhivago '' . this 'll be packin ' 'em in for a year and a half . two years ! that 's two years you do n't have to work with anybody 's movie but mine .
well , then , what 's the hurry ? is it true the rights to `` doctor zhivago '' are in arbitration ?	i wan na be able to announce this deal at cannes . if i had time for a courtship , lee , i would . i 'd take ya out , i 'd hold your hand , i 'd kiss you on the cheek at the door . but , i 'm not in that position . i need to know if we 're in bed together , or not . if you want my movie , lee , you 're just gon na have to come to terms with your fear and desire .
well , i have to admit , walkin ' through the door and seein ' these `` soldier of fortune '' poster boys made me a bit nervous . but , lee , i 'm fairly confident that you came here to do business , not to be a wise-guy . so , if you want , i 'll put the gun on the table .	i do n't think that 'll be necessary . let 's all have a seat . boris , why do n't you be nice and get coffee for everybody .
oh , mr. donowitz -	lee , clarence . please do n't insult me . call me lee .
ok , sorry , lee . i just wan na tell you `` coming home in a body bag '' is one of my favorite movies . after `` apocalypse now '' i think it 's the best vietnam movie ever .	thank you very much , clarence .
you know , most movies that win a lot of oscars , i ca n't stand . `` sophie 's choice '' , `` ordinary people '' , `` kramer vs. kramer '' , `` gandhi '' . all that stuff is safe , geriatric , coffee-table dog shit .	i hear you talkin ' clarence . we park our cars in the same garage .
now , that 's practically uncut . you could , if you so desire , cut it a helluva lot more .	do n't worry , i 'll desire . boris , could i have some more coffee .
you like a little coffee with your cream and sugar ?	i 'm not satisfied till the spoon stands straight up .
where 'd you go ?	a norms in van nuys .
elliot tells me you 're fronting for a dirty cop .	well , elliot was n't supposed to tell you anythin ' . thanks a lot , bigmouth . i knew you were a squid the moment i laid eyes on you . in my book , buddy , you 're a piece of shit . he 's not a dirty cop , he 's a good cop . he just saw his chance and he took it .
why does he trust you ?	we grew up together .
if you do n't know shit , why does he think you can sell it ?	i bullshitted him .
wan na count your money ?	actually , they can count it . i 'd like to use the little boy 's room .
i think there 's a seven-up in there .	anything stronger ? oh , probably not . beer ? you can drink beer , ca n't you ?
i can , but i do n't .	that 's about all i ever eat .
go to the liquor store - where is there a liquor store around here ?	uh , yeah ... there 's a party store down 54th .
i 'm really not very -	you know what would taste good ? chicken . i have n't had chicken in a while . chicken would really hit the spot about now . chicken and beer , definitly , absolutely , without a doubt . where 's a good chicken place around here ?
i really do n't know .	you do n't know the chicken places around where you live ? ask the guy at the place where a chicken place is .
is n't she the sweetest goddamned girl you ever saw in your whole life ? is she a four alarm fire , or what ?	she seems very nice .
daddy . nice is n't the word . nice is an insult . she 's a peach . that 's the only word for it , she 's a peach . she even tastes like a peach . you can tell i 'm in love with her . you can tell by my face , ca n't ya ? it 's a dead giveaway . it 's written all over it . ya know what ? she loves me back . take a seat , pop , we got ta talk -	clarence , just shut up , you 're giving me a headache ! i ca n't believe how much like your mother you are . you 're your fuckin ' mother through and through . i have n't heard from ya in three years . then ya show up all of a sudden at eight o'clock in the morning . you walk in like a goddamn bulldozer ... do n't get me wrong , i 'm happy to see you ... just slow it down . now , when did you get married ?
look , i do n't know this is pretty heavy-duty , so if you wan na explode , feel free .	you 're always making jokes . that 's what you do , is n't it ? make jokes . making jokes is the one thing you 're good at , is n't it ? but if you make a joke about this - - i 'm gon na go completely out of my fuckin ' head !
what do you want from me ?	what ?
stop acting like an infant . you 're here because you want me to help you in some way . what do you need from me ? you need money ?	do you still have friends on the force ?
yes , i still have friends on the force .	could you find out if they know anythin ' ? i do n't know they know shit about us . but i do n't wan na think , i wan na know . you could find out for sure what 's goin ' on . daddy ?
what makes you think i could do that ?	you were a cop .
what makes you think i would do that ?	i 'm your son .
you got it all worked out , do n't you ?	look , goddamnit , i never asked you for a goddamn thing ! i 've tried to make your parental obligation as easy as possible . after mom divorced you , did i ask you for anything ? when i would n't see ya for six months to a year at a time , did you ever get your shit about it ? no , it was always `` ok '' , `` no problem '' , `` you 're a busy guy , i understand '' . the whole time you were a drunk , did i ever point my finger at you and talk shit ? no ! everybody else did . i never did . you see , i know that you 're just a bad parent . you 're not really very good at it . but i know you love me . i 'm basically a pretty resourceful guy . if i did n't really need it i would n't ask . and if you say no , do n't worry about it . i 'm gone . no problems .
they have nothing . in fact , they think it 's drug related .	do tell . why drug related ?
apparently , drexl had a big toe stuck in shit like that .	no shit ?
yeah . drexl had an association with a fella named blue lou boyle . name mean anything to you ?	nope .
if you do n't hang around in this circle , no reason it should .	who is he ?
gangster . drug dealer . somebody you do n't want on your ass . look , clarence , the more i hear about this drexl fucker , the more i think you did the right thing . that guy was n't just some wild flake .	that 's what i 've been tellin ' ya . the guy was like a mad dog . so the cops are n't looking for me ?
thanks a lot , daddy . you really came through for me .	i got some money i can give you -
keep it .	well , son , i want you to know i hope everything works out with you and alabama . i like her . i think you make a cute couple .
we do make a cute couple , do n't we ?	yeah , well , just stay outta trouble . remeber , you got a wife to think about . quit fuckin ' around . i love you son .
do you know who i am , mr. worley ?	i give up . who are you ?
i 'm the anti-christ . you get me in a vendetta kind of mood , you will tell the angels in heaven that you had never seen pure evil so singularly personified as you did in the face of the man who killed you . my name is vincenzo coccotti . i work as a counsel for mr. blue lou boyle , the man your son stole from . i hear you were once a cop so i assume you 've heard od us before . am i correct ?	i 've heard of blue lou boyle .
i 'm glad . hopefully that will clear up the how-full-of-shit-i-am question you 've been asking yourself . now , we 're gon na have a little q and a , and , at the risk of sounding redundant , please make your answers genuine . want a chesterfield ?	no .
i have a son of my own . about you boy 's age . i can imagine how painful this must be for you . but clarence and that bitch-whore girlfriend of his brought this all on themselves . and i implore you not to go down the road with 'em . you can always take comfort in the fact that you never had a choice .	look , i 'd help ya if i could , but i have n't seen clarence -
i 've seen him .	now i ca n't be sure of how much of what he told you . so in the chance you 're in the dark about some of this , let me shed some light . that whore your boy hangs around with , her pimp is an associate of mine , and i do n't just mean pimpin ' , in other affairs he works for me in a courier capacity . well , apparently , that dirty little whore found out when we 're gon na do some business , 'cause your son , the cowboy and his flame , came in the room blastin ' and did n't stop till they were pretty sure everybody was dead .
what are you talkin ' about ?	i 'm talkin ' about a massacre . they snatched my narcotics and hightailed it outta there . wouldda gotten away with it , but your son , fuckhead that he is , left his driver 's license in a dead guy 's hand . a whore hiding in the commode filled in all the blanks .
i do n't believe you .	that 's of minor importance . but what 's of major fuckin ' importance is that i believe you . where did they go ?
on their honeymoon .	i 'm gettin ' angry askin ' the same question a second time . where did they go ?
could i have one of those chesterfields now ?	sure .
oh , do n't bother . i got one . so you 're a sicilian , huh ?	uh-huh .
come again ?	it 's a fact . sicilians have nigger blood pumpin ' through their hearts . if you do n't believe me , look it up . you see , hundreds and hundreds of years ago the moors conquered sicily . and moors are niggers . way back then , sicilians were like the wops in northern italy . blond hair , blue eyes . but , once the moors moved in there , they changed the whole country . they did so much fuckin ' with the sicilian women , they changed the blood-line for ever , from blond hair and blue eyes to black hair and dark skin . i find it absolutely amazing to think that to this day , hundreds of years later , sicilians still carry that nigger gene . i 'm just quotin ' history . it 's a fact . it 's written . your ancestors were niggers . your great , great , great , great , great-grandmother was fucked by a nigger , and had a half-nigger kid . that is a fact . now tell me , am i lyin ' ?
it 's about that pimp that was shot a couple of days ago , drexl spivey .	what about him ?
well , ted , to tell you the truth , i found out through the grapevine that it might be , and i only said might be , the drexl spivey that was responsible for that restaurant break-in on riverdale .	are you still working security for foster & langley ?
yeah , and the restaurant 's on my route . and you know , i stuck my nose in for the company to try to put a stop to some of these break-ins . now , while i have no proof , the name drexl spivey kept comin ' up who 's case is it ?	mcteague .
i do n't know him . is he a nice guy ? you think he 'll help me out ?	i do n't see why not . when you gon na come round and see my new place ?
you and robin moved ?	shit , are you behind . me and robin got a divorce six months ago . got myself a new place - mirrors all over the bedroom , ceiling fans above the bed . guy 'd have to look as ugly as king kong not to get laid in this place . i 'm serious , a guy 'd have to look like a gorilla .
i 'm me ... i mean , that 's me .	step inside .
well , the part you 're reading for is one of the bad guys . there 's brian and marty . peter breck 's already been cast as brian . and you 're reading for the part of marty . now in this scene you 're both in a car and bill shatner 's hanging on the hood . and what you 're trying to do is get him off . whenever you 're ready .	where 'd you come from ?
i do n't know . he just appeared as magic .	well , do n't just sit there , shoot him .
that was very good .	thank you .
if we decided on making him a new york type , could you do that ?	sure . no problem .
could we try it now ?	absolutely .
where 'd he come from ?	i do n't know . he just appeared as magic .
both you , idiots shut up , i ca n't understand shit ! now , what 's happened , what 's going on , and what are you talking about ?	okee-dokee . it 's like this , krinkle ; a patrol car stops this dork for speeding , they walk up to window and the guy 's covered in coke . so they bring his ass in and me an ' nicholson go to work on him .
that vietnam movie ?	uh-huh .
that was a good fuckin ' movie .	sure was .
do you believe him ?	i believe he believes him .
he 'll wear a wire ?	we talked him into it .
dirty cops . we 'll have to bring in internal affairs on this .	look , we do n't care if you bring in the state milita , the volunteer fire department , the l.a. thunderbirds , the ghost of steve mcqueen , and the twelve roman gladiators , so long as we get credit for the bust .
look , sunshine , we found a sandwich bag of uncut cocaine -	not a tiny little vial -
but a fuckin ' baggie .	no do n't sit here and feed us some shit .
you got caught . it 's all fun and fuckin ' games till you get caught . but now we gotcha . ok , mr. elliot actor , you 've just made the big time -	you 're no longer an extra -
or a bit player -	or a supporting actor -
you 're a fuckin ' star ! and you 're gon na be playin ' your little one-man show nightly for the next two fuckin ' years for a captive audience -	but there is a bright side though . if you ever have to play a part of a guy who gets fucked in the ass on a daily basis by throat-slitting niggers , you 'll have so much experience to draw on -
and just think , when you get out in a few years , you 'll meet some girl , get married , and you 'll be so understanding to your wife 's needs , because you 'll know what it 's like to be a woman .	'course you 'll wan na fuck her in the ass . pussy just wo n't feed right anymore -
krinkle , this is it . we got it , man . and it 's all ours . i mean talk about fallin ' into somethin ' . you shoulda seen it , it was beautiful . dimes is hittin ' him from the left about being fucked in the ass by niggers , i 'm hittin ' him form the right about not likin ' pussy anymore , finally he starts cryin ' , and then it was all over -	krinkle , you 're lookin ' at the two future cops of the month . we have it , and if i say we , i do n't mean me and him , i 'm referring to the whole department . have n't had a decent bust this whole month . well , we mighta come in like a lamb , but we 're goin ' out like a lion -
nicholson and i .	nicholson and i go to work on him . now er know somthing 's rotten in denmark , 'cause this dickhead had a big bag , and it 's uncut , too , so we 're sweatin ' him , trying to find out where he got it . scarin ' the shit outta him .
which was n't too hard , the guy was a real squid .	so we got this guy scared shitless and he starts talkin ' . and , krinkle , you ai n't gon na fuckin ' believe it .
suspect 's words -	to front for him . so elliot is workin ' out the deal between them and his boss , a big movie producer named lee donowitz .
he 's so spooked he 'd turn over his momma , his daddy , his two-panny granny , and anna and the king of siam if he had anything on him .	this rabbit 'll do anything not to do time , including wearing a wire .
like gang-busters . now , remember , if you do n't want to go to jail , we got ta put your boss in jail .	we have to show in court that , without a doubt , a successful man , an important figure in the hollywood community , is also dealing cocaine .
you do more than try .	you do .
he knows .	how the fuck could he know ?
he saw the wire .	how 's he supposed to see the wire ?
we got ta get him outta there .	whatta we gon na do ? he 's in an elevator .
he 's bluffin ya , elliot . ca n't you see that ? you 're an actor , remember , the show must go on .	this guy 's gon na kill him .
do n't blow it , elliot . he 's bluffin ' . he just told you so himself .	you 're an actor , so act , motherfucker .
what was i sayin ' ?	rock whores .
looky here , you want the bitches to really fly high , make your rocks with cherry seven-up .	pussy love pink rocks .

preach on , big d .	look here . if i ever did eat some pussy - i would never eat any pussy - but , if i did eat some pussy , i sure as hell would n't tell no goddamn body . i 'd be ashamed as a motherfucker .
yeah , that 's right , laugh . it 's so funny , oh it 's so funny . there used to be a time when sisters did n't know shit about gettin ' their pussy licked . then the sixties came an ' they started fuckin ' around with white boys . and white boys are freaks for that shit -	- because it 's good !

you 're the one who wanted to drive fast .	read my lips .
hello , is dick ritchie here ?	naw , he ai n't home right now .
do you live here ?	yeah , i live here .
sorta room-mates ?	exactly room-mates .
maybe you can help me . actually , who i 'm looking for is a friend of ours from detroit . clarence worley ? i heard he was in town . might be travelling with a pretty girl named alabama . have you seen him ? are they stayin ' here ?	naw , they ai n't stayin ' here . but , i know who you 're talkin ' about . they 're stayin ' at the hollywood holiday inn .
how do you know ? you been there ?	no , i ai n't been there . but i heard him say . hollywood holiday inn . kinda easy to remember .
yes .	are you dick ritchie ?
no .	do you know a clarence worley ?
yes .	do you know where we can find him ?
he 's at the beverly wilshire .	where 's that ?
excuse me , mr. coccotti . do you know nick cardella ?	no .
then where the hell do you get off talkin ' that kind of talk ?	i did n't mean -
what was the jew-boy 's name ?	donowitz , he said .
we want you to tell us about last night .	i went to the surface and i collected specimens like i was told .
wake up , cole .	uh , i did n't hear the ...
no , sir !	we have a very advanced program , something very different , requires very skilled people .
well ?	uh , what ?
him ? you saw that man ?	uh , i think so . in the mental hospital .
women will want to get to know you ...	i do n't want your `` women , '' you brainless twit ! i want to be well !
the food , the sky , the certain , uh , sexual temptations -- you have n't become `` addicted '' have you , cole ? to that `` dying '' world '	no , sir ! i just want to do my part . to get us back on top ... in charge of the planet . and i have the experience , i know who the people are ...
you said we were n't `` real , '' cole ...	well , sir , i do n't think the human mind was built to exist in two different ... whatever you call it ... '' dimensions . '' it 's stressful , you said it yourselves , it gets you confused . you do n't know what 's real and what 's not .
i understand . there 'd be no point .	we 're going to think about it , cole . among ourselves . we 'll get back to you .
to be determined by the proper authorities .	you do n't want to jeopardize that reduction , do you , cole ? have it taken away ?
we want tough minded people . strong mentally . we 've had some ... misfortunes with `` unstable '' types .	for a man in your position ... an opportunity .
he 's drugged out of his mind ! he 's completely zoned out .	cole , did you or did you not record that message ?
but just until you recover your , uh , ... equilibrium .	you 're still a little ... disoriented .
we 're very close ! because of you !	this is it , james ... what you 've been working for .
i told you that fuckhead mason would get us into something like this .	shut up !
that 's him .	what are you going to do with us ?
it 's the kidnap woman -- the one who was with the guy who tied us up .	what 's she doing ?
wow , a guy in a chevy is chasing her and some other guy i ca n't see .	hey , no problem , it 's probably just another kidnapping featuring jeffrey 's shrink , pardon me , make that ex-shrink . this is your leader , a certifiable lunatic who told his former psychiatrist all his plans for god knows what whacko irresponsible schemes , and now who knows what she 's painted out there on our wall ?
it 's important to observe everything .	i think it was ... i 'm sure it was 2nd street .
they forced me to take drugs .	forced you ! why would someone force you to take drugs ?
let 's consider again our current information -- if the symptoms were first detected in philadelphia on june 28 , 1995 , that makes us know that ... ?	it was released in philadelphia , probably on june 14 , 1995 .
san francisco , new orleans , rio de janeiro , rome , kinshasa , karachi , bangkok , then peking .	meaning ... ? ? ?
that the virus was taken from philadelphia to san francisco , then to new orleans , rio de janeiro , rome , kinshasa , karachi , bangkok , then peking .	and your only goal is ... ? ? ?
to find out where the virus is so a qualified scientist can travel back into the past and study the original virus .	so that ... ? ? ?
mr. cole ? my name is doctor railly . i 'm a psychiatrist . i work for the county -- i do n't work for the police . my only concern is your well being -- do you understand that ?	i need to go now .
i 'm going to be completely honest . i 'm not going to lie to you . i ca n't make the police let you go ... but i do want to help you . and i want you to trust me . can you do that , james ? may i call you `` james '' ?	`` james '' ! nobody ever calls me that .
have you been a patient at county ? have i seen you someplace ?	no , not possible . listen , i have to get out of here . i 'm supposed to be getting information .
what kind of information ?	it wo n't help you . you ca n't do anything about it . you ca n't change anything .
change what ?	i need to go .
do you know why you 're here , james .	because i 'm a good observer . because i have a tough mind .
i see . you do n't remember assaulting a police officer ... several officers ?	they wanted identification . i do n't have any identification . i was n't trying to hurt them .
you do n't have a driver 's license , james ? or a social security card ?	no .
why not ? most people have some id .	you would n't understand .
you 've been in an institution , have n't you , james ? a hospital ?	i have to go .
a jail ? prison ?	underground .
hiding ?	i love this air . this is wonderful air .
what 's wonderful about the air , james ?	it 's so clean . no germs .
you 're afraid of germs ?	i have to go .
why do you think there are n't any germs in the air , james ?	this is april , right ?
july .	july ? !
do you know what year it is ?	what year is it ?
what year do you think it is ?	1995 ?
you think it 's july of 1995 ? that 's the future , james . do you think you 're living in the future ?	no , 1995 is the past .
it was some lady . she did n't know anything .	perhaps it was a wrong number ...
james , where did you grow up ? was it around here ? around baltimore ?	what ?
i have the ... strangest feeling i 've met you before ... a long time ago , perhaps . were you ever ... ?	wait ! this is only 1989 ! i 'm supposed to be leaving messages in 1995. it 's not the right number yet . that 's the problem . damn ! how can i contact them ?
it 's just a shot to calm you .	no more drugs . please ...
cole ! james cole ! you escaped from a locked room six years ago .	1989. six years for you . there 's the sign ! right here !
i ca n't believe this is a coincidence , mr. cole . have you been ... following me ?	you told me you 'd help me . i know this is n't what you meant , but ... i was desperate ... no money ... bum leg ... sleeping on the streets . i probably smell bad . sorry about that . but then i saw your book in a store window with a notice about your lecture . i can read , remember ?
yes , i remember . why do you want to go to philadelphia ?	it 's the next step . i checked out the baltimore information , it was nothing . it 's philadelphia , that 's where they are , the ones who killed everyone . zs that a radio ? does it play music ?
you used to call me `` james '' .	you 'd prefer that ? ... james ... you do n't really have a gun , do you .
`` never cry wolf ! ''	what ?
my father told me that . `` never cry wolf . '' then people wo n't believe you if ... something really happens .	`` if something really happens '' ... like what , james ?
did something terrible happen to you when you were a child ? something so bad ... ?	ohhhh , that one ! can we hear that one ?
you were in my dream just now . your hair was different , but i 'm sure it was you .	we dream about what 's important in our lives . and i seem to have become pretty important in yours . what was the dream about ?
about an airport ... before everything happened . it 's the same dream i always have -- the only one . i 'm a little kid in it .	and i was in it ? what did i do ?
you were very upset . you 're always very upset in the dream , but i never knew it was you before .	it was n't me before , james . it 's become me now because of ... what 's happening . please untie me .
no , i think it was always you . it 's very strange .	you 're flushed . and you were moaning . i think you 're running a fever . what are you doing ?
my notes . observations . clues .	clues ? what kind of clues ?
a secret army . the army of the twelve monkeys . i 've told you about them . they spread the virus . that 's why we have to get to philadelphia . i have to find them -- it 's my assignment .	what will you do ... when you find this ... secret army ?
does that disturb you , james ? thinking about that little boy in the well ?	when i was a kid i identified with that kid , down there alone in that pipe ... a hundred feet down -- does n't know if they 're going to save him .
what do you mean -- when you were a kid ?	nevermind . it 's not real -- it 's a hoax . a prank . he 's hiding in a barn . hey , turn left here . left !
look , i 'm warning you . you do anything , i 'm going to go crazy -- hurt people !	i 'm not going to `` do '' anything , i promise . but you need help , james . none of this is what you think it is .
they 're keeping an eye on me .	who 's keeping an eye on you ?
are you hurt ?	uh , no . yes . i mean , just some scrapes ...
oh , jesus , james ! you killed him !	i did him a favor . now come on .
you did n't have a gun before , did you ?	i 've got one now .
i told you what i want . lock the door !	james , why do n't we ... ?
mason ? ? ?	jeffrey mason ?
all i see are dead people . everywhere . what 's three more ?	you know dr. mason 's son , jeffrey mason , do n't you , james ? you met him in the county hospital six years ago .
the guy was a total fruitcake .	and he told you then his father was a famous virologist .
we need gas .	i thought you did n't know how to drive .
i said i was too young to drive . i did n't say i was stupid .	what 's the matter with your leg ?
i got shot . look -- there 's a gas station up ahead .	shot ! who shot you ?
you were going to run out off gas on purpose , were n't you ?	no . i want you to turn yourself in , james -- it 'll go much better for you if you do -- but i 'm not going to trick you .
you smell so good .	you have to give yourself up , you know .
what have you done ? did you ... kill someone ?	no ! i ... do n't think so . i stole a car and they chased me . i hit a tree .
see -- you can drive after all !	yeah , sort of , i guess . i ... i 'm sorry i locked you up . i thought ... i thought ... i think maybe i am crazy !
what made you think that ?	jeffrey mason said it was my idea about the virus . and suddenly , i was n't sure . we talked when i was in the institution , and it was all ... fuzzy . the drugs and stuff . you think maybe i 'm the one who wiped out the human race ? it was my idea ?
nobody is going to wipe out the human race . not you or jeffrey or anybody else . you 've created something in your mind , james -- a substitute reality . in order to avoid something you do n't want to face .	i 'm ... '' mentally divergent '' . i would love to believe that .
i need help all right . they 're coming after me .	first , it 's important that you surrender to them instead of them catching you running . okay ?
it would be great if i 'm crazy . if i 'm wrong about everything ... the world will be okay . i 'll never have to live underground .	give me the gun .
the gun ! ... i lost it	you 're sure ?
james ! that 's a policeman . pretend you do n't know me . if he sees you ...	no , i want to turn myself in . where is he ? do n't worry -- it 's all okay now . i 'm not crazy any more ! i mean , i am crazy , mentally divergent , actually , but i know it now and i want you to help me . i want to get well ...
i do n't understand what we 're doing .	we 're avoiding the police until i can ... .talk to you .
okay ... you were standing there looking at the moon ... you were eating grass ... then what ?	i thought i was in ... prison again .
just like that ? you were in prison ?	no , not really . it 's ... it 's in my mind . like you said .
you disappeared ! one minute you were there , the next minute you were gone . did you run through the woods ?	i do n't know -- i do n't remember .
the boy in the well . how did you know that was just a hoax ?	it was ? i did n't ... know .
james , you said he was hiding in the barn ...	i think i saw a tv show like that when i was a kid . where a boy ...
what does this mean to you ?	... i had a dream about ... something like that .
you had a bullet from world war one in your leg , james ! how did it get there ?	you said i had delusions -- that i created a world -- you said you could explain everything ...
i want to be here . in this time . with you . i want to become ... become a whole person . i want this to be the present . i want the future to be unknown .	james ... do you remember ... six years ago ... you had a phone number ! you tried to call and ...
you want me to rob him ?	i ... i ... we need cash , james .
it 's a carpet cleaning company ...	a carpet cleaning company ?
no superiors ! no scientists . no people from the future . it 's just a carpet cleaning company . they have voice mail -- you leave a message telling them when you want your carpet cleaned .	you ... you left them a message ?
you ... you could n't have heard me .	they got your message , kathryn . they played it for me . it was a bad recording ... distorted . i did n't recognize your voice .
i think i 've seen this movie before . when i was a kid . it was on tv .	shh -- do n't talk . hold still .
i have seen it , but i do n't remember this part . funny , it 's like what 's happening to us , like the past . the movie never changes -- it ca n't change -- but everytime you see it , it seems to be different because you 're different -- you notice different things .	if we ca n't change anything ... because it 's already happened , then we ought to at least smell the flowers .
why are we doing this ?	so we can stick our heads out the window and feel the wind and listen to the music . so we can appreciate what we have while we have it . forgive me , psychiatrists do n't cry .
but maybe i 'm wrong . maybe you 're wrong . maybe we 're both crazy .	in a few weeks , it will have started or it wo n't . if there are still baseball games and traffic jams , armed robberies and boring tv shows -- we 'll be so happy , we 'll be glad to turn ourselves in to the police .
you were in my dream just now . i did n't recognize you .	well , you look pretty different , too .
i mean in my dream -- i did n't realize it was you . then ... i woke up and i ... i thought you were gone .	i remember you ... like this . i feel i 've known you before . i feel i 've always known you .
that 's what they were up to ! freeing animals !	on the walls -- they meant the animals when they said , `` we did it . ''
i know this place ! ... this is my dream .	airports all look the same . maybe it 's ... james ! your moustache ! it 's slipping .
they may be looking for us , james . use this . you can fix it in the men 's room .	i was here ... as a kid . i think you were here , too . but you ... looked just like you look now .
james , if we 're identified , they 're going to send us someplace ... but not to key west !	right ! you 're right . i have to fix this .
does this bother you , mr. cole ?	no ! look , i do n't belong here ! what i need to do is make a telephone call to straighten everything out .
who would you call , mr. cole , who would straighten everything out ?	scientists . i 'm supposed to report in to them . they 'll want to know they sent me to the wrong time .
so you could talk to these scientists and they do what ? send you to the future ?	no , no . i ca n't talk to them . it 's called , `` voice mail '' . i 'm supposed to leave messages . they monitor it from the present .
what 'd they give you ? thorazine ? how much ? learn your drugs -- know your doses .	i need to make a telephone call .
germs ? !	in the 18th century there was no such thing ! nobody 'd ever imagined such a thing -- no sane person anyway . along comes this doctor ... semmelweiss , i think . he tries to convince people ... other doctors mostly ... that there are these teeny tiny invisible `` bad things '' called germs that get into your body and make you ... sick ! he 's trying to get doctors to wash their hands . what is this guy ... crazy ? teeny tiny invisible whaddayou call 'em ? ... `` germs '' !
`` what about the germs ? '' i say . he goes , `` i do n't believe in germs . germs are just a plot they made up so they can sell you disinfectants and soap ! '' now , he 's crazy , right ? hey , you believe in germs , do n't you ?	i 'm not crazy .
of course not , i never thought you were . you want to escape , right ? that 's very sane . i can help you . you want me to , do n't you ? get you out ?	if you know how to escape , why do n't you ... ?
why do n't i escape , that 's what you were going to ask me , right ? 'cause i 'd be crazy to escape ! i 'm all taken care of , see ? i 've sent out word .	what 's that mean ?
they hurt you !	not as bad as what they 're doing to kitty .
look at those assholes , they 're asking for it ! maybe people deserved to be wiped out !	wiping cut the human race ! that 's a great idea ! but it 's more of a long term thing -- right now we have to focus on more immediate goals . i did n't say a word about `` you know what '' .
what are you talking about ? ? ?	you know -- your plan .
what 're you writing ? you a reporter ?	it 's private .
what ... . ? ? ?	wooooo , they really dosed you , bro . major load ! listen up -- try and get it together . focus ! focus ! the plan ! remember ? i did my part .
what ... ? ? ?	not , `` what '' , babe ! when !
never saw him before in my life . go ahead and shoot him or torture him or whatever it is you do .	you do know me . you helped me once .
that would be totally out of character . helping people is against my principles . see , he definitely does n't know me . now , i 'm going to go back and listen to my father 's very eloquent discourse on the perils of science while you torture this intruder to death .	i 'm here about some monkeys .
excuse me -- what did you say ?	monkeys . twelve of them .
county hospital , right ? 1989. the `` immaculate escape '' -- am i right ? why , thank you -- you look wonderful , too .	listen to me -- i ca n't do anything about what you 're going to do . i ca n't change anything . i ca n't stop you . i just want some information ...
we need to talk . come on . upstairs . i am a new person ! i 'm completely adjusted . witness the tux . it 's armani . who chattered ? goines ? weller ?	i just need to have access to the pure virus , that 's all ! for the future !
i do n't have time to go upstairs . the police are looking for me . i need to know where it is and exactly what it is .	i get it ! this is your old plan , right ?
plan ? what are you talking about ?	remember ? we were in the dayroom , watching tv , and you were all upset about the ... desecration of the planet . and you said to me , `` would n't it be great if there was a germ or a virus that could wipe out mankind and leave the plants and animals just as they are ? '' you do remember that , do n't you ?
bulishit ! you 're fucking with my head !	and that 's when i told you my father was this famous virologist and you said , `` hey , he could make a germ and we could steal it ! ''
jose !	cole ! oh , god , cole , where are we ?
jo ... jose ? ? ? ?	pulling out the tooth , man , that was nuts ! here , take this .
me ? are you kiddin ? you 're the one ! you were a hero , man . they gave you a pardon ! and whadda you do ? you come back and fuck with your teeth ! wow !	how did you find me ?
the phone call , man . the phone call .	the call i just made ? five minutes ago ?
this part is n't about the virus , is it ?	hey , man ...
it 's about obeying , about doing what you 're told .	they gave you a pardon , man . whatdaya want ?
i mashed the spider , did n't i ?	we 'll get to the spider later , mr. cole . right now , we want to know everything that you saw .
i asked you , why did you volunteer ?	well , the guard woke me up . he told me i volunteered .
uh , that message ... me ?	it 's a digital reconstruction of a message , cole , from a weak signal on our contact number . did you make that call ?
but you know what 's real now ?	yes , sir .
do n't be defensive , kathryn , this is n't an inquisition .	i did n't think i was being defensive . i was just ...
he should have been in restraints . it was bad judgment on your part , plain and simple . why not just cop to it ?	okay , it was bad judgment . but i have the strangest feeling about him -- i 've seen him somewhere and ...
two policemen were already in the hospital and now we have an orderly with a broken arm and a security officer with a fractured skull .	i said it was bad judgment ! what else do you want me to say ?
he was fully sedated !	then are you trying to tell me that a fully sedated , fully restrained patient somehow slipped out that vent , replaced the grill behind him and that he 's wriggling through the ventilation system right now ?
he kidnapped you , kathryn . you saw him murder someone . you knew there was a real possibility he would kill you , too . you were under tremendous emotional stress .	for god sakes , owen , listen to me -- he knew about the boy in fresno and he says three billion people are going to die !
kathryn , you know he ca n't possibly know that . you 're a rational person . you 're a trained psychiatrist . you know the difference between what 's real and what 's not .	and what we believe is what 's accepted as `` truth '' now , is n't it , owen ? psychiatry -- it 's the latest religion . and we 're the priests -- we decide what 's right and what 's wrong -- we decide who 's crazy and who is n't . ... i 'm in trouble , owen . i 'm losing my faith .
what ... virus ?	she knew about it , jeffrey . she knew you were going to try this .
what virus are we talking about , dad ?	you 're insane , jeffrey .
you `` develop '' viruses and you 're calling me insane ? typical . what does this virus attack ? do n't tell me , you sick fuck , it does n't matter . have i ever `` developed '' a virus ? do i put helpless animals in cages and measure their reactions to electrical stimuli ? do i inject radioactive substances into living creatures and examine their bowel movements ? wow ! and i 'm crazy !	please tell me , jeffrey , what exactly are you going to do ? i do n't have to tell you i 'm afraid .
one dozen bolt cutters ! whadda you gon na do with one dozen bolt cutters ?	you really want to know ?
why do n't we forget my goddamn psychiatrist and deal with the task at hand . this is important .	your psychiatrist ? did you just say , `` your psychiatrist '' ?
ex-psychiatrist ! now , what about flashlights ? how many flashlights ... ?	that woman is ... was ... your ... psychiatrist ? and now she 's spray- painting our building ?
who cares what psychiatrists write on walls ? you think i told her about the army of the 12 monkeys ? impossible ! know why , you pathetically ineffectual and pusillanimous `` pretend-friend-to- animals '' ? ! i 'll tell you why : because when i had anything to do with her six years ago , there was no such thing -- i had n't even thought of it yet !	then how come she knows what 's going on ?
-- so they get there and they ask the guy real nice for some kind of i.d. , and he gets agitated , starts screaming about viruses . totally irrational , totally disoriented , does n't know where he is , what day it is , alla that stuff . all they got was his name . they figure he 's stoned out of his mind , it 's some kinda psychotic episode , so they 're gon na bring him ...	he 's been tested for drugs ?
you have him in restraints .	were you listening ? we got two officers in the hospital . yeah , he 's in restraints , plus the medic gave him enough stellazine to kill a horse . look at him ! still on his feet .
that would explain the bruises , i guess . the struggle .	you want to go in ? examine him ?
yes , please . you said he gave a name ...	james cole . that 's everything we got . none of the james coles on the computer match him . no license , no prints , no warrants . nothing . you want me to go in with you ?
no , thank you .	i 'll be right here ... just in case .
nine thirty	might be tight .
tight ? my watch says 7:30 .	on your normal mornin ' , okay , plenty a time , but today , got ta take inta account your army-of-the-twelve-monkeys factor .
what ? what did you say ?	twelve monkeys , honey . guess you folks did n't turn on your radio this morning .
hey ! you there !	you want something , old man ?
do n't call me old man . ai n't you got no respect , boy ?	you want something ?
yeah i want something . i want you to run over to that machine and get me a pop .	you ca n't do that yourself ?
hell no , i ca n't do that myself . i 'm blind . ca n't you see that ?	i 'm sorry , i did n't --
what 'd you think i was doing out here with these glasses on ? sunnin ' myself ?	i do n't know . i thought you were keeping the sun from your eyes .
i ai n't got no eyes . you want to see ?	christ no !
lost my eyes on okinawa . lost them fighting the war . fought the war and lost my eyes just so you could come around here and make fun of me .	i said i was sorry .
do n't be sorry . just run over there and get me my pop before i die of thirst .	yeah , sure . you got change ?
change ? you want my change ? i fought the war and lost my eyes just so i could give you my change ?	all right , old man . christ .
get me a dr. peppa ! i do n't want no pepsi . pepsi ai n't nothing but flavored water .	yeah , yeah .
do n't forget to open it for me . i ca n't be opening my own bottle .	christ !
i think you 'd better give your pooch a sip . he looks sick .	that 's 'cause he 's dead .
oh , jesus .	i hope you was n't pettin ' him none , was you ?
what the hell are you keeping a dead dog around for ?	he 's only just dead . what was i supposed to do with him ? i ca n't take him away anywhere . and nobody wants to take him for me . do you ?
he no !	see . ai n't nothing i can do but keep him here beside me . that 's where he belongs anyways . me and jesse , that 's my dog , not anymore , but me and jesse we been pals since the war when i lost my eyes . he was just a pup then . . .
you sure seen a lot for a blind man .	just 'cause i ai n't got eyes does n't mean i ca n't see .
that a fact ?	i can see just fine . for example : you 're a young man who thinks he 's got someplace to be .
maybe i do .	or maybe you just think you do . you can run just as far as you can , but wherever you go , there you are .
i think i 've heard that before .	what do you want for free ?
you sure got a lot of philosophy , old man .	that 's 'cause i 've done a lot of living .
maybe one day i 'll get to sit on a corner and spout wise .	think you 'll live that long ?
ai n't you got a little something for the infirm ?	i 'm a little short . i 'll catch you next time .
the day was n't so bad . we all got through it all right .	ai n't over yet . night is part of day ; separate , but equal . night is when you let your guard down ; when you see things in the shadows and hear things in the dark .
you 're a hell of a pessimist , old man .	night is when you want to sleep , but the dry heat keeps you tossin ' and turnin ' . it 's when you wish the sun was bakin ' high in the sky so you could see what it is you 're afraid of .
you afraid of the dark ?	afraid of it ? boy , i live in the dark . people are afraid of what they ca n't see . i ca n't see nuthin ' , so it 's all the same to me . kiss from a beautiful woman , a lick from a dog . the kiss of death . it 's all the same .
you do n't fear death ?	we was born to die , boy . from the minute you take your first breath you got a death sentence hanging over your head . you just do n't know where , or when , or how . do n't make sense worryin ' about the particulars .
we 're all just floating along like twigs in a stream , so enjoy the ride . is that it ?	more or less .
not this twig , friend . i got plans .	we all got plans . i planned on seeing all my life . i know you did n't plan on straying into town .
no and i do n't plan on sticking around either . i do n't guess i 'll be seeing you again . take it easy .	same back at you .
any parting words of wisdom ?	things ai n't always the way they seem . you got to ask yourself ; is it worth it ?
i 'll take a piece of that bet . i say it does n't come up five times each side .	well , a man with some gumption . how much money you got ?
nothing .	you want to make a kiddies bet ?
it 's a movado .	never heard of it . it 's got no day or date . hell , it ai n't even got numbers . what 's the matter ? you could n't afford a timex ?
thirty-bucks ? that 's it ?	that 's my morning 's pay .
one-hundred-thirteen degrees . that was back in july of forty-seven . now there ai n't no way it 's gon na be hotter than that .	hundred and eight already .
hundred and eight ai n't a hundred and thirteen .	will be .
you ai n't nothing but an old fool .	you got two years on me . what 's that make me ?
it 's nonsense .	it is not .
a coin 's got two sides . when you flip it there 's a fifty-fifty chance it 'll be heads or tails . boyd thinks if you flip a coin ten times half the time it 'll come up each side .	it will .
and what are you ? a rocket scientist ?	i got more brains than you 've got teeth .
can i help you , sir ?	i need a ticket .
where to ?	out of here .
but , in particular ?	i . . . mexico . you got a bus that goes to mexico ? that 's where i have to go .
where in mexico would you like --	i do n't care , just get me there .
we have a bus to mexico . arrives in two hours . have to make a couple of connections , but it will get you across the border .	how much .
one way , or round trip ?	one way .
twenty-seven , fifty . that 's all i got .	the ticket is thirty dollars .
i bought a beer . that was two- fifty . i bought a beer , otherwise i would have thirty .	i 'm sorry , sir . it 's thirty dollars for the ticket .
please , you do n't understand . i have to get out of here . they 're going to come looking for me . they 're going to kill me . if i ca n't get this ticket then i 'm going to have to do things to get out of here . i do n't want to hurt anybody , i just want to leave .	i 'll give you the money ! okay ? i 'll give you two-fifty . just . . . just , please .
you want somethin ' ?	you harlin ?
nope . darrell .	harlin around ?
will he be back soon ?	doubt it . he 's dead . the look out 's a cemetery .
you own this place ?	yep .
then why do you call it harlin 's ?	'cause harlin used to own it .
but he 's dead .	so ?
you want to take a look at my car ? i think the radiator hose is --	damn . gon na be another hot one today .
that 'll make five in a row . never seen it so hot . sometimes i do n't even want to get out of bed . i 'd rather just lay there and try to catch a breeze . i was in mexico this one time --	look , pal , i 've got places to be . could you just take a look at my radiator hose . it 's busted .
it 's your radiator hose . it 's busted .	i know it 's busted . what did i just tell you ?
well , you know so much why do n't you just fix it yourself ?	if i could do you think i 'd be standing here wasting my time . can you fix it , or do i have to go somewhere else ?
somewhere else ? mister somewhere else is fifty miles from here . how you planning on getting it there ? you gon na push this heap yourself ?	okay , i 'm stuck . you happy ? now can you fix it , or not ?
hey !	yeah , i can fix it . got ta run over to the yard and see if i can find a hose like this one , or close enough . gon na take time .
how much time ?	time .
what time is it now ?	twenty-after-ten .
jesus . twenty-after-ten and it must be ninety already .	ninety-two . only gon na get hotter . i remember one time . . .
accident .	you got to be more careful . i remember one time --
yeah , right . someplace in this dust bowl i can get something to drink ?	truck stop up a piece . not much , but us simple folk like it .
i 'll be back in a couple of hours . and be careful with her , will you ?	just a car .
hey .	hey , your . . . what the hell happened to you .
nothing .	do n't look like nothing .
just banged my head . it was an accident .	another accident ? you got to be more careful .
look , i just want to pick up my car .	she 's all yours . put a new hose in it , and she runs like a dream now .
how much ?	well . . . parts , labor . . . let 's call it a hundred-fifty bucks .
how much ! ?	hundred-fifty .
to replace a god damn radiator hose ! ?	a god damn radiator hose in a sixty- four-and-a-half mustang . you know how long it took me to find that hose ?
about an hour and a half , because that 's all the longer i 've been gone .	that 's about an hour and a half longer than i usually spend looking for parts . you 're the one thinks that car 's so damn fancy . what you expect but fancy damn prices ?
that 's a ford , not a ferrari . you going to tell me no one else in this shit hole drives a ford ?	that 's not just a ford , that 's a sixty-four-and-a-half mustang .
what 's that got to do with the radiator hose ?	i do n't know , but it 's the reason i 'm living here and you 're just passing through . now you owe me a hundred-fifty dollars .
it might as well be fifteen-hundred dollars , because i do n't have the money .	then you ai n't gon na have the car .
then you 're only a hundred-forty- five in the hole . now why do n't you just take your visa express silver card , call karl malden and have him send you the money lickity split .	i do n't have a credit card . they took my wallet .
now that 's too bad . i sure hope you know how to wash dishes or shovel shit 'cause you 're gon na have to work this one off .	you son of a bitch !
hey there . i was beginnin ' to think you was n't comin ' back . you do n't look so good .	yeah , well , i 've been around the bend a bit .
one of those days you feel like you been runnin ' in circles and you ai n't no closer to where you tryin ' to get than when you started ?	you 've been there ?
hell , i 've had days i would gladly trade with a whippin ' dog . ai n't much you can do when you feel like that 'cept tough it out .	you believe that ?
you think bad , and bad is what you get .	that 's a good piece of advice , darrell .
no charge .	listen , darrell , about that hundred- fifty bucks for the car , as soon as i get where i 'm going i swear i 'll --
two-hundred .	what ?
it 's going to cost you two-hundred dollars .	you said this morning the hose was going to run me one-fifty .
yep . for the hose . but while you was gone i replaced a gasket . that 's going to run you another fifty .	i did n't tell you to replace any gasket .
yeah , but it was shot .	i did n't tell you to do it ! you ca n't just do unauthorized work .
well , now , you just know all there is about bein ' a mechanic , do n't you ? i ca n't do unauthorized work . i suppose i can just let you ride out of here with a bad gasket . then you get in an accident and get killed . or worse . who they gon na blame then ? they gon na blame me , and there goes my reputation .	what reputation ? you 're nothing but an ignorant , inbred , tumble weed hick .
is that an insult ? are you insulting me .	listen you stupid fuck , i want my car .
take it . as soon as i get my money . fifty dollars for an almost new gasket . you do n't know what kind of a deal you 're getting .	i 'm taking my car , and i 'm taking it now !
no !	what 's the matter ? the fight gone out of you ? i 'm just gon na smash a headlight . maybe two .
please , just leave the car alone .	yeah , you better remember that .
goddamn you ! you son of a bitch !	there you go , sweet talking me again .
what you want ?	open up !
we 're closed . come back in the morning .	it is morning .
what the hell . . . oh it 's you . might 've figured . what do you want ?	i want my car .
two-hundred dollars in hundred- dollar bills . and this morning you was broke .	what 's it to you ?
i do n't want no dirty money . i run an honest business .	honest like al capone on tax day . where are my keys ?
now that you 're so well off , can i get you something , hon ?	you got beer ?
what would a truck stop be without beer ?	let me have a beck 's .
we ai n't got no beck 's .	kirin ?
no , we ai n't got no kirin . we got miller .	genuine draft ?
no . we got miller . regular miller . you want it , or do n't you ?	yeah , give me the miller .
shasta ! now why 'd you go and scare the nice man like that ? sorry about that , hon . enjoy your beer , and try to have a nice day .	yeah , i 'll try .
what was that all about ?	you know how that toby is . thinks every man he sees is after his jenny .
more like jenny is after every man she sees .	you pay toby no mind . he just likes to show off for his girl . give him a couple of hours , he 'll cool off . still want that beer ?
poor thing . is she all right ?	'cept that she lost her money and the sons of bitches stole her wedding ring . that 's when she started shooting . ca n't blame her . the ring was all carlos left her when he died .
lord ! put the baby in the icebox . killed the poor thing .	baby did n't die . just froze off all it 's finger and toes . just a little fingerless , toeless boy now . but the husband ; he sees what the wife 's done , so after he saves the baby he locks the wife in the refrigerator to see how she likes it . now she died .
let me get your change .	flo , i 'm just gon na help myself to a refill on the coffee .
ned ! now look at what you done ! are you all right ?	i think i burned my gun hand !
that yours , mrs. mckenna ?	yes . yes it is .
taking a little trip ?	i had a fight with jake . i . . . i just wanted to get away for awhile . mr. stewart was kind enough to take me as far as montrose . i 'm going to take a bus to my sister 's . i thought i 'd stay with her for a few days .
is that right ? ca n't say as i blame you for wanting to head out for a bit . i know i 've had my fill of this town . sixteen years i 've been the law and order here . so long i forgot why i ever wanted the job in the first place . help people , i guess . keep the peace . problem is there 's so much peace around here they do n't much need me . got a lot of speeders , but they 're speeding through miles of nothing so i ca n't hardly blame them . other than that , well , there ai n't much to steal . i reckon that the last big crime we had was , what would you say mrs. mckenna ? a murder ?	i . . .
i could do that . 'course we 'd have to go back into town . there 'd be a whole crowd of people around when the trunk was opened . a whole crowd of witnesses . that would n't be too pretty , now would it ?	john . . .
is that the way you want it , boy ? a bullet in the head in the middle of the desert ? ends like this and you wo n't be able to spend a dime of that blood money .	he killed him , sheriff ! i could n't stop him ! he made me come with him . he told me if i said a word he would kill me too .
for the love of god would you two give it a rest ? lord almighty . in all my years i have never seen anything so pathetic . how far did you think you were going to get with this ? neither one of you can wait to slit the others throat . now use what little smarts you got . if i was going to bust you i would n't have waited until after you killed jake .	what do you want ?
. . .at the very least . i know there was more than thirty-thousand dollars . now , how much did you get ?	do n't tell him anything . he ca n't do this .
there you go , mrs. mckenna . just put it in there .	john --
that was n't so bad . what 's thirty- some-thousand to rich folks like you ? it did n't hurt a bit .	sheriff potter .
jake . i thought you would be at work , dear .	who the hell is this ! ?
who was that on the phone ?	wrong number .
i put up new drapes , jake .	i know . i was here when your apprentice was helping you . remember ?
you never said anything . about the drapes .	they look nice .
they look nice .	i picked them out for you , jake . i thought you would like the colors .
what the hell you looking at , girl ?	nothing , jake . absolutely nothing .
what 's the matter ?	you did n't hear something ?
how could i ? i was sleeping .	there 's someone in the house .
i do n't hear anything . you were dreaming . or maybe the wind blew something over .	the wind is n't blowing .
jake , what is that ?	what does it look like ?
oh my god , jake , no . if it is someone they 'll go away . or call the police . do n't go out there .	what are you afraid of ? i 'm the one 's got the gun . stay here .
can i give you a hand , beautiful ?	i 'm just going to my car .
my mother told me never to accept offers from strangers .	my name is john . now i 'm not a stranger anymore . see how easy it is for us to get to know each other , beautiful ?
do you have to call me that ?	i do n't know your real name .
maybe i do n't want you to .	maybe , but if you did n't i think you would have kept on walking .
you 're pretty full of yourself , are n't you ?	my cup runneth over , beauti --
it 's grace .	may i carry your package , grace ?
jesus .	you sure you can manage ?
i got it .	do you want me to carry your pack for you ?
no , i 've got it .	what happened to your hand ?
accident .	you should be more careful .
it 's very nice of you to help me . that package is kind of heavy , and it 's so hot .	no trouble at all , really .
was n't nothing .	oh , this is n't my car . it 's down a ways . i should have parked closer . i just did n't think it would be so heavy . i could drive up .
it 's nothing . really .	i just got tired of looking at the old drapes . had them long as i can remember .
that a fact ?	i saw these in the penny 's catalog , and i just knew i had to have them . you ever seen something and just knew you had to have it ?
yes , i have .	'course they cost a little more than i should really be spending . but , damn it , i do n't hardly ever do anything nice for myself . i deserve nice things .
thank you , john .	you 're welcome , grace .
you 're not from around here , are you ?	why you say that ? just because i help a lady with her package ?
you do n't have that dead look in your eyes like the only thing you live for is to get through the day .	i just drove in this morning .
drove into sierra ? what for ?	did n't have a choice . my car overheated up the road .
good luck it did n't happen a few miles back . maybe they never would have found you . day like today you 'd be dead for sure .	yeah , my luck . i get to be stuck out here in this hole in the desert .
least you can leave .	not until my car 's fixed . i do n't know how long that 's going to take .
where you coming from ?	all over . chicago , miami , detroit . just lately albuquerque .
you 've been around .	i guess i 've got wander in my blood .
where you headed ?	i do n't know . i have to make a stop in vegas . business to finish . then maybe i 'll head to santa barbara . i might be able to pick up some work there .
you just travel around , no direction , no steady work . you must like taking chances .	if you 're going to gamble , might as well play for high stakes .
what happens if you lose ?	i pack up and go somewhere else .
somewhere else . i 've never been anywhere else . just once . years ago . went to the state fair . it was nice , but it was n't nothing .	i could n't stay in this place . i would n't . i 'd just pick up , do whatever i had to do , and get out .
that 's good . cools you right off . i saw you watching me .	i 'm sorry . i did n't mean to .
i did n't say it bothered me .	did you like it ; me watching you ?
i guess . i 've got an ego same as any man .	good , 'cause i liked what i saw .
nice place you got here .	thank you .
must get kind of lonely for a woman living by herself in a big house .	i guess it must .
what do you do anyway ?	a little of this , a little of that . mostly i tell fortunes .
where 'd you learn to do that ?	from my father . he was the tribe 's shaman .
a medicine man ?	those are white words , not ours .
nice house for a shaman 's daughter . you must be good .	come here .
my face tell you all that ?	it tells me what every face tells me . everybody has a past , they have a pain , and they have something they want . what is it you want ?
there . all done . lift me down .	what ?
you can let go of me now . i 'm safe . how do they look .	like you .
beautiful ?	like they 're made of polyester .
i like them . i was sick of looking at this room . i think they add a little life .	nothing like a little liveliness .
no more drapes to hang . now what should we do ?	i have ideas .
all right , grace . no more games .	games ?
you flirt with me , then you run cold . you lead me on , then slap me down . i do n't go for being jerked around .	really ? and what game did you want to play ? you carry my box for me , and i fall into bed with you ?
i think i can find my own way back to into town .	maybe i like to find out about a man first . maybe i like to know what he 's made of .
you never did answer my question .	still playing ?
that 's not an answer . what is it you want ?	you know what i want .
damn it , grace ! tell him .	if he says that 's what happened , jake , it must be true .
does n't the heat bother you ?	yeah , but i like the sun . i grew up on a reservation . the sun , the desert ; they were like a religion to us . jake 's the same way . he loves the desert . i guess we 're alike that way . that 's about the only way .
you love him ?	no .
did you ever ?	depends on what you call love . when i was growing up i had nothing . i learned to want everything . i wanted more than sierra anyway . jake was my ticket . he 's not much ; he 's older than me , different than me , but he 's got more money than half this town put together . i courted him . i let him think he was courtin ' me , but i reeled him in like a fish on a line . i wanted him . i wanted what he could give me , and i would 've done anything to get him . is that love ?
i 'm guessing no .	yeah , i guess you 're right .
and i take it things did n't much work out the way you planned .	i 'm still here , are n't i ? see this ?
all this nothing ? i 've spent my life in this stinking desert . it does n't get to jake like it got to me . he does n't mind being out here . he does n't mind being nothing but a land broker . big fish in a small pond , he says . more like a little fish in a dried up watering hole .	you could just leave him .
i do n't know how .	you just walk away .
it 's not that easy . maybe you can take chances ; maybe you can wander around like some stray wherever you please . i ca n't . i do n't want to be alone . i need to know i 'm going to be taken care of .	you need a meal ticket is what you mean . some guy you can latch onto just long enough for him to get you out of here .
is that so bad ? it 's not like i would n't try to make him happy . for awhile , anyway . i mean , i would . . . do things for him . i guess i 'm no good that way . i guess i tried to sucker you along like that . do you hate me for it ? i would n't blame you if you did . but maybe it 's like you said : you just got to do whatever it takes to get out .	whatever it takes .
how far is it to california ?	from here ? i do n't know . far . far enough .
have you ever been there before ?	yeah .
is it pretty ?	beautiful . beautiful beaches . blue water and clear skies as far as you can see .
take me with you .	i ca n't .
please . i wo n't hang on you . as soon as we get there you can dump me . i do n't care . i just want to get out of here .	grace , i ca n't . i ca n't even get out of here myself . i need a hundred-fifty bucks to get my car back from that crazy mechanic .
i know where we could get the money . a lot more than one-hundred-fifty dollars .	where ?
jake .	you think jake 's going to give me money just so i can take you out of here ?
he does n't give it to us . we take it .	from ?
he 's got money . in a floor safe in the living room . i 've never seen it , but he talks about it all the time . more like brags . he loves his money . would n't think of spending some of it on me .	you live pretty good .
yeah , a bird in a gilded cage .	how much money has he got ?
near as i can figure must be about a hundred-thousand .	one-hundred-thousand ! ? that son-of- a-bitch lied to me .
lied ? what do you mean ?	i . . . nothing . just something he said . so if the money 's in a safe we 'd have to get the combination --
it 's not a combination lock . it takes a key . he keeps it on him all the time . i mean all the time . it scratches up against me when we do it .	if the key 's on him , to get the key we 'd have to . . .
john ? john where are you going ?	i think this heat is making me crazy . i was crazy to come back here , i 'm crazy for listening to anyone in this town , and i 'd sure as hell be crazy if i spent another minute in this place .
john , please --	i do n't know what i was thinking , but i ca n't do it .
what are you talking about ?	kill someone . i ca n't do it .
shit !	it 's not like he 's a young man . he 's had time to live .
i thought you would be on your way to vegas by now . is there something you wanted ?	i wanted to talk .
i do n't think we have anything to talk about .	what about us ?
there is no us , remember ?	except i ca n't get you out of my head , grace .
i 've thought about you every second since i left . i can still taste you on my lips .	stop it .
why ? am i making you hot , or does the truth scare you ?	because i know you 're full of shit .
i mean it , grace . i 'm getting out of here , and i want to take you with me .	i thought you could n't leave . i thought you could n't get your car .
i could if i had jake 's money .	is that what changed your mind ? the money ?
i do n't give a damn about the money . i want you , and i want to get us out of this shithole . there 's only one way to do that .	are you sure ? about me , i mean ?
i came back for you ; this morning i came back . before i even knew about the money . you 're what i want .	the only reason i stormed off is because you sort of spooked me talking about jake . but i 've had nothing but time to think about it . it keeps coming back to you and me and us getting the hell out of here . but we 've got to get the money , baby . we get the money , i get the car , then we get the hell out .
you said you could n't kill anybody .	we do n't have to kill him . just knock him out and tie him up 'till we get away .
grace . . . grace ?	after dark . i 'll leave the back door unlocked .
why the hell did n't you do anything ?	what was i supposed to do ?
where 's the safe ?	i do n't know .
you do n't know ? jesus christ ! do n't you think you should have found out before we killed him ?	i 'm not sure where it is . not exactly . i never saw it . i just heard him talk about it .
oh , that 's great . we killed jake because you heard him talk about some money that you 've never seen . that 's fucking brilliant !	do n't yell at me !
nothing . there 's no safe under here .	there has to be !
it 's got to be here . i heard him talk about it . he bragged about it . six steps out , three left .	this is good . this is real good . this is so good they might not even charge us with murder when they catch us . they 'll probably just lock us up for being idiots .
if it is n't here , why would he wear that stupid key ?	you 're calling jake stupid ? you ! ?
there 's easily a hundred-thousand in there . more than that .	i told you . i knew it was there . did n't i tell you ?
if you want .	we 're going all the way . together .
let 's go in the bedroom .	no .
let 's do it here .	what about him ?
you got a suitcase ?	never needed one . i 've never been anywhere . i 've got a backpack .
get it , and put the money in it . pack up anything else you want to take with you .	where are you going ?
to get my car .	wait . what about . . . him ?
john ! ? what the hell 's the matter with you ?	i . . . nothing . i just stubbed my toe on a rock . hurt like hell . . . that 's all .
i got the money all packed . i put the jeep in the garage . figure that way people will think maybe me and jake went away . might buy us some time .	yeah . good thinking .
had push it in . funny thing ; it would n't start .	funny thing .
john . . . ?	grace ! just . . . let me handle this . sheriff , i 'm telling you there 's nothing in that trunk . if that 's not good enough for you , then i 'd be happy to open it . just as soon as you get yourself a search warrant .
sheriff potter , please . i ca n't go to jail . i wanted no part of it .	you liar ! you wanted him dead . you seduced me into killing him !
one-hundred-thousand dollars . a little more .	damn you ! what did you do that for ? he ca n't prove anything .
that 's all talk . he 's got nothing on us . he let you kill jake .	not me . us .
it does n't matter . he was there and he let it happen . he ca n't take us in .	give him the money .
what ?	you heard me . count it out .
he ca n't prove anything , john . he ca n't turn us in .	he can kill us . i do n't know about you , but my life is worth thirty- thousand dollars .
i shot him .	you killed him !
he was going to take the money .	thirty-thousand , that 's all . we would have been free and clear . you did n't have to kill him .
you 're crazy , you know that ! ? you 're fucked up ! ?	just drive .
jesus , grace . did you have to kill him ?	he was going to --
i know . he was to take the fucking money .	you 're tense . what are you all uptight about ?
is that the kind of girl you think i am ? what can i do to make you relax ?	you could give me the gun .
well , nothing .	now what ?
now we dump jake , split the money , then you 're on your own .	but you said we could be together .
are you kidding ? i 'm not going down with you for killing a cop .	what difference does it make ? you killed jake .
< u > we < /u > killed jake . and it 's a big difference . you kill an old man , that 's one thing . nobody cares about an old man . you kill a cop and they never stop looking for you . never .	he was a crooked bastard . he would have killed us .
the police do n't know that . and it 's going to be hard to explain it to them with a noose around your neck . i 'll take you as far as california . if we can even make that . after that i 'm cutting you loose .	but i want to say with you ,
why ? so when the cops catch up with us you can try and sell me out again ? you take your hald of the money and run . you might want to try mexico . with all that dough you 'll live like a queen .	i do n't want to go to mexico , john . i want to be with you . do n't you think i care about you ?
john !	grace !
are you all right ?	i think i busted my leg .
i ca n't make it . grace ? grace ! ?	i 'm here .
grace , listen to me . in the trunk of my car is a rope . it should reach down here . got get it , throw it down and i 'll climb up .	i 'll get it .
john ! can you hear me ? are you still there ?	where the hell am i going to go ?
john , throw me the keys .	what for ?
the trunk . it 's locked .	it 's not locked . i left it open when i took out jake 's body .
it 's . . . it 's locked .	you closed it , did n't you , grace ?
i was going to back the car to the ridge and pull you up .	bullshit , grace . you were going to drive off and leave me here .
no . i swear it .	and you 're not one to lie , are you ?
throw me the keys and i 'll pull you up .	why do n't you come down and get them so i can wring your pretty little neck ?
john , if you do n't throw me the keys , then i 'll just walk away . walk away and leave you here .	walk to where ? we 're fifty miles to the nearest town . it 's going to be over one-hundred degrees today . how far do you think you 're going to get ?
someone will find me .	yeah , they 'll find you . dried up and twice dead .
you idiot ! you 'll kill us both !	at least i 'll have company when i die . ai n't that right , jake ?
for christ 's sake , john ! throw me the keys !	what do you say , jake ? should we trust her ? no ? i did n't think so .
who the hell are you ?	i 'm her husband .
husband . . . ?	now who the hell are you , and it better be good , or god help me i 'll break you in half .
i . . i was helping your wife . i met her in town . she needed a hand with her drapes . that 's all .	did n't much look like you were hanging drapes .
i swear to you that 's all that happened . i have n't so much as set foot in your bedroom .	a lot that means .
i have half a mind to --	is this what it 's all about ? you sucker me up here so you can watch the two of us beat the shit out of each other over you ? forget it . you want to take my head off , mister , i wo n't even try to stop you . i deserve it for being an idiot . but if you 're not , i think i 'll be on my way .
what happened to your hand ?	accident .
you 've got to be --	yeah , i know . more careful .
i guess we 've never been introduced proper . jake mckenna .	jake mckenna . that 's a solid name .
i 'm a solid man .	john stewart .
what brings you to sierra ?	my car overheated . i pulled in to have it fixed .
where you headed ?	i 've got to make a stop in vegas , then i 'm heading to santa barbara .
live there ?	got work . i know a man who 's got a boat . wants me to sail it for him .
you a sailor man ? that 'd be the life . drive across the country , step on a boat and just sail away . a man could pretty well disappear like that . just sail away until all he was was a memory . i guess a little place like this would just be a dot on a map to you after awhile .	i hope so . listen , mr. mckenna , about your wife : if i had known she was married --
it would n't have made a difference to you , now would it ? not a wit . do you know why ? because you 're a man without scruples .	wait a second --
hey !	that 's the sweat of a man who has n't an honest bone in his body . do n't be offended , lad . a man who 's got no ethics is a free man . i envy you that . beside , i can hardly blame you . that grace has a mind of her own , and a body to match , do n't she ? eh ?
she does at that . i knew when i married her she was a free spirit . a woman with her looks and a man my age ; what was i to expect ? but you see a woman like that in a town like this and you do n't think , you do . so , i married her . what are you to do , eh ? women .	ca n't live with them , and you ca n't shoot 'em .
i bet she led you on good , did n't she ? taking you up to the house with that smile of hers . bet she wiggled her ass in your face more than once . then me busting in like some wild bear . bet you had a fire going under you .	like you do n't know .
would you ?	would i what ?
why would i kill her ?	because i 'm sick and tired of her little games . because you could do it and drift away on your boat and no one would ever see you again . because i 've got a fifty-thousand dollar life insurance policy on her , and i would be more than happy to give the man who does her in a good chunk of it .
i 'm not a murderer , mr. mckenna .	how do you know if you 've never tried ?
good lord . what happened to you ?	just ran into a little trouble .
another accident ? you 've really got to be more careful . can i get you a drink ?	no .
hungry ?	no .
i 'm surprised to see you . i thought you 'd be halfway to vegas by now .	i had a problem getting my car back .
nice office you 've got .	i do all right . real estate is n't a bad game such as it is around here . the trick is to underestimate the price when you buy it , and overvalue when you sell . you can turn a few dollars that way .
now what can i do for you ?	i was hoping we could talk .
talk ? about what ?	about things . about your wife .
sweet grace ? what about her ?	about what you said this morning .
you said you had an insurance policy out on your wife . fifty-thousand dollars .	i do .
you said you 'd cut that up with the man who did her in .	i did ?
do n't play simple with me , jake . you want me to spell it out for you ? i 'll kill grace if you cut me in on the money .	i think this heat 's getting to you the way you 're rambling on .
i 'm not rambling .	you 're talking like a mad man .
you 're the one who brought it up . this morning . in your car .	that was just loose talk . i do n't want anybody dead .
bullshit . you wanted me to kill her .	a man does n't always mean the things he says .
you meant it .	what makes you say that ?
because i think you 're a slimy bastard who would have his wife killed just to get his hands on some money .	and what does that make you ?
let 's say i do want her dead . what is it you want ? this morning you were n't a killer .	this morning i did n't know how badly i 'd want to get out of this fucking town .
and for that you 'd kill grace ?	for that i 'd kill a nun on easter sunday .
just to get out of here ? that does n't seem much for a murder .	how do you put a price on murder ?
i put it at fifty-thousand dollars , minus your cut , of course . which is ?	make it twenty .
twenty-thousand ? i do n't have that kind of money . i wo n't get the insurance until months after she 's dead . i do n't imagine you 'll want to be around after poor grace 's demise . twenty-thousand ; that 's more money than i could ever get my hands on .	how much could you get ?
maybe . . . ten-thousand . and that 's a maybe .	i need thirteen .
that 's a bit much .	you 're not buying a car , for christ sake . you 're having your wife killed . i 'm the one who 's neck is stuck out . it 's thirteen , or it 's nothing .
you drive a hard bargain , but i had a feeling you were my boy when i met you .	i 'm not your boy , jake . i do n't like you , and i do n't like what you are . i got no choice but to do business with you . this is just a nasty little marriage of convenience .
do n't say that . i had a marriage of convenience with grace , and look where that 's lead . well , looks like we got ourselves a pact .	do we shake hands ?
i guess i might as well get this done with .	the sooner it 's over , the sooner you 're on your way . now listen to me : it 's got to look like an accident ; that 's the thing . if it does n't , then it 's no good . i wo n't get a dime , and it 's my neck that 'll be on the chopping block while you 're living it up somewhere .
what should i do ?	how the hell should i know ? i 've never had a wife killed before . i guess i should have hired a professional .
you want to do this yourself ? i do n't have to do this , you know .	be quiet , boy . i 'm thinking . it ca n't be done at the house . it should be . . .
this is what you do : go to the house to see her .	and tell her what ?
i went to your place . we talked , just like you told me . we drove out into the desert . . .	is the job done ?
no .	you did n't kill her ?
the time was n't right .	you 're out in the desert , the middle of nowhere with no one around for miles , and you say the time was n't right ? what 's the matter ? you were hoping to get it on home video ? a keepsake for the grandkids . thank god i waited , or i never would have gotten it on tape .
you know what i mean .	i know all right . i know you 're just enough of a shit to have a go at bedding a man 's wife . you 've probably bagged a few at that . you 'd probably lie , cheat and steal without thinking twice . from that you 'd just turn and walk away . but to kill ; to get that blood on your hands . you ca n't wash that off . you 'd be a marked man for life . just like cain . and you 're a sinner who wants to walk with the saints . ai n't that right , boy ?
you know so much about killing why do n't you do it yourself ?	i guess i have what you 'd call a love-hate relationship with grace .
you love her , but you hate her ?	i hate loving her . i hate the kind of her person she is . i hate having to tolerate the little games she plays . i hate letting her use me . but i love her too much to do otherwise . and i certainly love her too much to kill her . i could n't stand to watch her eyes roll back in her head as she sucks her last breath , or to see her pretty pink brains spill from her skull . but you ? you got the killing in you , boy .
shut up .	came close this time and it scares you .
drop it , jake .	and next time , next time somebody is going to get dead .
jake , how much were you going to pay me to do the job ?	thirteen-thousand dollars . had you done it . is n't that what we agreed on ?
you think that 's a lot of money ?	all i have in the world .
maybe not this time , but somebody 's going to get dead around you .	no .
yeah , well , me too .	trouble with the car again ?
you could say . i do n't even have it yet .	darrell giving you problems ?
he did more work on the car . he wants fifty bucks extra for it .	fifty dollars more . that 's a lot of money when you do n't have a dime . and where 'd you plan on getting the money from ? maybe you thought you 'd pay your friend jake mckenna a visit .
it 's not like that .	maybe you heard old jake 's got some money stashed away and you thought you 'd help yourself to a little .
wait a minute . just listen to me --	you thought you 'd come in here in the middle of the night and wham ! wail off and clock old jake mckenna and turn his brains into wall paper .
jake --	and then with jake out of the way you could borrow two-hundred dollars . or maybe two-thousand . or twenty-thousand . who 's to stop you ? not jake mckenna , 'cause old jake would be dead .
that 's not the reason i 'm here . i swear it .	there 's another reason ? it better be good .
i came for grace .	you came to take my wife from me ?
i came to kill her .	liar .
it 's the truth , jake .	that 's a thick change of heart .
yeah , well , a couple of hours ago i just about killed some guy over a girl . not for money , for a girl . and she was just going to stand there and let it happen , or let him kill me . same way grace played us this morning . i do n't like that , jake . not twice in one day . and maybe i 'm so pissed i 'd twist the next off my own grandma to get out of here .	that 's a lot of talk . a whole lot of talk .
i 'm curious about something . i 'm wondering just how it is you happen to know where the bedroom 's at .	wh . . . what are you talking about ?
this morning when i came in on you and grace , you swore you had n't so much as been near the bedroom . now you make straight for it .	come on , jake --
do n't jake me , boy ! it 's a big house . odd that you would know your way , except maybe you 've been in the bedroom before . maybe with grace to keep you company .	nothing happened with me and grace this morning .
then maybe this afternoon . when i sent you to kill my wife you ended up sexing her instead .	christ , jake , please --
is that what happened ? did you even make it out to the desert , or did you just ply the afternoon between my sheets ?	you 're not talking sense .
sense ? if i had any sense i would have killed you this morning and been done with it .	what are you . . . you ca n't . . . you ca n't kill me .
a drifter , a loner , a trouble maker like you ? just passing through town , need money so he busts in on an , old man . only this old man 's got himself an automatic , and he knows how to use it . a man 's got to protect his home . his wife . you 're dead , boy , and your own mother would n't convict me .	what difference does it make if i slept with her . you do n't care about grace .
you 're right . i do n't give a damn about her . but to fuck a man 's wife behind his back ? that just makes a fool out of him . i do n't like being made a fool of .	i do n't blame you . what man would ? i admit it , okay ? i came back here and i made it with grace . but if you kill me you 're making a big mistake .
not from where i stand .	it 's not me you have to worry about . it 's her . she wants you dead , jake . she wants you dead and she wants your money .
what are you babbling about ?	think about it . how do you think i got in here ? did you hear any glass break ? did you hear a door splinter ? how did the evening end ? after you went to bed did she linger a bit ? maybe just long enough to leave the back door unlocked ? is that what happened ?
you 'd tell me anything to save your pathetic life .	you know what kind of woman grace is . you know how badly she wants to get the fuck out of sierra . what makes you think when you were planning on killing her she was n't doing the same for you ? what 's she to you , jake ; a woman who would have you dead ? let me kill her . all i want is two-hundred dollars to get out of here with .
two-hundred dollars .	two-hundred dollars . . . that 's how i put a price on murder .
i asked you a question .	aw , toby , we were n't doing nothing . we was just talking .
honest , toby . i just asked him for a quarter for the jukebox .	stay out of this , jenny . we got man 's business to take care of .
i want to stay .	i said come on !
toby ! toby tyler , leave him alone !	you stay away , jenny . i aim to mess him up , and that ai n't a thing for a woman to see .
hey , mister . you got ta quarter ?	what ?
what happened to your hand ?	accident , and yeah , i got to be more careful .
got any requests ?	that country shit all sounds the same to me .
you like patsy cline ? i just love her . how come , i wonder , she do n't put out no more new records .	she 's dead .
gee , that 's sad . do n't that make you sad ?	i 've had time to get over it .
you 're not from around here , are you ? where you from ?	oz .
you ai n't from oz . oz is in that one movie .	you 're too quick for me .
hey , mister . mister . i just . . . i just wanted to thank you .	for what ?
for defending my honor this afternoon .	i hate to bust your bubble , but i was n't defending you .
but you was going to fight for me .	i was n't going to fight for you . i was just going to beat the shit out of your boyfriend .
he 's not my boyfriend . i mean , i let him take me out and stuff , but i ai n't spoken for . not yet that is .	get it through your head , little girl ; i 'm not going for you . if this toby likes you , then if i were you i 'd marry him . you 're not going to get much better in this town .
that 's what i thought until you came riding in . i saw your car over at the gas station . it 's cool . want to take me for a ride ? desert 's kind of lonely this time of day .	how old are you ?
eighteen . well , i 'm gon na be eighteen in two years , but that do n't mean you ca n't take me for a ride if you want .	no , i do n't want to take you for a ride . what i want is for . . . hey , you do n't happen to have a hundred and fifty dollars i could --
you 're too late , toby . we 're going to get in his fancy car and ride off and leave you behind .	what the hell are you talking about ?
toby tyler , it do n't matter to me if you beat him all up and knock out all his teeth and he 's just drooling and bleeding all over hisself , 'cause we love each other and we gon na run off , and i 'm gon na have his love child .	will you shut up !
do n't be afraid of him none . i do n't care what he does to you , we can still be together .	get away from me !
i was n't doing anything .	that 's not the way it looked to me . looked to me like you was trying to make time with her .
look , pal , i was n't making a play for your girl .	you expect me to believe that ?
i do n't care what you believe as long as you leave me alone .	mister , i 'm calling you out .
you 're fucked .	you know who i am ? toby n. tyler . my friends call me tnt . you know why ?
they 're not very imaginative ?	'cause i 'm just like dynamite . and when i go off somebody gets hurt .
fine . i was making time with your girl . now i 'm all scared , and i 'll never make that mistake again . now go away .	not before i settle with you .
christ , i do n't believe this .	stand up .
i was n't hitting on your girl !	stand up , mister , or i 'll beat you where you sit .
mister !	oh , shit !
that 's right , mister . you better be afraid . i told you it was n't over , but you did n't listen . now i find you sneakin ' around with my girl behind my back .	i was n't sneaking around with your girl . would you please tell him ?
oh , that tears it , mister . i 'm gon na bust you up but good . i 'm gon na bust you into a million pieces and then . . . and then bust those pieces up , and then . . . and then spread them all around . that 's what i 'm gon na do . you do n't know what you 're dealing with , mister . i 'm crazy . i 'm psycho crazy .	yeah , i know . you 're tnt . just like dynamite . when you go off somebody gets hurt . all right . let 's do this .
get up , mister ! do n't ever let it be said toby tyler beat the living shit out of someone without giving them a fair chance .	what the hell are you doing ? are you crazy ?
i 'm doing what any man would do if he 'd been offended . i 'm beating you up .	you stupid punk ! you do n't even know what you 're fighting over !
now , what 's this ?	give it to me !
mexico ? you 're going to mexico ?	i 'm leaving . you never have to see me again . just please , give me the ticket !
nooo !	i 'm gon na beat you so bad you gon na be eatin ' nothing but soup the rest of your days . rain dogs is gon na be prettier than you when i 'm done . i 'm gon na mess you up so bad you gon na make your own momma sick . i 'm gon na . . .
john , what a surprise . i expected to be seeing you , not talking to you over the phone .	i know , mr. vesci . i know . i was on my way to you , it 's just . . . what a day i 've had . you 're not going to believe what 's happened to me . i had the money , i swear i had it . i was on my way to you when my car breaks down in the middle of nowhere .
that 's a shame , john . a real shame .	you do n't know the how , mr. vesci . and that 's not the half of it . i 've got your money , and i go into this little grocery store to get something to eat and it gets robbed .
let me guess . this robber ; he gets your money .	no . he gets shot by the old lady .
the old lady ?	with a shotgun . it kills him , and it shreads the money . i mean , what are the odds ?
you 're the gambler . you tell me .	i had to beat it before the cops showed up . i do n't have a cent to my name . i ca n't even get my car out of the garage . i tell you , mr. vesci , if it were n't for bad luck i would n't have any at all . so , i was wondering if you could wire me a hundred fifty-dollars so i could get my car . i 'll pay it back with the rest of the money .
let me get this straight : you owe me thirteen-thousand dollars , you call me - collect - then ask me to wire you one-hundred-fifty dollars just so you can get your car fixed .	a hundred-forty-five really .
do you understand me you little fuck ?	yes , mr. vesci .
fucking kid . and look at you ; breaking fucking pencils . you 're a neanderthal .	hello ? hello ! ? operator , i got disconnected . hello . . .
kids .	yeah . what are you going to do ? that toby 's a hot head .
he is at that . no so much a fault of his own . poor boy had quite a trauma as a child .	what happened ?
his father worked in a strip mine north of here . toby 's school class went up to the mine one day . school takes field trips up there every year . big day for the kids when they can see ore tore up out of the ground . anyway , on this particular day toby 's dad up and falls into the machinery .	jesus !
yep . tore him up good and spat out little , refined pieces of him . nothing like the embarrassment of having your father refined in front of your classmates to put the anger in a young man .	i guess .
saw you at the truck stop this morning . you 're not from around here .	no , sir . and i 'm not going to be around long if that 's what you 're worried about .
just curious . that 's a nasty cut you 've got .	not as bad as it looks .
there was a young man over at jamilla 's today when it got hit . way she tells it he got whacked around by one of the robbers .	would n't know anything about it .
that 's too bad . i was hoping you were there . maybe you could help us catch the guy who got away . or maybe you could explain about all that money that got tore up when jamilla shot that biker .	wish i could help , sheriff . but if you 'll excuse me i 'm going over to harlin 's to pick up my car . then i 'm getting the hell out of this place .
stay as long as you like , son . no rush .	maybe not for you , sheriff , but i think i 've had my fill of your little town .
nice night for a drive . morning really . i guess that 's about the only way to keep cool ; riding around with the top down on a fancy convertible in the first hours of the day .	not taking a drive , sheriff . heading out of town .
suppose you 've had all you can of sierra . what with that ruckus you had with toby . oh yes , i heard all about that .	sheriff , he did n't give me any choice . if i had n't defended myself- -
just cool down , son . i ai n't accusing you of anything . serves toby right to get his ass whooped . if you had n't done it , somebody else would 've .	is there a problem up the road , sheriff ?
why do n't you step out of the car , son ?	i do n't understand what the --
just step from the car . nice and slow .	sure , sheriff .
now step around to the back of the car and open the trunk for me .	what for ?
i think you might just want to do as i say .	there 's nothing in the trunk , sheriff .
you bitch ! you were in on it froom the start !	shut up ! the both of you . ai n't neither one of you too smart . especially you , boy . do n't you think i had my eye on you since first you rolled into town ? you smell like trouble . stink of it like a ripe cesspool .
i did n't do anything .	killing jake mckenna 's got to amount to something . he was n't much of a man , but that do n't give you the right to murder him . and do n't tell me you did n't , 'cause i know you did . i was there . like i said ; i been watching you .
that 's what this is all about ? a shakedown ? you picked the wrong people . we do n't have any money .	sure you do . everybody in town knows about the money jake kept hid in the house . it 's a wonder the mrs. here just now got round to killing him . not for lack of trying .
what 'd you think , boy ? that you were the first man to drift through this town she came on to ? not by a long shot . you 're just the most gullible . how much did you get ?	thirty-thousand dollars .
nobody 's going to hang . we 're all gon na walk away with a little something . i ai n't a greedy man . and , hell , you did all the work . one-hundred-thousand dollars . split that three ways and it comes out to about thirty-three thousand . give or take .	and you 're taking ?
got any cold soda ?	eh ?
soda . you got any soda ?	hablar slowly , por favor . my ingles no es bien .
i call the policia .	no !
no police .	but , senor --
no police ! wait until i 'm gone .	senor , you need a doctor .
hey ! you there !	you want something , old man ?
do n't call me old man . ai n't you got no respect , boy ?	you want something ?
yeah i want something . i want you to run over to that machine and get me a pop .	you ca n't do that yourself ?
hell no , i ca n't do that myself . i 'm blind . ca n't you see that ?	i 'm sorry , i did n't --
what 'd you think i was doing out here with these glasses on ? sunnin ' myself ?	i do n't know . i thought you were keeping the sun out of your eyes .
i ai n't got no eyes . you want to see ?	christ no !
lost my eyes in vyee-et-nam . lost them fighting the commies . fought the war and lost my eyes fightin ' the commies just so you can come around here and make fun of me .	i said i was sorry .
do n't be sorry . just run over there and get me my pop before i die of thirst .	yeah , sure . you got change ?
change ? you want my change ? i fought the war and lost my eyes just so i could give you my change ?	all right , old man . christ .
do n't forget to open it for me . i ca n't be opening my own bottle .	christ !
i think you 'd better give your pooch a sip . he looks sick .	that 's 'cause he 's dead .
oh , jesus .	i hope you was n't pettin ' him none , was you ?
what the hell are you keeping a dead dog around for ?	he 's only just dead . what was i supposed to do with him ? i ca n't take him away anywhere . and nobody wants to take him for me . do you ?
hell no !	see . ai n't nothing i can do but keep him here beside me . that 's where he belongs anyways . me and jesse , that 's my dog , not anymore , but me and jesse we been pals since the war when i lost my eyes . he was just a pup then ... a companion that 's loyal , that 'll keep coming back to you no matter how much you kick him ... i miss him . i 'll see ya later , unless i come across something worse .
you sure seen a lot for a blind man .	just 'cause i ai n't got eyes does n't mean i ca n't see .
maybe i do .	or maybe you just think you do . just another small town . one guy chasing you . you go big town . just gon na have four guys after you instead . kiss kissy kiss . it gets down to one thing -- are you a human being or are you one of those hungry ghosts out there never satisfied with nothing ? cause you got ta remember you can run just as far as you can , but wherever you go , that 's where you gon na be .
i think i 've heard that before .	what do you want for free ?
you sure got a lot of philosophy , old man .	seems like i do but only cause end of the day we 're all eyes in the same head . and everything is everything .
what ?	... and everything is nothing too .
cocksucker motherfucker ! cops . i hear you . always sneaking around . thinks i ca n't see him . well he 's right . motherfucker . but that ai n't mean i do n't know what 's going on around here . they 're all cursed . yes sir .	who 's cursed ?
i thought you said you lost your eyes in the war ?	so now you 're going to tell me where i lost my eyes . you do n't think i know where i lost my eyes ? i was there when i lost them . i lost them in the war . the war in the joint . there 's always wars in the joint . cause i was a code talker in the joint and in the war too . mmmm , nothing like the smell of a naked lady . be careful , boy .
musta been some bad ass nuclear tests here in the 50 's . this town 's all inbreeding .	well , people got ta get by somehow . that 's the curse . the mines done it . all that uranium , plutonium , fuffonium , fuckononium , assononium , all that `` om '' ! everybody 's got a mother . you do n't rip up your mother . you do n't rip up the earth and take everything out . it 's like the cracker jack box says , `` the more you eat , the more you want ... . '' ...
... but ai n't you got a little something for the infirm ?	i 'm a little short pops . i 'll catch you next time .
ai n't over yet . night is part of day ; separate , but equal . night is when you let your guard down ; when you see things in the shadows and hear things in the dark .	difference between you and me , old man , is i see the glass half full , you see it half empty .
night is when you want to sleep , but the dry heat keeps you tossin ' and turnin ' . it 's when you wish the sun was bakin ' high in the sky so you could see what it is you 're afraid of .	you afraid of the dark ?
afraid of it ? boy , i live in the dark . all cause of a woman who made me this way . people are afraid of what they ca n't see . i ca n't see nuthin ' , so it 's all the same to me . kiss from a beautiful woman , kissy kissy kiss , a lick from a dog , slurp , slurp , the kiss of death . it 's all the same to me .	so , we 're all just floating along like twigs in a stream , so enjoy the ride . is that it ?
more or less .	not this twig , friend . i got plans .
nothing makes the great spirit laugh harder than a man 's plans . we all got plans . i planned on seeing all my life . i know you did n't plan on straying into town .	no and i do n't plan on sticking around either .
well , do n't say i did n't warn you when things go your way .	you got a lotta philosophy in you , old timer but you do n't fool me for one second with all this blind man crap . one minute you lost your eyes in vietnam , next it 's the joint . now it 's a woman ? i 'm hep to you .
time 's up . any last words of wisdom ?	things ai n't always the way they seem . you got to ask yourself : is it worth it ? day comes earthmaker is going to look in your fucking heart ! then you better know what it is you 're doing . < u > are you a human being < /u > -- or just one of them hungry ghosts out there floatin ' around ?
you < u > are < /u > crazy , you know . be seeing you , old man .	you know i wo n't be seeing you .
i was n't doing anything .	that 's not the way it looked to me . looked to me like you was trying to make time with her .
then maybe you should 've . look , pal , i was n't making a play for your girl .	you expect me to believe that ?
i do n't care what you believe as long as you leave me alone .	mister , i 'm calling you out .
let 's see ... they 're not very imaginative ?	'cause i 'm just like dynamite . and when i go off , somebody gets hurt .
fine . i was making time with your girl . now i 'm scared to death and i learned my lesson . now can you go away ?	not before i settle with you , chickenshit !
christ , i do n't believe this !	stand up .
i was n't hitting on your girl !	stand up , mister , or i 'll beat you where you sit .
mister !	oh , shit !
that 's right , mister . you better be afraid . i told you it was n't over , but you did n't listen . now i find you sneakin ' around with my girl behind my back .	i was n't sneaking around with your girl . would you please tell him ?
oh , that tears it , mister . i 'm gon na bust you up but good . i 'm gon na bust you into a million pieces and then ... and then bust those pieces up , and then ... and then spread them all around . that 's what i 'm gon na do . you do n't know what you 're dealing with , mister . i 'm crazy . i 'm psycho crazy .	yeah , i know . you 're tnt . just like dynamite . when you go off somebody gets hurt . all right . let 's do this .
i 'm doing what any man would do if he 'd been offended . i 'm stompin ' your ass .	you idiot ! you do n't even know what you 're fighting over !
now , what 's this ?	give it to me !
mexico ? you going to mexico ?	i 'm leaving . you never have to see me again . just please , give me the ticket !
who the hell is this ! ?	who the hell are you ?
now who the hell are you , and it better be good , or god help me i 'll break you in half .	easy , chief . i ... i was helping your wife . i met her in town . she needed a hand with her drapes . that 's all .
did n't much look like you were hanging drapes .	i swear to you that 's all that happened . i have n't so much as set foot in your bedroom .
a lot that means .	grace , tell him .
you ca n't just walk in here and walk out , you sonufabitch ! i 'm gon na tear you a new asshole !	you broke my nose !
what the fuck do you want ?	i 'll give you a lift , son . too hot to be walking ... people die out here , y'know .
after you huffed off , grace lied so bad , i got so pissed off , i pulled down her pants to paddle her ass raw and finger-fucked it instead . sorry i lost my cool like that . it 's a funny thing , women .	yeah ...
say , what happened to your hand ?	accident .
you 've got to be --	yeah , i know . more careful .
i guess we 've never been introduced proper . jake mckenna .	that 's a solid name .
i 'm a solid man .	bobby cooper .
`` bobby cooper . '' what brings you to superior , coop ?	an overheated car .
oh ? darrell taking good care of you ?	darrell 's a moron .
california ...	live there ?
got work . i know a man who 's got a boat . wants me to sail it for him .	you a sailor man ? that 'd be the life . drive across the country , step on a boat and just sail away . a man could pretty well disappear like that . just sail away until all he was was a memory . i guess a little place like this would just be a dot on a map to you after awhile .
i hope so . listen , mckenna about your wife : if i had known she was married --	it would n't have made a difference to you , now would it ? not a wit . do you know why ? because you 're a man without scruples .
wait a second --	ah , i can smell it on you .
hey !	that 's the sweat of a man who has n't an honest bone in his body . do n't be offended , lad . a man who 's got no ethics is a free man . i envy that . beside , how can i blame you ? that grace sure has a mind of her own , and a body to match , do n't she ? eh ?
she does at that . i knew when i married her she was a free spirit . a woman with her looks and a man my age ; what was i to expect ? but you see a woman like that in a town like this and you do n't think , you do . so , i married her . what are you to do , eh ? women .	ca n't live with them , and you ca n't shoot 'em .
`` you ca n't shoot 'em ! '' i like that . i bet she led you on good , did n't she ? taking you up to the house to hang drapes . oh that 's a good one . bet she had you hard as a rock wiggling her ass in your face . i bet you just wanted to pull down her pants and hog her out . then me busting in like some wild bear . ha ! bet you had a fire going under you .	like you do n't know .
would you ?	would i what ?
i 've done a few things but i 'm not a murderer , mr. mckenna .	how do you know if you 've never tried ?
what can i do for you , lad ?	i was hoping we could talk .
talk ? about what ?	about things . about your wife .
sweet grace ? what about her ?	about what you said this morning .
you said you had an insurance policy out on your wife . fifty-thousand dollars .	i do .
you said you 'd cut that up with the man who did her in .	i did ?
do n't play simple with me , jake . you 're a betting man . you want me to spell it out for you ? i 'll kill grace if you cut me in on the money .	boy i think this heat 's getting to you the way you 're rambling on .
i 'm not rambling .	you 're talking like a madman .
well then , i guess that qualifies me for citizenship in this town . you 're the one brought it up . this morning . in your car .	oh , that was just loose talk . husband gettin ' pissed off . i do n't want anybody dead .
bullshit . you wanted me to kill her .	a man does n't always mean the things he says .
you meant it .	what makes you say that ?
because you 're a slimy bastard who would have his wife killed just to get his hands on some money .	and what does that make you ?
well , i guess i have what you call a love-hate relationship with grace .	you love her , but you hate her ?
how much could you get ?	maybe ... ten-thousand . and that 's a maybe .
i need thirteen .	that 's a bit much .
you drive a hard bargain , but i had a feeling you were my boy when i met you .	i 'm not your boy . i do n't like you . i got no choice but to do business with you . let 's just call this a nasty little marriage of convenience .
if you ca n't trust the man you 've hired to kill your wife ... ? the thing is it 's got to look like an accident ; that 's the thing . if it does n't , then it 's no good . i wo n't get a dime , and it 's my neck that 'll be on the chopping block while you 're living it up somewhere .	how do you want it ?
how the hell should i know ? i 've never had a wife killed before . jesus christ ! < u > you < /u > want this job , you do n't know how to do this ? i guess i should have hired a professional .	you want to do this yourself ? i do n't have to do this , you know .
come to think of it , how 'bout some money upfront ?	oh yeah sure . why do n't i buy you a plane ticket right out of here while i 'm at it . i < u > know you < /u > ... this is what you do : go to the house to see her .
... i do n't know . tell her you had to see her . tell her you do n't care if she 's married or not , you had to be with her . sweet talk the woman . a young buck like you must be good at that . then ... maybe shift the conversation . get her thinking about that jeep of hers . she loves that thing . maybe the only thing she does love . she 'll want to take you for a ride .	i know you 're not surprised i 'm back here , cause you can read my mind and all .
next time you 'll do just fine .	no !
that 's my gun ... that fucking darrell !	i like darrell . he may be an idiot , but he 's my half brother . we own harlin 's together , yeah , that little redneck manages to get paid no matter how things work out .
i guess this is what they call `` ironee '' ? hunh ?	it 's not what you think , jake .
no , but it do n't matter anyway when you 're lying there with your brains all over my carpet and i 'm telling sheriff potter about this drifter , did n't have enough money to fix his car . and darrell happened to find his gun , and through maybe this drifter heard old jake got some money stashed away , and figgered he might try to break in and steal it !	wait a minute . just listen to me ...
i came for grace .	you came to take my wife from me ?
shhh ! liar .	it 's the truth , jake .
that 's a thick change of heart from this afternoon .	maybe i do n't like being played , like she played us today . maybe i do n't like that at all , jake . i 'm just pissed enough , maybe i 'll rip the neck off my own grandmother .
you have a lot of talk in you , whole lot of talk .	damn it , jake . there is a guy coming to kill me , and if it comes down to me or grace , then i pick grace . you were going to give me thirteen-thousand . give me two-hundred . i 'll kill her and dump the body where no one will ever find it . she showed me the perfect place . there wo n't be enough left for an autopsy . but i need the the money . i 've got to have the money .
how the hell did you know where the bedroom 's at ?	what are you talking about !
come on , jake --	do n't jake me boy ! it 's a big house . you probably did n't even make it out to the desert this afternoon ...
you 'd tell me anything to save your pathetic life .	you know what kind of woman grace is , jake . you know how badly she wants to get the fuck out of superior . what 's she to you , jake ; a woman who wants you dead ? let me kill her . all i want is two-hundred dollars to get out of here with .
two-hundred dollars ?	two-hundred dollars ... i 'll do it ! i 'll kill her !
hey , mister . you got ta quarter for the juke ?	what ?
what happened to your hand ?	i cut it shaving ; i know , i got ta be more careful .
got any requests ?	that country shit all sounds the same to me .
you like patsy cline ? i just love her . how come , i wonder , she do n't put out no more new records .	cause she 's dead .
gee , that 's sad . do n't that make you sad ?	i 've had time to get over it .
you 're not from around here , are you ? where you from ?	oz .
you ai n't from oz . oz is in that movie .	you 're too quick for me .
hey mister . mister , i just ... i just wanted to thank you .	for what ?
for defending my honor this afternoon .	i hate to bust your bubble honey , but i was n't defending you .
but you was going to fight for me .	i was n't going to fight for you . i was just going to beat the shit out of your boyfriend .
he 's not my boyfriend . i mean , i let him take me out and stuff , but i ai n't spoken for . not yet that is .	get it through your head , little girl ; i 'm not going for you . if this toby likes you , then if i were you i 'd marry him . you 're not going to get much better in this town .
that 's what i thought until you came riding in . i saw your car over at the gas station . it 's a cool car . want to take me for a ride ? desert 's kind of lonely this time of day .	how old are you ?
eighteen ... well , i 'm gon na be eighteen in two years , but that do n't mean you ca n't take me for a ride if you want .	no , i do n't want to take you for a ride . what i want is for ... hey , you do n't think you can get $ 150 from your parents , could you ?
you 're too late , toby . we 're going to get in his fancy car and ride off and leave you behind .	what the hell are you talking about ?
toby tucker , it do n't matter to me if you beat him all up and knock out all his teeth and he 's just drooling and bleeding all over hisself , 'cause we love each other and we gon na run off , and i 'm gon na have his love child .	will you shut up !
do n't be afraid of him none . i do n't care what he does to you , we can still be together .	get away from me !
you harlin ?	nope . darrell .
harlin around ?	he 's up at the look out .
will he be back soon ?	doubt it . he 's dead . the look out 's a cemetery .
you own this place ?	yep .
then why do you call it harlin 's ?	'cause harlin used to own it .
but he 's dead .	so ?
you want to take a look at my car ? i think the radiator hose is --	damn . gon na be another hot one today . sometimes i do n't even want to get out of bed . course do n't want to get out for the cold one 's neither . then of course the clouds come in ...
look , harlin , i 've got places to be .	darrell --
so ?	it 's your radiator hose . it 's busted .
i know it 's busted . what did i just tell you ?	well , you know so much why do n't you just fix it yourself ?
if i could do you think i 'd be standing here wasting my time . can you fix it , or do i have to go somewhere else ?	somewhere else ? mister , somewhere else is fifty miles from here . only other gas station down in town closed 3 years ago when the mine got shut ...
okay , i 'm stuck . you happy ? now can you fix it , or not ?	yeah , i can fix it .
great !	got ta run over to the yard and see if i can find a hose like this one , or close enough . gon na take time .
how much time ?	time .
twenty-after-ten .	jesus . twenty-after-ten and it must be ninety already .
accident .	you got to be more careful . hands is important . let me show you something . when i was a kid , now i do n't know if you can still see it , but i gashed my fingers in a lawnmower .
i 'm very interested in this but is there someplace ...	diner up a piece . not much , but us simple folk like it .
hey .	hey , your ... what the hell happened to you ?
nothing .	do n't look like nothing .
just banged my head . it was an accident .	another accident ? you got to be more careful .
what the hell happened to my car ?	bottom hose was shot too . rotted clear through . had to put a new one in . runs like a dream now .
well ... you got your parts , you got your labour ... let 's call it a hundred-fifty bucks .	how much ! ?
hundred-fifty .	to replace a goddamn radiator hose ! ?
a goddamn radiator hose in a sixty-four-and-a-half mustang . you know how long it took me to find that hose ?	about an hour and a half , because that 's all the longer i 've been gone .
actually , it 's been about three hours . you 're the one thinks that car 's so damn fancy . what you expect but fancy damn prices ?	that 's a ford , not a ferrari . you going to tell me no one else in this shit hole drives a ford ?
`` that 's not just a ford , that 's a sixty-four-and-a-half mustang . ''	what 's that got to do with the radiator hose ?
i do n't know , but `` it 's the reason i 'm living here and you 're just passing through . '' now you owe me a hundred-fifty dollars .	it might as well be fifteen-hundred dollars , because i do n't have the money .
then you ai n't gon na have the car .	listen , man . i got rolled half an hour ago for everything i had .
then you 're only a hundred-forty-five in the hole . you can keep that dollar . now why do n't you just take your american express gold card , and call that guy with the big schnooz on tv and have him send you the money lickity split .	i do n't have a goddamn credit card .
... got no day , got no date . probably ai n't worth a duck 's fart . this one here cost me $ 3.75 and it 's got every doodad you can imagine . no sir i 'll stick with this .	you son of a bitch ! i 'll have my lawyers shut you down .
you ai n't got no credit card but you got a lawyer . sweet talk me all you want . did n't you read the sign ? it says ...	what sign ? fuck the sign . i want my car .
hey there . i was beginnin ' to think you was n't comin ' back ... you do n't look so good .	yeah , well , i 've been around the bend a bit .
one of those days you feel like you been runnin ' in circles and you ai n't no closer to where you tryin ' to get than when you started ?	you 've been there ?
hell , i 've had days i would gladly trade with a whippin ' dog . ai n't much you can do when you feel like that 'cept tough it out .	you believe that ?
you think bad , and bad is what you get .	that 's a good piece of advice , darrell .
no charge .	listen , darrell , about that hundred-fifty bucks for the car , as soon as i get where i 'm going i swear i 'll --
two-hundred .	what ?
it 's going to cost you two-hundred dollars .	you said this morning the hose was going to run me one-fifty .
yep . for the hose . but while you was gone i replaced a gasket . that 's going to run you another fifty .	i did n't tell you to replace any gasket .
yeah , but it was shot .	i do n't give a fuck ! i did n't tell you to do it ! you ca n't just do unauthorized work .
well , now , you just know all there is about bein ' a mechanic , do n't you ? did n't you read the sign .	what sign ?
the goddamn sign on the wall . i ca n't do unauthorized work ? what am i suppose to do ? just let you ride out of here with a bad gasket . then you get in an accident and get killed . or worse . who they gon na blame then ? they gon na blame me , and there goes my reputation .	what reputation ? you 're nothing but an ignorant , inbred , tumbleweed hick .
is that an insult ? are you insulting me .	listen you stupid fuck , i want my car .

i call the sheriff .	no ! no police .
can i give you a hand , beautiful ?	i 'm just going to my car ?
that 's right on my way .	my mother told me never to accept offers from strangers .
my name is bobby . now i 'm not a stranger anymore . see how easy it is for us to get to know each other , beautiful ?	do you have to call me that ?
i do n't know your real name .	maybe i do n't want you to .
maybe , but if you did n't i think you would have kept on walking .	you 're pretty full of yourself , are n't you ?
i like that about me , beautiful .	it 's grace .
jesus .	you sure you can manage ?
i got it .	do you want me to carry your pack for you ?
no , i 've got it .	what happened to your hand ?
accident .	you should be more careful .
it 's very nice of you to help me . that package is kind of heavy , and it 's so hot .	no trouble at all , really .
was n't nothing .	oh , this is n't my car . it 's down a ways . i should have parked closer . i just did n't think it would be so heavy . i could drive up .
thank you , bobby .	you 're welcome , grace .
you 're not from around here , are you ?	why you say that ? just because i help a lady with her package ?
you do n't have that dead look in your eyes like the only thing you live for is to get through the day .	i just drove in this morning .
drove into superior ? what for ?	did n't have a choice . my car overheated up the road .
you 're lucky you did n't break down in the desert . day like today , you 'd be dead in no time . when you leaving ?	not until my car 's fixed . i do n't know how long that 's going to take .
where you coming from ?	all over . chicago , houston , detroit . just lately dallas .
you 've been around .	i guess i 've got wander in my blood .
where you headed ?	i do n't know . i have to make a stop in vegas . business to finish . then maybe i 'll head to santa barbara . i might be able to pick up some action there .
so , what is it you do , mister ... ?	cooper . bobby cooper . oh you know , whatever pays best . little bartending , used to teach tennis , played a little competition ... .
i never played tennis . you just travel around bobby -- no direction , no steady work . you must like taking chances .	if you 're going to gamble , might as well play for high stakes .
what happens when you lose ?	i pack up and go somewhere else .
that 's good . cools you right off . i saw you watching me .	i 'm sorry . i did n't mean to .
i did n't say it bothered me .	did you like it ; me watching you ?
i guess . i 've got an ego same as any man .	good , 'cause i liked what i saw .
nice place .	thank you .
must get kind of lonely for a woman living by herself in a big house .	i guess it must .
what do you do anyway ?	a little of this , a little of that . mostly i tell fortunes .
where 'd you learn to do that ?	from my father . he was the tribe 's shaman .
a medicine man ?	those are white words , not ours .
nice house for a shaman 's daughter . you must be good .	come here .
my face tell you all that ?	it tells me what every face tells me . everybody has a past , they have a pain , and they have something they want . what is it you want ?
there . all done . lift me down .	what ?
you can let go of me now . i 'm safe . how do they look ?	like you .
i like them . i was sick of looking at this room . i think they add a little life .	nothing like a little liveliness .
no more drapes to hang . now what should we do ?	i have an idea .
you flirt with me , then you run cold . you lead me on , then slap me down . i do n't go for being jerked around .	really ? and what game did you want to play ? you carry my box for me , and i fall into bed with you ?
i think i can find my own way back to into town .	maybe i like to find out about a man first . maybe i like to know what he 's made of .
you never did answer my question .	still playing ?
that 's not an answer . what is it you want ?	you know what i want .
yeah , well i said i was an idiot . whatta you say we get out of here , take a drive somewhere , talk ...	how do you know he 's still not here ?
are there snakes out here ?	they hear you comin ' . they wo n't bother you . just do n't sneak up on 'em .
does n't the isolation bother you ?	yeah , but i like the sun . i grew up on a reservation . the sun , the desert ; they like a religion to us . jake 's the same way . he loves the desert . i guess we 're alike that way . that 's about the only way .
you love him ?	no .
did you ever ?	depends on what you call love . i grew up on a reservation . a patch of desert in the middle of nowhere . that 's where they stick indians , bobby . that 's where they leave us to die . my brother killed himself when he was 19 cause he could n't take it anymore . there 's no hope there ... jake was my ticket out . mom and me .
is that why you 're with him ?	i let him think he was courtin ' me , but i reeled him in like a fish on a line . i wanted him . i wanted what he could give me , and i would 've done anything to get him . is that love ?
i 'm guessing no .	yeah , i guess you 're right .
i take it things did n't much work out the way you planned .	i 'm still here , are n't i ? see this ?
all this nothing ? it does n't get to jake like it gets to me . he says he do n't mind being nothing but a big fish in a small pond . more like a little fish in a dried up watering hole .	you could leave him .
i do n't know how .	walk away .
it 's not that easy . maybe you can take chances ; maybe you can wander around like some stray wherever you please . i ca n't . i do n't want to be alone . i need to know i 'm going to be taken care of .	you need a meal ticket is what you mean . some guy you can latch onto just long enough for him to get you out of here .
what 's the matter ? ... grace ?	nothing .
get out of town , bobby , as quick as you can .	grace , i 've been fucked over too many times , by too many women . you 're becoming the queen of hot and cold .
you 'd never understand .	try me .
it 's just such a mess . with jake i mean ...	nothing i understand better than a mess .
you mean the shaman ?	he < u > was < /u > a shaman ... in the mine . we had nothin ' after he died . jake took us in , gave us a little money . he used to call me his `` little halfbreed '' ... he kept mom on the side y'know , cause he was married someplace else . he had kids in phoenix i think , no one knew him around here ... but the thing was ... you see ... ... he was raping me the whole time ... for years . he loved to do things to me . believe it or not , he used to say he was in love with my ass . y'ever been in love with a woman 's ass ?
yeah .	you 're sick too ... he loved to do things to me . control me . my mom ... it tore her up cause she could n't do nothing about it . she become alcoholic ... and the funny thing is -- i liked it . i liked being controlled by jake . the truth was as far out and crazy as he got , i wanted < u > more < /u > . i wanted to go all the way . women say they do n't want to be taken like , < u > really taken < /u > -- that 's bullshit -- they do . the first time he finished with me , he said i was a woman now . i was 14. then he started crying like a baby ... wanted me to hold him . it 's a strange feeling to hate someone so much for so many years , but still want to hold him , comfort him ... they found my mom right down there at the bottom of apache leap . she had cactus needles stuck all over her body and virgil ... sheriff potter said she was drunk and went insane . but i 'll never believe she ran off that cliff by accident . she was born on this earth and she loved it . she was like me . she just wanted to fly away .
after he got his divorce , he forced me to marry him ... but when i saw her body , i swore to her on my soul that some day i 'd get jake for what he did to her ...	i 'm sorry ...
yeah . what do you want . life , right ? have you ever been to california ?	yeah .
oh yeah . it 's far , it 's another world .	is it pretty ?
please . i wo n't hang on you . as soon as we get there you can dump me . i do n't care . i just want to get out of here .	honey , baby , i < u > ca n't < /u > . i ca n't even get out of here < u > myself < /u > . believe it or not , i need a lousy hundred and fifty bucks to get my car back from that crazy mechanic ...
darrell ? you know he and jake are ...	you do n't have any money put away , do you ?
jake never gives me more'n twenty bucks at a time , like a bird in a cage , he do n't want me goin ' anywhere ...	... you could get me money . i 'll get you out of here .
where ?	jake hides it . in a safe . in the floor . in the bedroom . he counts it . he loves to sit there and count it .
what do you mean ?	at night . he just sits there and laughs and talks to himself and counts it . i heard him . my mom told me he had a hunnert thousand dollars down there . maybe more .
in < u > cash < /u > ?	oh yeah . there 's nothing else with jake . he do n't trust banks . he keeps the money in the floor right under the bed . he loves it so much , he would n't think of spending any of it on me . i never seen it but i know he 's got more than a hunnert thousand at least ...
it takes a key . he keeps it on himself all the time . i mean < u > all the time < /u > . it scratches up against me when we do it .	if the key 's on him , how do we get the key ?
i ca n't kill , grace . i ca n't kill anybody .	it 's not like he 's a young man , bobby . he 's had time to live . it 'd be quick . i mean , he would n't even have to < u > feel < /u > it ... i mean , sometime in the middle of the night , when it 's quiet ... when he 's asleep , you could just come up behind him when he 's pounding on me and ...
i wanted to talk .	i do n't think we have anything to talk about .
what about us ?	there is no us , remember ?
except i ca n't get you out of my head , grace .	stop it .
why ? am i making you hot , or does the truth scare you ?	because i know you 're full of shit .
i mean it , grace . i 'm getting out of here , and i want to take you with me .	i thought you could n't get your car .
i could if i had jake 's money .	is that what changed your mind ? the money ?
are you sure ? ... about me , i mean ?	i came back for you ; this morning i came back . before i even knew about the money . you 're what i want . the only reason i stormed off is because you spooked me talking about jake . but i 've had nothing but time to think about it . it keeps coming back to you and me and us getting the hell out of here . but we 've got to get the money , baby . we get the money , i get the car , then we get the hell out .
you said you could n't kill anybody .	we do n't have to kill him . just knock him out and tie him up 'till we get away . it was your idea , remember ? i 'm doing this for you . i 'm doing this so you can fly ... fly like a bird .
grace ... grace ?	after dark . i 'll leave the back door unlocked .
the money 's right here ! get the key !	no ! you get it !
bobby ? what the hell 's the matter with you ?	i ... nothing . i just stubbed my toe on a rock . hurt like hell .
i got the money all packed . i put the jeep and his caddy in the garage . people 'll think maybe me and jake went away . buy us some time ... i know a back road we can take .	good thinking . what 's all this ?
i ca n't see it .	it should be just up ahead . hold on ... there ! there it is !
hey ! take it easy . want to get us killed ?	you do n't know what it feels like to be free of that place .
i do n't know about that ?	you spent a day in superior . i wasted my entire life there . i feel like someone just took a million pounds off my shoulders .
we 've still got some dead weight to get rid of .	ca n't we just dump him fast someplace ?
i want a place where only the vultures will find him ... it 'll be over soon , grace .	then will you take me on your friends ' boat with you ?
i 'm not sailing his boat .	but i thought --
we 're going to buy a boat of our own baby , and sail it wherever we want to go .	anywhere ?
what the hell ? why not ? where should we go ?	hawaii . i 've read all about it . i 've dreamed of going there and just lying on the beach while the water licked up against my feet . oh , god . i 'd kill to go there .
you know i thought you 'd left me back there .	what are you talking about ?
get real bobby . he was gon na kill you < u > and < /u > me .	he was in love with you grace . he would 've done what you wanted , you could 've made a deal and ...
the only deal he had in mind was killing you for jake 's murder and blackmailing me into sucking his dick for the rest of my life ... no thanks .	he was a < u > cop < /u > , grace , they never stop looking for you when you kill a cop ...
so , are n't you going to ask me ?	ask you what ? you mean what kind of horrifying sick shit is coming next ?
do n't you want to know ... ? i bet it 's burning a hole in your brain just now ?	let it go , baby . it 's the past . i got a past ...
why ?	< u > i do n't know why < /u > !
no grace , my hand 's bothering me .	you think now that jake 's dead , there 's all that money there and i do n't need you anymore , and i might just sneak up behind you sometime and ... pop !
do n't you think i would 've done it if i wanted to ? what can i do to make you relax , baby ?	you could give me my gun back .
i think nothing happens . you 're dead meat . that 's it .	you do n't believe in anything do you , bobby ?
well , nothing . we dump jake , we split the money , then you 're on your own .	do n't leave me . i want to say with you , bobby .
why ? so when the cops catch up with us you can sell me out again ?	i was just baiting him ! bobby , i had to tell him that to get his guard down . just like you told jake you was going to kill me !
when you 're finished with me , i 'm next ! i been there , baby . i been there with other cunts ... sorry , not anymore . i 'll take you as far as california . if we can make that . after that you 're on your own . try mexico . with all this bread , you can live like a queen .	i do n't want to go to mexico , bobby ! please , i really want to be with you . do n't blow this . do n't you think i care about you ?
time to go for a walk , jake .	my mother died in this canyon .
hope is a four-letter word .	but we all need that too . hold him .
thank you . thank you . i ... i knew you would n't leave me , grace .	bobby ? are you all right ?
i busted my leg !	can you make it back up ?
why 's that ?	'cause i love you .
and i love you too .	and love 's a funny thing . sometimes i do n't know if i want to love you ...
< u > jake < /u > ...	he < u > ca n't < /u > help you now , honey !
morning , officer .	son . little excitement out at the reservation this morning . wayne and dale elkhart were up drinking all night and then wayne starts chasing dale around the desert with his shotgun . bia handled it . i went by for backup .
where ya goin ' ?	harlin 's .
seen you popping up a little bit of everywhere today . you 're not planning on staying are you ?	no , sir . i 'm not going to be around long if that 's what you 're worried about .
that 's a nasty cut you got there .	yeah , fell down and hit a rock . not as bad as it looks .
there was a young fellow over at jamilla 's today when it got hit . way she tells it he got whacked around good by one of the robbers .	sounds like it . i wish i could help sheriff , but i just want to get my car and get on up the road .
that 's a shame , bobby . a real shame .	and that 's not the half of it , mr. arkadin ...
`` arkady ''	right , mr. arkady . and that 's not the half of it . i got your money , and i go into this little grocery store in this hicktown to get something to eat and then ... well , it gets < u > robbed < /u > !
... and let me guess . this robber -- he gets your money .	no . two of them . two robbers . and they < u > both < /u > get nailed ... get shot by the old lady .
the old lady ?	with a < u > shotgun < /u > ! she kills < u > both < /u > of 'em , and ... and the money in my bag gets all shredded to bloody pieces . not one bill is left alive . i mean , what are the odds ?
mr. arkady , honest , i ad to beat it outta there before the cops showed . so now i do n't have a cent to my name . i ca n't even get my car out of the garage . i tell you , mister ... if it were n't for bad luck i would n't have nay fuckin ' luck at all , you know ? so , i was wondering if you could wire me a hundred fifty-dollars so i could get my car out of this garage , see ? the bus depot here has a western union thing . and of course i 'll pay it back with the rest of the money .	which you do n't have .
yeah , if you could send it care of ...	... now , let me get this straight . two years you give me problems with your fuckin ' payoffs . now you owe me thirteen-thousand dollars , you call me - collect - then ask me to wire you one-hundred-fifty dollars just so you can get your car fixed .
a hundred-forty-five would probably cover it .	a hundred and ... now you listen to me you deadbeat little punk : i do n't care if you got hit by a truck and run over by a steamroller . you owe me thirteen-thousand dollars and < u > i want it < /u > . i do n't care how you get it , or where from , but i want it on my desk tomorrow , or i 'll show you what real bad luck is .
what 'd you say to me !	shit i 'm sorry ! ... you ca n't believe the strain i 'm under . i 'm just under a lot of strain here .
i need a ticket .	where to ?
out of here .	but , in particular ?
i ... mexico . you got a bus that goes to mexico ? that 's where i have to go .	mexico is a large country . where in mexico would you like --
how about ciudad juarez ? you could take a local , arrives in two hours , and transfer in albuquerque . it 'll get you across the border .	how much ?
one way , or round trip ?	one way .
twenty-seven , fifty . that 's all i got .	the ticket is 30.55 .
keep your change . bus three-twenty-three . leaves at seven fifty two , tonight .	i 'm sorry . it 's just ... you know ...
you got a beer ?	what kind ?
beck 's .	no beck 's . a-1 , coors ...
heineken ?	no , we ai n't got no heineken . we got miller .
genuine draft ?	no . just plain ol ' miller . now you can fuckin ' take it or you can fuckin ' leave it .
shasta ! now why 'd you go and scare the nice man like that ? sorry about that , mister . let 's see , you want $ 3.25 . you try to have a nice day now , would you ?	sure , i 'll try .
my lord , that little baby of yours virgil , has gotten cuter'n a bunny 's nose .	what was that all about ?
you know how that toby is . thinks every man he sees is after his jenny .	more like jenny is after every man she sees .
let me get your change .	flo , i 'm just gon na help myself to a refill on the coffee .
son of a bitch !	virgil ! now look at what you done ! are you all right ?
morning grace .	morning sheriff . got my drapes .
well , he offered , and i just could n't refuse . his car overheated .	oh ?
anybody hurt ?	hell , no . that wayne ca n't shoot when he 's sober , much less drunk . he 's lucky he did n't kill his own danged self . well , anyhow , you stay cool . nice meeting you , son .
you fuck this guy -- get him to do your dirty work and you think you can take the money and dump me ?	no baby , you got it wrong .
i do n't want the fuckin ' money ! i 'm not gon na give up everything i got for a lousy 50,000 dollars . it 's < u > you < /u > . you < u > grace < /u > or nothing . the whole thing ... i want you to be my wife ... . what do you way grace ?	you sound just like jake ... i did see into the future , virgil , but you were n't in it . go back to your family . they love you .
goddamnit virgil , stop ! do n't !	... but i bet the story she < u > did n't < /u > tell you was the best story of all . how old crazy jake < u > was really her papa < /u > . and she < u > liked < /u > fucking papa ! and now she 's killed the sonufabitch ! just like she 's gon na kill you !
who was that on the phone ?	wrong number .
i put up new drapes , jake .	i know . i was here when your apprentice was helping you . remember ?
you never said anything . about the drapes .	they look nice .
they look nice .	i picked them out for you , jake . i thought you would like the colors .

what 's the matter ?	you did n't hear something ?
yeah , i heard a key slapping against my ass .	there 's someone in the house .
jake , do n't go out there . call the sheriff .	shhhh ! just like your mama , always scared of things ...
help me , grace , help ...	like you helped her , jake ?
i axed you a question .	aw , toby , we were n't doing nothing . we was just talking .
honest , toby . i just axed him for a quarter for the jukebox .	stay out of this , jenny . we got man 's business to take care of . i ai n't never taken no drugs , mister , and ...
i want to stay .	i said come on !
toby ! toby tucker , leave him alone !	you stay away , jenny . i aim to mess him up , and that ai n't a thing for a woman to see .
where 's the fire sweetheart ? do n't know how they work things in nevada , but we got speed limits in this state .	vat ? i am going 5 miles an hour ! i am looking town . i not even moving .
whoa , what kind of accent you got there ? you one of them russians ?	i am russian , da ! i am also < u > rich < /u > russian , da ? maybe we work something out , my friend sheriff ?

i was in an accident once too . a horse almost trampled me to death .	wow .
proceed .	ask if he can check how many sick days i 've taken since i 've worked here ?
is that the entire message ?	yes .
wrap it up .	you 've made a considerably wise decision .
once again please ?	my son jeb . it 's a gift for him .
how old is jeb ?	four .
no , no , no , no no ... you need to go now .	what did i say ?
i 'm listening .	i 'll keep it in my office room .
what about jeb ?	i have a lock on the door .
i do n't think i got the job in new york .	what does that mean ?
i 'm still going to new york . just not this second .	i do n't want to drag this out too long for jeremy .
is jeremy okay ?	he 's asleep .
i do n't know . it 's been a while .	i have n't been sick this year . i know that .
okay .	do you remember me getting sick ?
not a specific day . what 's this about ?	megan , do you ever remember me getting sick ?
... i ca n't remember .	that 's strange is n't it ? not remembering one fever ... or a cold ... or a sore throat . what do you think that means ?
is that what you wanted to ask me ?	yes .
is there anything else you wanted to ask me while i 'm up ? ... when was the last time you wore pink ? when was the last time you drank soup standing up ? final call for strange questions at two in the morning .	no that 's it .
when was the last time i wore pink ?	the mitchell barbecue three years ago .
oh shit ...	matching shirt and shorts . it was brutal .
i 've come to a decision .	oh .
megan ?	yes . is this david ?
yeah ? megan where are you calling from ?	my name is megan inverso . we went to college together .
i remember you .	i was hoping you would call me , but ... anyway i decided not to wait . i was thinking , it might be nice to go to dinner together .
... when you work with clients on machines , do they sometimes just jump up a level or two ? do something they did n't know they were capable of ?	not often , but it is possible . most people get scared when they see the shadow of their limits . they do n't know how long the shadow really is . they do n't know how far away the real limits are standing ... they stop out of fear .
what do i do when i 'm around someone i know ?	you use your sleeve .
he 's just laying in bed . he 's pretty upset . he wo n't talk .	he 's dealing with a lot of things . i think he needs to find answers himself .
would you like to try going --	yes .
oh . elijah price came to visit me at the center today .	jesus .
he did n't do anything . he just told me his theory ... it 's sad when patients get like that . they loose reality .	jeremy what the hell are you doing ?
... i think rust .	rust ?
i did n't know that . mine 's still brown .	my turn . what 's your favorite song ?
soft and wet , by the artist formerly known as prince .	what was that ?
soft and wet . that 's very interesting .	my turn . when was the first time the thought popped into your head that we might not make it ?
i 'm not sure .	think carefully ?
what about the game ?	it 's finished . i won .
maybe it was n't a specific moment , maybe it --	i had a nightmare one night and i did n't wake you up so you could tell me it was okay . i think that was the first time . does that count ?
why ?	i do n't know megan .
you 've never been sick ?	i do n't know for sure . ... i do n't think so .
how certain are you that you have n't been sick in your life ?	seventy-five percent .
seventy-five percent ? that 's not nearly good enough for me . i 'm extremely skeptical .	skeptical about what ?
what 's he talking about ?	in college . a car accident .
i assumed because of the train .	you assumed wrong .
you forgot the `` now i 'm going to tell you what the hell is going on '' step . see usually that comes before the , `` it 's over '' step . and it always , always comes before the `` you can go '' step . what is over ?	the life of an idea that has lived too long in my head .
this city has had its share of disasters . well publicized ones . it was around the time of that plane crash , when it first entered my head . and there it stayed , as i waited and watched the news over the years ... and then one day i see a news report on a train accident and its sole survivor who was miraculously unharmed . and just like that , an idea blossoms into the flower of possible reality .	what was your idea elijah ?
at the church ... you were following me were n't you ?	technically no . i gambled that you would attend the church service . i just waited for you .
what 's this about ? this is obviously some scam . is this where you tell me one of those pictures is like an investment ?	you 've misunderstood .
it 's for last week 's game .	i 've come to understand that ... an ill advised purchase in the parking lot .
what do you want ?	not money . but i appreciate your healthy cynicism in the manner . it will be wise for both of us to proceed with greatest caution .
we 're not proceeding anywhere together .	we 've already begun .
why is it , do you think , that of all the professions in the world ... you chose protection ?	are you for real ?
just give me a minute .	is there a problem ?
i got you a seat in the seven hundred level . it 's nose-bleed territory , but at least you wo n't get spit on .	how did you know that man you bumped was carrying a weapon ?
probably the army jacket . those guys carry hunting knives and stuff for show .	you thought he was carrying a knife ?
i thought he was carrying something .	but not a knife ?
you have good instincts when it comes to things like that ?	like what ?
yes .	have you ever tried to develop it ?
i do n't know what you 're asking ?	you 're skill .
listen . i got to be on the sidelines during the game ... you can get to your seat by taking the stairwell at --	characters in comic books are often attributed special powers . x-ray vision , things of that sort .
okay , i do n't want to play this game anymore .	it 's an exaggeration of the truth . maybe it 's based on something as simple as instinct . like being able to touch someone and tell whether they 've done something wrong ... or the level of what they 've done wrong .
the guy might not have been carrying anything .	or he might have been carrying a silver handled gun tucked in his pants .
i have to go now .	one last question .
quick .	the car accident you were in ... was there anyone else involved ?
i must have felt some lump in his back when i bumped him . most guns have a black or silver handle . i had a fifty-fifty shot at the color .	that 's not what i witnessed david .
stop messing with my life elijah . my son almost shot me last night . he wanted to prove you were right .	i never said you could n't be killed . i never said that .
are you finished ?	no . and i have been sick . i spent a week in a hospital when i was a boy recovering from pneumonia and almost drowning . two skinny eight year old kids were playing around the pool . they were dunking me . i swallowed water . they did n't know it and they almost killed me . heroes do n't get killed like that . normal people do .
i am . i 'm helping him with the sale .	it 's a pleasure to meet you . i 'm david dunne .
he 's spoken of you . he says you 're becoming friends .	we are .
he 's doing well today .	i 'm very proud of him . he 's been through a lot in his life . a lot of ups and downs , a lot of bad spells . a couple i 'd thought had broken him ... i mean emotionally . they were bad ... but he made it . yes he did .
he 's kind of a miracle .	yes he is .
dunne , it 's jenkins , we got a guy at gate 17c with a bogus ticket . says he knows you . he wo n't tell me his name .	what 's he look like ?
he 's got the most beautiful eyes ... the hell kind of question is that ? he 's a guy .	send him packing . i 'm not walking all the way over there .
yeah ?	there 's a message for you at the office . your kid was hurt .
when ?	just now . they want you to come down to his school .
jeremy , why do n't you go sleep with your mom ?	i want to sleep here tonight .
i think it 's be better if i was alone .	i wo n't make any noise .
he going pro in the draft . they say he can run the fifty --	in under six seconds . i 've heard .
i 'm going to go in .	just play one set of downs . i told them you were great .
why 'd you do that ?	just one --
jeremy . i 'm going in . i have to do some things .	what things ?
i 'm going to work out .	i 'll help you .
you think you could beat up mike tyson ? i mean before he started wiggin out and eating people 's ears ?	no .
what if you worked out everyday for six months ? you think you could beat him then ?	no .
you put too much . that 's two hundred and fifty pounds .	how much can you lift ?
no .	i mean if you knew karate ?
no jeremy .	what if he was n't aloud to kick and you were really mad at him ?
how much did you take off ?	i lied .
how much is it ?	two hundred and seventy .
what do you do if something happens ?	get mom .
how many did you put on that time ?	all of it .
i 'm sleeping in my room .	i see .
i 'm not scared .	that 's great .
i know now .	know what ?
you wo n't get hurt ...	elijah was wrong .
that was me they were talking about . i almost died . that was me .	you 're lying .
i 'll just shoot him once .	jeremy listen to what --
do n't be scared .	jeremy if you pull that trigger i 'm going to leave ! i 'm going to go to new york .
you like sports ?	it 's my field . i represent athletes . i 'm an agent .
what a coincidence ? i 'm a male synchronized swimmer and i 'm looking for representation .	is that right ?
you represent someone in philadelphia ?	i 'm meeting a player from temple university . he 's a cornerback . you like football ?
not really .	this kid is six foot two , two hundred and forty pounds . he runs the fifty in under six seconds . he 's going to be a god .
yeah , hello .	is david dunne there ?
he does n't look very threatening .	that 's what i said to my son . he said , there 's always two kinds . the soldier villain who fights the hero with his hands , and then there 's the real threat . the brilliant and evil arch enemy who fights the hero with his mind .
how are you feeling ?	okay .
you are in the emergency room of the university of pennsylvania hospital . you were in a serious accident . how 's your vision ?	fine .
where were you sitting on the train ?	against a window .
in the passenger car ?	yes . where are the rest of the passengers ?
was your family traveling with you ?	no .
did you get up from your seat ?	no .
we 're going to prevent any substantial atrophy of your good leg with this . it works the quadriceps .	how long have you been married ?
twelve years .	how did you get together ?
now you 're going to have to tell me more .	... see my husband was a big football star in college and we were in an accident together . our car flipped on an icy road . we were both injured . he could n't play football anymore . if that had n't happened , we would n't have been together .
how so ?	football was n't the kind of life i wanted ... for ten years i 'd be by the phone waiting for a call telling me he broke his neck in a practice game . and if it was n't that call , it would be a call telling me he blew out his knee or suffered his third concussion . i 've seen way too much of it in my job ... i can barely take it when my clients are in pain . i do n't hate the game . i admire the amount of skill it involved and , like everyone else , i was in awe of how he could play it , but i could n't give him my heart and then have something happen to him . and it always does with that game . it 's not a thing many people would understand .
you and my mother would have a special connection .	any way , fate stepped in and took football out of the equation .
there have been three major disasters in this city over the last four years . i 've followed each one of them ... a seven-three-seven crashes on take off . one hundred and seventy-two die . no survivors ... a hotel fire downtown . two hundred and eleven die . no survivors ... and am amtrak train derails seven and half miles outside of the city . one hundred and thirty one die . one survivor . he is unharmed . i 've spoken with your husband about his survival . i suggested a rather unbelievable explanation . since then , i 've come to believe , that my explanation , however unbelievable , is in fact , true .	and what was that explanation ?
is this a religious thing ?	i own a comic book museum . it 's called the limited edition .
for a second there i thought you were a fanatic .	i believe comic books are based loosely on reality -- i believe there are real life equivalents of the heroes in those books that walk the earth -- i believe your husband is one of those individuals .
no more sitting in this room . i 've let it go on long enough .	i 'm not going out anymore . i 'm not getting hurt again . this was the last time . i told you .
... i got a present for you .	why ?
well , go get it then .	where is it ?
she 's gon na live . she did n't steal nothin ' , she did n't touch his poke .	no ?
a whippin ' ? that 's all they get ? after what they done ?	whippin ' ai n't a little thing , alice .
you ... you ai n't even gon na ... whip 'em ?	i fined 'em instead .
for what they done ? skinny gets some ponies an ' that 's ... ?	ai n't you seen enough blood for one night ? hell , alice , they ai n't loafers nor tramps nor bad men . they 're hard workin ' boys that was foolish . why if they was given over to wickedness in a regular way ...
if they was just here for the fuckin ' , how come they lit out the back window ?	on account of they seen you was beatin ' on their friend .
you just kicked the shit out of a innocent man , you big asshole .	innocent of what ?
where 'd you get the money , huh ?	we ai n't got it . we ai n't got no money .
you told them cowboys you had it .	we was ... lyin ' .
rain 's coming .	thank god .
i did n't think they 'd really do it .	what did you think , they come clear up from kansas to fuck us ?
that kid ... he 's just a ... boy . and that other one , bill , being true to his wife ...	what wife ? he do n't have no wife .
he said ...	i told you , he do n't have no wife , not aboveground , anyhow .
why , if you were to point a pistol at a king or a queen , sir , i can assure you your hand would shake as though palsied ...	i would n't point no pistol at nobody , sir .
now this strawberry alice person , tell me again .	down the street and across . greely 's beer garden and billiard parlor . just ask for alice and say you want a game of billiards .
billiards , eh ? even though i do n't really wish to play ?	do n't matter . they burned the table in '78 for firewood .
where 's little bill for christ sake ?	ha . he was building his fucking porch .
he 's coming ai n't he ?	'course he 's coming .
what 'd he say ?	little bill ? he did n't say nothing . like i said , he was buildin ' his porch . have you seen that thing ?
he did n't say nothin ' , huh ?	asked what they looked like , that 's all . christ , maybe he 's tough but he sure ai n't no carpenter .
we never seen him up against any ... like these ones ... killers .	little bill come out of kansas an ' texas , boys . he worked them tough towns .
... would n't let you settle it , huh ?	hell , you know how skinny is . says he 's gon na shoot 'em ... an i says , `` skinny , you ca n't do that , '' an ' he says , `` well , then get little bill down here an ' let 's settle this '' an ' i says , `` bill 's sleepin ' , skinny , '' an ' ...
i could n't find no bullwhips , bill . the german ...	do n't matter , we do n't need no whips . spring comes an ' skinny do n't have them ponies , i 'm gon na ...
he tell you where them others is ?	nope .
he give 'em names ?	did n't give us nothin ' but his own name ... ned roundtree .
i thought ... you was an angel .	you ai n't dead .
some big guy beat the shit out of me . i guess i must look a lot like you , huh ?	you do n't look nothin ' like me , mister .
i did n't mean no offense . i guess you 're the one them cowboys cut up . ned an ' the kid , my partners , are they ... ?	they went out scouting when they saw your fever broke .
scouting ?	on the bar t ... looking for ... them .
oh . how long i been here ?	three days . are you hungry ?
i thought i was gone . see them birds ? most times i would n't even notice them birds much . but i 'm noticin ' 'em real good 'cause i thought i was dead .	i brought your hat . you ... left it down at greely 's .
are you really going to kill them ?	yeah , i guess . there 's still a payment , ai n't there ?
them other two , they been takin ' advances on the payment .	advances ?
free ones ?	alice an ' silky gave them ... free ones .
oh . yeah .	you want ... a free one .
i did n't mean ... with me . alice and silky , they 'll give you one ... if you want .	i ... i guess not . i did n't mean i did n't want one 'cause of you bein ' cut up . i did n't mean that .
you 're a beautiful woman an ' ... if i was to want a free one , i guess i 'd want you more than them others . it ai n't ... see ... i ca n't have no free one on account of my wife ...	your wife ?
yeah . see ?	i admire that , you being true to your wife . i 've seen a lot of ... of men ... who were n't .
yeah , i guess .	she back in kansas ?
hullo , bob . boys , this here is english bob .	shit and fried eggs .
been a long time , bob . you run out of chinamen ?	little bill , i thought you were dead . i see you shaved off your chin whiskers .
what i heard was that you fell off your horse drunk and broke your neck .	i heard that one myself , bob . hell , i even thought i was dead til i found out it was just i was in nebraska . who 's your friend ?
books . he 's my biographer .	oh .
not really ... maybe a couple of peacemakers ... i imagine you could overlook those , eh , bill ? if you did n't see them ... or hear them ?	i guess not , bob . i do n't like guns around .
charley , see what kind of `` books '' mister beauchamp is packing ... but watch you do n't get wet .	be careful with those , sonny .
you leave me at the mercy of my enemies .	enemies , bob ? you been talking about the queen again ? on independence day ?
mmmm pistols .	oh yeah .
we got one of them fuckers , sheriff , out by cow creek , we ...	alive ?
hell , yeah . a bunch of us bar t boys went out lookin ' on account of them killin ' one of our own . we come across this fucker on a roan goin ' south an ' ...	he admit it ?
no ... but i guess he will soon enough . had a spencer rifle on him an ' he was ...	those cowboys messin ' him up ?
uh ... a little , maybe .	you an ' andy get the hell out there . find out where them other two went .
shut up , alice . little bill , a whippin ' ai n't gon na settle this .	no ?
this here 's a lawful contract ... betwixt me an ' delilah fitzgerald , the cut-whore . now i brung her clear from boston , paid her expenses an ' all , an ' i got a contract which represents an investment of capital .	property .
damaged property . like if i was to hamstring one of their cow ponies .	you figure nobody 'll want to fuck her .
she could maybe clean up around the place or somethin ' , but nobody 's gon na pay good money for a cut-up whore .	you boys are off of the spade outfit . got your own string of ponies ?
hit your finger , huh ?	huh ? hullo , skinny . snuck up on me . how do you like her ?
heard you done the roof yourself .	roof ? jesus , skinny , i done practically every damn thing myself . roberts boy hauled wood , that 's all .
what 's all that wood ?	porch . i 'm puttin ' a porch on her so 's i can puff my pipe of an evening an ' drink my coffee an ' watch the sun set .
yeah ?	them whores , they been fuckin ' an ' fuckin ' all them cowboys that come into town the last two weeks ...
shit , skinny , we got railroad barons an ' cattle barons , but you ' re gon na be the first of the billiard barons .	... they been fuckin ' 'em , 'an tellin ' every bow-legged one of 'em how they 're payin ' a thousand dollars to whatever sonofabitch kills them two boys which cut up delilah .
an ' all them cowboys been riding that beef down to kansas an ' cheyenne ?	yup .
all week ?	i did n't hear nothin ' till last night .
word must have got all the way to texas by now .	oh , shit , bill , i guess nobody 's gon na come clear from texas .
they really got all that money , them whores ?	you know how women kin lie ... i knock 'em around a little , ask 'em where the money is , they say they do n't have none ? ... but they coulda squirreled away that much , the five of 'em . maybe .
that much , huh ?	you could run off them two cowboys .
i could run off them whores .	well , i guess they 'll just up an ' run anyhow , them two .
uh , no . no , i ai n't drunk .	ordinance says you got to turn in your firearms to the county office day or night . i guess you did n't read it with the weather an ' all .
well ... uh ... i ... i ai n't got no , uh , firearms .	them friends of yours in the back , they carryin ' pistols ?
i ... dunno . i mean , i guess not . no , they ai n't carryin ' no guns .	you 're spillin ' your whiskey , mister .
like i said , i ...	what 's your name ?
well , mister hendershot , if i was to call you a no good sonofabitch an ' a liar , an ' if i was to say you shit in your pants on account of a cowardly soul ... well , i guess then , you would show me your pistol right quick an ' shoot me dead , ai n't that so ?	i ... i guess i might ... but like i said , i ai n't armed .
i guess you just carry it for snakes an ' such .	uh ... yeah . yeah .
there ai n't no snakes in here , mister hendershot .	well , uh ... it ai n't loaded .
he should have armed himself if he was gon na decorate his saloon with the body of my friend .	i guess you are three-fingered jack out of missouri , killer of women and children .
i do n't ... deserve this ... to die this way . i was ... building a house .	`` deserve '' do n't mean shit , little bill .
you work for the railroads too , mister beauchamp ?	n-no . i wr-wr-wr-write ... i wr- wrwrite ...
it 's only a b-b-b-book ...	a book , huh ? i guess that means you can read ... an ' i guess you boys seen them signs about surrendering your firearms ... but then , like you told old andy there , you ai n't armed , are you , bob ?
the ... duck of death .	d-d-d-duke . the d-d-duke of death .
that is you there , ai n't it , bob ? the duck of death ?	uh ... duke .
uh ... it 's ... uh ... generally considered desirable in the publishing business to ... ah ... take certain license in depicting the cover scene ... for ... ah ... purposes involving the ... ah , market place .	well , mister beauchamp ... from what i read of this here book , i 'd have to say the writin ' ai n't a whole lot different from the pitcher .
uh ... i can assure you , mister daggett ... the events described within are based ... on the accounts of eye witnesses and ...	meaning the duck himself , i guess .
duke .	duck , i says . `` you have insulted the honor of this beautiful woman , corcoran , '' said the duck . `` you must apologize . '' but two gun corcoran would have none of it and , cursing , he reached for his pistols and would have killed them but the duck was faster and hot lead blazed from his smoking sixguns . ''
i believe that to be an accurate description of the events , sir ... albeit there is a certain poetry to the language which ...	well , mister beauchamp , i was at the blue bottle saloon in wichita the night english bob killed corky corcoran ... an ' i did n't see you there ... nor no woman , nor no twogun shooters nor nothin ' like that .
first off ... corky did n't carry two pistols , though he should of .	but he was called ...
well , that bullet whizzin ' by panicked corky , an ' he done the wrong thing ! pulled his gun in such a damn hurry he shot off his own toe . meantime , bob aims good and squeezes off another ... but he 's so drunk he misses again an ' hits the thousand dollar mirror behind the bar . well , now the duck of death is good as dead 'cause this time corky does right an ' aims real good , no hurry ...	and ?
bam ! that walker colt blew up in his hand ... which was a failing common to that model . now if corky would have really had two guns instead of just a big dick he could have defended himself to the end .	you ... you mean ... english bob killed him while ... ?
but if the other fellow is quicker and fires first ...	he will be hurryin ' and he will miss . that there is as fast as i can pull an ' aim an ' hit anythin ' more'n ten feet away ... unless it 's a barn .
but ... if he does n't miss ?	then he will kill you . that is why there are so few dangerous men like old bob there ... an ' like me . it ai n't so easy to shoot a man anyhow ... an ' if the sonofabitch is shootin ' back at you ... well , it 'll unnerve most fellas . look here , let me show you somethin ' . see this here pistol ?
them 's the keys . all you got ta do is shoot me an ' you an ' english bob can ride out free as birds .	is ... is it ... loaded ?
r-r-r-really ? you r-r-really w- wwant ... ?	give it to him .
`` well , jim , '' i says , `` it makes me sick to see a man struttin ' around and packin ' two pistols an ' a henry rifle and cryin ' like a baby . ''	did you ... kill him ?
i do not like assassins an ' men of low character like your friend english bob ... but bob ai n't no coward who will cry to your face an ' then ...	uh ... sheriff ... uh ...
huh ? oh . another one , huh ? shit , i guess i 'm clean out of receptacles .	maybe you should ... hang the carpenter .
what ?	uh ... hang the ... uh ... carpenter . i ...
i was watchin ' you ... seein ' if you was followed .	silky an ' faith , they rode off to the east an ' two deputies was followin ' them .
ned 's share ?	yeah , he went south ahead of us . i guess we 'll catch him before ...
he 's ... he 's dead .	no he ai n't . he went south yesterday .
they ... they killed him . i ... thought you know that . i thought you knew because ...	nobody did n't kill ned , he went south yesterday . he did n't even kill nobody . why would anybody kill ned ?
who killed him ?	little bill . the ... the bar t boys caught him and little bill ...
he hanged him ? shot him down ?	n-no . he ... he beat him up . he was making him ... answer questions ... and beating him up ... and then ... ned just died . little bill did n't mean to kill him ... he said he was sorry an ' all ... but he said it was a good example anyhow .
good example ! good example of what i 'd like to know ? he did n't even kill nobody ... he could n't do it no more .	they got ... a sign on him says he was a killer .
a sign on him ?	in front of greely 's . it says , `` this here is what happens to ... ''
the questions little bill asked him ... what sort of questions was they ?	about where you an ' him was ... an ' where you was from ... an ' what your names was ... an ' ...
what 'd ned say ?	l-lies ... at first . about how you was just passin ' through and did n't kill nobody ... an ' little bill kept askin ' questions , mixin ' him up , catchin ' lies ... an ' then he 'd beat on ned an ' ned would cry and lie some more an ' then ... then ...
then ... what ?	a cowboy come in sayin ' you killed quick mike in the shit house at the bar t ...
an ' little bill killed ned for what i done ?	not on purpose . but he started hurtin ' him worse ... makin ' him tell stuff . first ned would n't say nothin ' ... but little bill hurt him so bad he said who you was ...
he said how you was really three fingered jack out of missouri ... an ' bill said `` same three fingered jack that dynamited the rock island and pacific in '69 killin ' women and children an ' all ? '' an ' ned says you done a lot worse than that , said you was more cold blooded than william bonney or clay alisson or the james brothers an ' how if he hurt ned again you was gon na come an ' kill him like you killed a u.s. marshall in '73 .	did n't scare little bill though , did it ?
n-no , sir ?	lemmee see that schofield , kid .
william munny , yeah .	same one as shot charlie pepper in lake county ?
you shot charlie pepper , did n't you ? and you 're the one killed william harbey an ' robbed the train over ...	hold on , mister . son , this here pig got ta be moved outta this pen , away from them others . penny , you give yer brother a hand ...
you 're pete sothow 's nephew , huh ? hell , i thought maybe you was someone come to kill me ... ... for somethin ' i done in the old days .	i could of ... easy .
yeah , i guess so .	like i was sayin ' you do n't look like no meaner than hell cold-blooded damn killer .
maybe i ai n't .	well , uncle pete said you was the goddamndest meanest sonofabitch ever lived an ' if i ever wanted a partner for a killin ' , you was the worst one . meanin ' the best . on account of you 're cold as snow an ' do n't have no weak nerve nor fear .
he said that , huh ?	i 'm a damn killer myself , only i ai n't killed so many as you because of my youth . schofield kid , they call me .
schofield ? you from schofield ?	on account of my schofield model smith and wesson pistol .
oh .	well , how about it ?

well , i guess i woulda at least pulled my pistol an ...	shit , kid , you pulled your pistol ... right outta the lady an ' out the back window .
we 're gon na need more food ... at least three days worth ...	three days ? we could kill 'em tomorrow .
i do n't kill nobody without him .	we do n't need him . the two of us could do it .
depends what he told you . about bill , you mean ?	all of it . about him , an ' you an ' uncle pete ... about robbin ' the rock island pacific ... an ' about them missouri banks .
we done that stuff .	well i guess bill munny was n't no fearless killer an ' bank robber like he said .
he 's gon na die , ai n't he ?	maybe .
well , suppose he does ?	we 'll bury him .
that ai n't what i mean .	you mean , am i gon na help you kill them cowboys ?
i ca n't spot 'em myself but you could . that red-haired one , you could spot a half-mile off , i bet .	an ' if i spot 'em ?
i 'll ride up close an ' shoot 'em !	just like that ?
i told you i 'm a damn killer . i done it before . i 'm more killer than him .	yeah ?
jack . what are you doing here ?	i 've been looking all over for you . you still after the coke that walked out of that blood bath in the harbor ?
yeah .	you can stop looking . there was no coke . i 've been in l.a. county with a guy they
there was ninety-one million -	we know , but our man says no way on the dope . this hungarian tells me the whole bunch was pulling stumps for turkey the next ' day . they had no time to negotiate that kind of product and no means to move it .
what was the money for ?	he did n't know . no one doing the deal knew except a few key people . this guy says they were real hush about it . whatever it was it was highly sensitive .
i do n't get it .	they tell me you got the cripple from new york in there . he mention keyser soze
who ?	bear with me here ...
a boy came across a body on the beach this morning . thrown clear when the boat burned . shot once in the head . two guys from the f.b.i . just identified him . +	and ?
keyser soze	there 's more .
& lt ; & lt ; we were there to buy a man and take him back to hungary. & gt ; & gt ;	he says they were buying it does n't make sense . i 'm sorry , i 'm a little rusty . they were there to buy something .
not dope . something else . some what ? .. he does n't knob what they were buying . but not dope ... people .	& lt ; & lt ; i 'll tell you everything . i'11 even say it slow enough for you to understand it . just tell this man i want protection . real protection. & gt ; & gt ;
& lt ; & lt ; no , no , no . i need a guarantee from the ridiculous man . i am going to be killed . i have seen the devil and looked him in the eye. & gt ; & gt ;	no good . he needs guarantees . he says ... his life is in danger ... he has seen the devil ... looked him in the eye .
& lt ; & lt ; keyser soze . keyser sate . i 've seen his face . i see it when i close my eyes. & gt ; & gt ;	he says he knows his face . he sees it when he closes his eyes .
& lt ; & lt ; it was smaller than that . sharper. & gt ; & gt ;	+ the nose is sharper . smaller too . + & lt ; & lt ; and what about the hair ? you said something earlier about it. & gt ; & gt ;
& lt ; & lt ; it is longer than that . and not so dark . & gt ; & gt ;	& lt ; & lt ; are you sure ? & gt ; & gt ;
& lt ; & lt ; do n't be stupid. & gt ; & gt ;	he says the hair is longer and lighter .
now remember , this is another kind of business . they do n't earn your respect . you owe it to them . do n't stare them down but do n't look away either . confidence . they are fools not to trust you . that 's the attitude .	i 'm having a stroke .
... and the desk sergeant is actually trying to tell me he ca n't release you ? can you believe that ? you were n't even charged . new york police - jesus . i want to take pictures of your face to bring to the d.a . first thing in the morning .	just forget about it .
i'11 have this thing in front of a grand jury by monday .	edie , please . i do n't want to hear this right now . what did renault and fortier say ?
they want more time to think about investing .	goddamnit .
they just said they wanted time .	time for what , edie ? time to look into me a little more , that 's what . no matter how well you cover my tracks now , they 'll find out who i am .
give me some credit . i got you this far , let 's go to the grand jury . this is never going to stop if we -	no . it 's never going to stop , period . it wo n't take more than a week before every investor in this city is walking away from us . it 's finished . i 'm finished .
do n't give up on me now , dean .	they 'll never stop .
i love you .	they ruined me tonight .
come home , dean .	alright .
that 's enough , edie .	i do n't know what you came here for , but we wo n't have any part of it .
i know who he is .	i hope i did n't disturb you .
i hope so , too , mr. kint . can i get you something to drink ?	a glass of water would be nice .
so what is it you do , mr. kint ?	umm ...
i 'd say you 've gotten on his main and central nerve , mcmanus .	do your friend a favor , fenster , keep him quiet .
forget him . it 's not important . i was trying to make a point .	this whole thing was a shakedown .
how many times have you been in a line- up ? it 's always you and four dummies . the p.d . pays homeless guys ten bucks a head half the time . no way they 'd line five felons in the same row . no way . and what the hell is a voice line-.up ? a public defender could get you off of that .	so why the hell was i hauled in and cavity searched tonight ?
it was the feds . a truck load of guns gets snagged , customs comes down on n.y.p.d . for some answers - they come up with us . they 're grabbing at straws . it 's politics - nothing you can do .	i had a guy 's fingers in my asshole tonight .
fuck you . i'11 never shit right again . so who did it ? own up .	i do n't want to know .
this is not right .	i do n't know . who was that guy that used to talk about soze in new york ?
yeah . he said he did jobs for him . indirect stuff . always five times more money than the job was worth .	come on . the guy is a pipe dream . this kobayashi is using him for window dressing .
you 're fuckin ' a right , no p.c . well screw p.c . no right . no goddamn right . you do some time , they never let you go . treat me like a criminal , i 'll end up a criminal .	you are a criminal .
i 'm sure you can understand my hesitation .	then who goes ?
do n't move , you fuckers .	right there . freeze .
everybody i ever worked with , did time with .	they fucking know everything .
it 's bullshit . this guy could be l.a.p.d . i think it 's a setup .	the way i hear it , soze is some kind of butcher . no pity .
you heard right .	the word i got is you hung up your spurs , man . what 's that all about ?
he 's alright .	how do i know that ? how about it , pretzel-man ? what 's your story ?
why do n't you just calm down '	what do you care what he says ?
keaton , we got ta go . they 're gon na find him .	dig .
it 's a logistical nightmare . close quarters , no advance layout , ten men , maybe twenty .	can we stealth these guys ?
i know you . you do n't think i know you 're on the take . this whole fucking precinct is dirty . you do n't have a fucking leg to stand on .	hockney was just a bad bastard . good with explosives . mean as a snake when it mattered .
roger really . people say i talk too much .	yeah , i was gon na tell you to shut up .
what are we gon na do ?	i can run . i got no problem with that .
me too .	did you hear what he just said ?
we 've met once or twice . last time was in ...	county . i was in for fraud .
you were waiting for a line-up then , too . what happened with that ?	i walked . ninety days , suspended .
how do you do ?	verb - roger , this is edie finneran . edie , this is roger kint , he was at
what the hell do you want ?	i wanted to talk to you . the other guys -
i did you a favor by standing up for you last night , but do n't think we 're friends . i 'm sorry , but i have other things -	they 're gon na do a job . three million dollars , maybe more .
get out .	if you 'll just let me -
do n't hurt me .	hurt you , you sonofabitch ? i could kill you .
they - that 's bullshit . they do n't operate anymore .	mcmanus has a friend in the fourteenth precinct . they 're coming out for one job - thursday . they 're picking up a guy smuggling emeralds out of south america . fenster and mcmanus have a fence set to take the stuff .
what fence ? who ?	some guy in california . his name is redfoot .
you have to come .	what 's with you ? what do you care whether i come or not ?
they - they do n't know me . you do . they wo n't take me unless you go . look at me . i need this .	tough break .
you watch your mouth .	okay , okay . you say it 's the real thing ? that 's cool .
i was out of line .	you okay ?
i'11 be alright .	well , i 'm sorry .
how are they going to do it ?	mcmanus wants to go in shooting . i said no way .
fenster and hockney ?	they 're pretty pissed off . they 'll do anything . now i got a way to do it without killing anyone : but like i said , they wo n't let me in without you .
three million ?	maybe more .
no killing ?	not if we do it my way .
we 'll make it .	do n't do this . send her a card - something .
what is it keaton ?	something - i do n't know . i ever tell you about the restaurant i wanted to open ?
what is this ?	who 's keyser soze ?
what-are they speaking ?	russian , i think . i do n't know .
keaton , i ca n't just -	i want you to find edie . both of you find some place safe . tell her what happened - everything . she knows people . she 'll know what to do . if we ca n't get kobayashi my way , she 'll get him her way .
what if i	just do what i tell you .
how are you , keaton ?	i 'd have to say my spine was broken , keyser .
ready ?	what time is it ?
let 's say for example -	this i had to see myself .
with what ?	you know damn well , dead-man .
my employer requires your services . one job . one day 's work . very dangerous . i do n't expect all of you to live , but those who do will have ninety-one million dollars to divide any way they see fit .	who 's your boss ?
my employer wishes to remain anonymous .	do n't jerk me off . we all know what this is . you do n't work with me if i work with you without knowing who i 'm working for . now let 's cut the shit . who 's the man ?
you set up the line-up .	mr. soze made a few calls , yes . you were not to be released until i came to see you . it seems mr. keaton 's attorney , ms. finneran , was a bit too effective in expediting his release . holding the rest of you became a moot point .
what about redfoot ?	mr. redfoot knew nothing . mr. soze rarely t works with the same people for very long , and they never know who they 're working for . one can not be betrayed if one has no people .
the answer is no .	mr. soze will be most -
listen to me , cocksucker . there is no keyser sate . if you say his name again , i'11 kill you right here .	a strange threat . i can only assume you 're here to kill me anyway . pity about mr. redfoot .
ahh , mr. hockney . do join us .	we know you can get to us , and now you know we can get to you . i 'm offering you the chance to call this off .
mr. so- my employer has made up his mind . he does not change it .	neither do we .
i am sorry , mr. mcmanus . f implore you to believe me , mr. keaton . mr. soze is very real and very + determined .	we 'll see .
what did you say ?	edie finneran . she is upstairs in my office for an extradition deposition . i requested she be put on the case personally . she flew out yesterday .
no matter . kill away , mr. mcmanus .	you 're lying .
we 're on vacation .	i 've got a ton of work and no good people .
take your time . enjoy l.a .	a friend of mine in new york tells me you knew spook hollis .
i hear you did time with old spook . yeah , he was a good egg . i used to run a lot of dope for him . fuckin ' shame he got shivved .	i shivved him .
better you hear it from me now than somebody else later .	business or personal ?
a little of both .	ai n't it a crime ? call if you 're interested .
get a grip . i did n't know .	you did n't know .
the job got thrown to me by this lawyer .	who is he ?
some limey . he 's a middle-man for somebody . he does n't say and i do n't ask .	we want to meet him .
he wants to meet you . he called last night and asked me to set it up . what do i tell him '	tell him we 'll meet .
what do you mean i ca n't see him ?	the d.a . came down here last night ready to arraign before they even moved him to county . kint 's lawyer comes in and five minutes later , the d.a . comes out looking like he 'd been bitch-slapped by the boogey man . they took his statement and cut him a deal .
weapons . misdemeanor two .	what'the fuck is that ?
when does he post bail ?	two hours , tops .
he wo n't go into the interrogation room .	someplace else , then .
i know what i wanted to know about keaton .	which is shit .
no matter . he 'll have to know how close we came .	keyser sate or not , if keaton 's alive he 'll never come up again .
i'11 find him .	waste of time .
a rumor is not a rumor that does n't die .	what ?
even if i was to let you talk to him , he wo n't talk to you . he 's paranoid about being recorded and he knows the interrogation rooms are wired	this wo n't be an ' interrogation , just a ... friendly chat to kill time .
no , no , no , no , no .	if it was a dope deal , where 's the dope , if it was a hit , who called it in ?
and i am sure you have a host of wild + theories to answer these questions .	you know damn well what i think .
that 's crazy , dave and it does n't matter . he has total immunity and his story checks out . he does n't know what you want to know .	i do n't think he does . not exactly , but there 's a lot more to his story . i want to know why twenty-seven men died on that pier for what looks to be ninety-one million dollars worth of dope that was n't there . above all , i want to be sure that dean keaton is dead .
his name was arturo marquez . a petty smuggler out of argentina . he was arrested in new york last year for trafficking . he escaped to california and got picked up in long beach . they were setting up his extradition when he escaped again . get this - edie finneran was called in to advise the proceedings .	kobayashi .
verbal , you know we 're trying to help you .	sure . and i appreciate that . and i want to help you , agent kujan . i like cops . i would have liked to have been a fed myself but my c.p . was -
verbal , i know you know something . i know you 're not telling us everything .	i told the d.a . everything i know .
i know you liked keaton i know you think he was a good man .	i know he was good .
sure . fifteen years ago , but he was a good thief anyway , the cops would n't let him go legit .	keaton was a piece of shit .
you trying to get a rise out of me , agent kujan ?	i just want to hear your story .
according to your statement you are a short-con operator . run of the mill seams . everything you do , you learned from somebody else .	that 's been suppressed . anything in there is inadmissible .
oh , i know . sweet deal you have . total immunity .	well i do have the weapons charge . i 'm looking at six whole months hard time .
you know a dealer named ruby deemer , verbal ?	you know a religious guy named john paul ?
you know ruby is in attica ?	he did n't have my lawyer .
there 's nothing in there about ruby .	i'11 be sure to mention that to him .
the first thing i learned on the job , know what it was ? how to spot a murderer . let 's say you arrest three guys for the same killing . put them all in jail overnight . the next morning , whoever is sleeping is your man . if you 're guilty , you know you 're caught , you get some rest - let your guard down , you follow ?	no .
i'11 get right to the point . i 'm smarter than you . i'11 find out what i want to know and i'11 get it from you whether you like it or not .	i 'm not a rat .
heartwarming . really , i feel weepy .	you wanted to know what happened after the line-up , i 'm telling you .
oh come on , verbal . who do you think you 're talking to ? you really expect me to believe he retired ? for a woman ? bullshit . he was using her .	he loved her .
that was all fenster and mcmanus .	come on . keaton was a cop for four years . who else would know the taxi service
you keep trying to lay this whole ride on t keaton . it was n't like that . sure he knew , but edie had him all turned around . r i 'm telling you straight , i swear . +	let me tell you something . i know dean keaton . i 've been investigating him for three years . the guy i know is a cold- + blooded bastard . l.a.p.d . indicted him on three counts of murder before he was kicked off the force , so do n't sell me the hooker with the heart of gold . +
you got him wrong .	do i ? keaton was under indictment a total + of seven times when he was on the force . + in every case , witnesses either reversed + their testimony to the grand jury or died + before they could testify . when they t finally did nail him for fraud , he spent + five years in sing sing . he killed three prisoners inside - one with a knife in the tailbone while he strangled him to death . of course i ca n't prove this but i ca n't prove the best part either .
i do n't know about that .	i do n't think you do . but you say you saw keaton die . i think you 're covering his ass and he 's still out there somewhere . i think he was behind that whole circus in the harbor . my bet is he 's using you because you 're stupid and you think he 's your friend . you tell me he 's dead , so be it . i want to make sure he 's dead before i go back to new york .
he was n't behind anything . it was the lawyer .	what lawyer ?
you think i do n't know you held out on the d.a. ? what did you leave out of that testimony ? i can be on the phone to ruby deemer in ten minutes .	the d.a . gave me immunity .
there was a lawyer . kobayashi .	is he the one that killed keaton ?
no . but i 'm sure keaton 's dead .	convince me . tell me every last detail . 52 scene deleted 52 53 int . hospital - day 53 + kovash 's room is now filled with people . jack baer stands next to daniel metzheiser , a balding man in his forties . next to him is doctor plumber . across from her is ridgly waiters .
so this lawyer ...	kobayashi .
came from redfoot .	right .
do you believe in him , verbal ?	keaton always said : & quot ; i do n't believe in god , but i 'm afraid of him. & quot ; well i believe in god , and the only thing that scares me is keyser soze .
i came clean . i told it like it happened on the boat . so what if i left out how i got there ? it 's got so many holes in it , the d.a . would 've told me to blow amnesty out my ass . so you got what you wanted out of me . big fucking deal .	and this is why you never told the d.a .
you tell me , agent kujan . if i told you the loch ness monster hired me to hit the harbor , what would you say ?	turn state 's evidence . take the stand on this and we 'll hear it out .
i 've got immunity now . what can you possibly offer me ?	if there is a keyser soze he 'll be looking for you .
where 's your head , agent kujan ? where do you think the pressure 's coming from ? keyser soze - or whatever you want to call him - knows where i am right now . he 's got the front burner under ' your ass to let me go so he can scoop me up ten minutes later . immunity was just to deal with you assholes . i got a whole new problem when i post bail .	so why play into his hands ? we can protect you .
that was how i ended up in a barber shop quartet in skokie , illinois .	this is totally irrelevant .
oh , but it 's not . if i had n't been nailed in illinois for running a three card monte in between sets , i never would have took off for new york . i never would have met keaton , see . that barber shop quartet was the reason for everything .	can we just get back to kobayashi ?
you 're stalling , verbal .	give a guy a break , huh ?
then what ?	mcmanus was furious . he was talking about tracking him down and ripping his heart out and all sorts of shit . that night we got the call .
what call ?	kobayashi told us where we could find fenster .
i wanted to . i thought we could make it .	why did n't you say anything ?
a man in a suit with a slim build . tall .	wait a minute .
do n't shine me , verbal . no more stalling . you know what i 'm getting at .	i do n't .
try to reef lying to me now . i know everything .	i do n't know what you 're talking about .
i do n't understand what you 're saying . i saw keaton get shot , i swear to you .	then why did n't you help him ?
i was afraid , okay ? somehow , i was sure it was keyser soze at that point . i could n't bring myself to raise my gun to him .	but keaton ...
he was a stool pigeon for the justice department . he swore out a statement to federal marshals that he had seen and could positively identify one keyser soze and had intimate knowledge of his business , including , but not exclusive to , drug trafficking and murder .	i never heard of him .
his own people were selling him to a gang of hungarians . most likely the same hungarians that sate all but wiped out back in turkey . the money was n't there for dope . the hungarians were going to buy the one guy that could finger soze for them .	i said i never heard of him .
but keaton had . edie finneran was his extradition advisor . she knew who he was and what he knew .	i do n't
there were no drugs on that boat . it was a hit . a suicide mission to whack out the one man that could finger keyser soze so sate had a few thieves put to it . men he knew he could march into certain death .	but how - wait . you 're saying soze sent t us to kill someone ?
verbal , he left you behind for a reason . if you all knew soze could find you anywhere , why was he ready to send you off with the money when he could have used you to take the boat ?	he wanted me to live .
why did he want you to live ? a one-time dirty cop without a loyalty in the world finds it in his heart to save a worthless rat-cripple ? no , sir . why '	edie .
i do n't buy that reform story for a minute . and even if i did , i certainly do n't believe he would send you to protect her . so why ?	because he was my friend .
no ...	keaton was keyser soze
no , no , no , no , no .	the kind of man that could have killed edie finneran .
edie ...	he used all of you to get him on that boat . he could n't get on alone and he had to pull the trigger himself to make sure he got his man . the one man that could identify him .
this is all bullshit .	he left you to stay behind and tell us he was dead . you saw him die , right ? or did you ? you had to hide when the first police cars showed up . you heard the shot , just before the fire but you did n't see him die .
i knew him . he would never -	he programmed you to tell us just what he wanted you to . customs has been
if he 's dead , verbal - if what you say is true , then it wo n't matter . it was his idea to hit the taxi service in new york , was n't it ? tell me the truth .	it was all keaton . we followed him from the beginning .
i did n't know . i saw him die . i believe he 's dead . christ	why lie about everything else , then ?
you 're not safe on your own .	you think he's.. ?
is he keyser soze i do n't know , verbal . it seems to me that keyser sate is a shield . like you said , a spook story , but i know keaton - and someone out there is pulling strings for you . stay here and let us protect you .	i 'm not bait . no way . i post today .
you posted twenty minutes ago . captain leo wants you out of here a.s.a.p. , unless you turn state 's .	i'11 take my chances , thank you . it 's tougher to buy the cheapest bag-man than it is to buy a cop .
where are you going to go , verbal ? you gon na run ? turn states evidence . you might never see trial . if somebody wants to get you , you know they 'll get you out there .	maybe so , but i 'm no rat , agent kujan . you tricked me , that 's all . i wo n't keep my mouth shut 'cause i 'm scared . i'11 keep it shut 'cause i let keaton down by getting caught - edie finneran too . and if they kill me , it 's
my client offers his full cooperation in these proceedings . in exchange , his testimony is to be sealed and all matters incriminating to himself are to be rendered inadmissible .	the district attorney 's office will comply provided -
no provisions , nothing . my clients testimony for his immunity .	may-i be frank , counselor ? i suspect your political power as much as i respect it . i do n't know why mr. kint has so many faceless allies in city hall , and i do n't care . the embarrassment he helped cause the city of new york will not happen here .
counselor , i will prosecute your client .	then prosecute . i will be very impressed to see if the district attorney manages to bring in twenty-seven simultaneous counts of murder against one man with cerebral palsy . i would think a man with your job would agree with these alleged & quot ; faceless people in city hall & quot ; you mention .
i'11 take my chances then . i'11 feel safer without a job if a man like mr. kint is behind bars .	mr. kint will plead guilty to weapons possession .
you 're joking .	weapons . misdemeanor one .
counselor , you 're insulting me .	counselor , you 're bluffing . shall i push for misdemeanor two ?
mr. abraham ...	abrams ...
abrams . yes . how are you today ?	i 'm fine .
good . you ever been inside a hospital ?	yes .
why did he go to see mary rooney ?	she 's the only nurse who is n't testifying for the doctors .
what did he find ?	nothing .
how good 's your intelligence ?	very good .
and so what is the rest of his case aside from dr. thompson ?	as far as we know , nothing .
he was accused of jury tampering .	accused . not indicted . he resigned the firm . divorced nineteen seventy . galvin worked with michael morrissey until morrissey retired in 'seventy-eight . since then he 's been on his own . four cases before the circuit court . he lost them all . he drinks .
four cases in three years ...	the man 's an ambulance chaser ...
... tell me about this case .	this is a nuisance suit . he 's looking for small change . he 's asking for six hundred thousand and betting we do n't want to go to court .
no -- we do n't want this case in court .	neither does he . that 's where he loses . this man 's scared to death to go to court . we only have to call his bluff .
i want to settle this thing and be done with it . i do n't want the archdiocese exposed .	no . absolutely , and we 're going to see that it is not .
so what i want to do is stop it here . i 'm going to make him an offer . i want to do it myself . i want it to come from me .	all right . but let 's keep the price down . i 've called ed concannon . he recommends that we continue to respond as if we 're going to trial .
if we were to go to trial , would we win the case ?	well , of course , it 's always dangerous ...
i know that answer . if we went to trial would we win ?	yes .
it 's a generous offer , mr. galvin ... ... nothing can make the woman well ... but we try to compensate ... to make a gesture ...	how did you settle on the amount ?
we thought it was just .	you thought it was just .
yes .	because it struck me how neatly 'three ' went into the amount . two hundred ten thousand . that would mean i keep seventy .
that was our insurance company 's recommendation .	yes . it would be .
nothing that we can do can make that woman well .	and no one will know the truth .
what is the truth ?	that that poor girl put her trust in the hands of two men who took her life , she 's in a coma , her life is gone . she has no family , she has no home , she 's tied to a machine , she has no friends -- and the people who should care for her : her doctors , and you , and me , have been bought off to look the other way . we have been paid to look the other way . i came in here to take your money . i brought snapshots to show you . so i could get your money . i ca n't take it . if i take it . if i take that money i 'm lost . i 'm just going to be a rich ambulance chaser . i ca n't do it . i ca n't take it .
what are you doing here ?	mickey told me to come back to work .
... here 's your mail , call mrs. doneghy ...	... yes . get her on the phone ...
... that was a dr. david gruber 's office ...	gruber ...
... he wants to testify ... ?	it looks that way .
you know what that would mean ? to get somebody from a boston hospital to say he 'll testify ?	... a mrs. doneghy called ... i told you that .
this is going to drive the ante up .	frank galvin 's ... who 's calling please ? bishop brophy 's office ...
that 's the call that i 'm waiting for .	what does it mean ?
they want to settle . it means a lot of money .	does that mean i 'm back for awhile ?
no , actually , she was referred to me . she was dr. hagman 's patient ...	do n't equivocate . be positive . just tell the truth .
whatever the `truth ' is , let 's hear that . you were her doctor .	yes .
say it .	i was her doctor .
you were the anesthesiologist at her delivery may twelfth , nineteen seventy ...	... i was one of a group of ...
answer affirmatively . simply . keep those answers to three words . you were n't `part of a group , ' you were her anesthesiologist . is n't that right ?	yes .
you were there to help dr. marx deliver her baby . were you not ?	yes .
anything special about the case ?	when she ...
thank you . when debby ...	dr. towler , who was in the operating room with you ?
mary rooney , the obstetrical nurse ...	what did these people do when her heart stopped ?
we went to code blue ...	`code blue , ' what does that mean ... ?
it 's a common medical expression , it 's a crash program to restore the heartbeat . dr. marx cut an airway in her trachea , to get her oxygen , her and the baby ... ms.nevins ...	why was n't she getting oxygen ... ?
well , many reasons , actually ...	tell me one ?
she 'd aspirated vomitus into her mask ...	she threw up in her mask . let 's cut the bullshit . say it : she threw up in her mask .
... and her heart stopped and she was n't getting oxygen .	that 's right .
and what did your team do ...	well , we ...
... you brought thirty years of medical experience to bear . is n't that what you did ?	yes .
... a patient riddled with complications , questionable information on her , on her admitting form ...	... we did everything we could ...
... to save her and to save the baby . is that ...	yes !
you reached down into death . now , is n't that right ?	my god , we tried to save her ... you ca n't know ... you ca n't know ...
ed concannon .	frank galvin . we 've met before .
objection , we 've ...	... to get her heartbeat back ... ?
we 've touched on this , his own witness has said ...	... almost nine minutes ... causing brain damage .
objection !	and you would come here , and on a slip of memory four years ago , you 'd ruin their lives .
dr. thompson , just so the jury knows , you never treated deborah ann kaye . is that correct ?	that is correct . i was engaged to render an opinion .
engaged to render an opinion . for a price . is that correct ? you 're being paid to be here today ?	just as you are , sir ...
are you board-certified in anesthesiology , doctor ?	no , i am not . it 's quite common in new york state ...
... i 'm sure it is , but this is massachusetts , doctor . certified in internal medicine ?	no .
neurology ?	no .
orthopedics ?	i 'm just an m.d .
do you know dr. robert towler ... ?	i know of him .
how is that ?	through , through his book .
what book is that ?	meth ... methodology and technique ...
... of anesthesiology ?	`methodology and techniques of anesthesiology . ' yes .
how old are you ?	i am seventy-four years old .
uh-huh . still practice a lot of medicine ?	i 'm on the staff of ...
yes , we 've heard that . doctor : you testify quite a bit against other physicians ? is n't that right ? you , you 're available for that ? when you 're paid to be there ?	sir . yes . when a thing is wrong ... as in this case , i am available . i am seventy-four years old , i am not board-certified . i have been practicing medicine for forty-six years and i know when an injustice has been done .
i did .	objection .
your honor , bishop brophy and the archdiocese have offered plaintiff two hundred and ten thousand dollars .	huh !
mr. concannon ... ?	nothing further , your honor .
objection ! this is ri ... expect us to accept a photocopy , we have the original right ...	i 'll rule on that presently . proceed .
no further questions .	you may step down .
thank you , your honor . we object to the copy of the admissions form as incompetemt and essentially hearsay evidence and cite mcgee versus state of indiana , u.s. 131 point 2 and 216 through 25 of the uniform code : 'the admission of a duplicate document in preference to an existing original must presuppose the possibility of alteration and so must be disallowed . ' and , your honor , having given the plaintiff the leeway we would like your ruling on this issue now : we object to the admission of the xerox form .	... one moment , mr. concannon ...
the document is disallowed , the jury will be advised not to consider the testimony of kathy costello regarding the xerox form . it 's unsubstantiated and we ca n't accept a copy in preference to the original ...	thank you , your honor . further : ms. costello is a rebuttal witness . as a `surprise witness ' she may only serve to rebut direct testimony . as her only evidentiary rebuttal was the admitting form , which has been disallowed i request that her entire testimony be disallowed and the jury advised that they must totally disregard her appearance here .
you are aware of the penalties for perjury ... ?	it 's a crime .
yes . it is a crime . a serious crime .	i would n't do it .
you would not ... ?	no .
in fact , you 've just taken an oath that you would not commit perjury . you 've just sworn to that . is n't that right ?	yes .
just now ...	yes .
... sworn before god you would tell the truth ?	yes .
now . i 'd like to ask you something : four years ago , when you were working as a nurse , are you aware that drs . towler and marx based their treatment of deborah ann kaye on this chart that you signed . . . ?	i . . ..
and was n't that an oath ... ? these are your initials here : k.c . when you signed this chart you took an oath . no less important than that which you took today . is n't that right ? is n't that right ... ?	i ... yes .
then , please , which is correct ? you 've sworn today the patient ate one hour ago . four years ago you swore she ate nine hours ago ? which is the lie . when were you lying ?	i ...
they lied .	`they lied . ' indeed ! when did they lie ? and do you know what a lie is ?
i do . yes .	you swore on this form that the patient ate nine hours ago .
that 's not my handwriting .	you 've just said you signed it .
yes , i , yes , i signed it , yes . but i , i did n't write that figure .	you did n't write that figure . and how is it that you remember that so clearly after four years ?
... what in the world would induce you to make a photocopy of some obscure record and hold it fouryears ? this is a ... why ? why would you do that ?	i thought i would need it .
and why , please tell us , would you think that ?	after , after the operation , when that poor girl , she went in a coma . dr. towler called me in . he told me he had five difficult deliveries in a row and he was tired , and he never looked at the admittance form . and he told me to change the form . he told me to change the one to a nine . or else , or else , he said ... he said he 'd fire me . he said i 'd never work again ... .who were these men ... ? who were these men ... ? i wanted to be a nurse ...
please sit down . i told your wife . i 'm sorry that we have to meet out here . i 've got a case coming in two days in the superior court and my office is a mess of papers .	... that 's all right .
... the archdiocese called up , they said who was our attorney , 'cause the case is coming to trial ...	i doubt we 'll have to go to trial ...
... we told them we did n't want it to come out this way .	i completely understand ...
what is this going to cost ?	it 's completely done on a contingency basis . that means whatever the settlement is i retain one-third ... that is , of course , the usual arrangement ...
you said you 're gon na call me up . you did n't call me up . who do you think you are ? who do you think you are ... ?	hold on a second .
it 's all right , mickey .	you ruined my life , mister ... me and my wife ... and i am going to ruin yours ... you do n't have to go out there to see that girl . we been going four years . four years ... my wife 's been crying herself to sleep what they , what , what they did to her sister .
i swear to you i would n't have turned the offer down unless i thought that i could win the case ...	what you thought ! ? what you thought ... i 'm a workingman , i 'm trying to get my wife out of town , we hired you , we 're paying you , i got to find out from the other side they offered two hundred ...
i 'm going to win this case ... mist ... mr. doneghy ... i 'm going to the jury with a solid case , a famous doctor as an expert witness , and i 'm going to win eight hundred thousand dollars .	you guys , you guys , you 're all the same . the doctors at the hospital , you ... it 's 'what i 'm going to do for you ' ; but you screw up it 's `we did the best that we could . i 'm dreadfully sorry ... ' and people like me live with your mistakes the rest of our lives .
if i could accept the offer right now , i would . they took it back .	i understand . i went to the bar association . they tell me you 're going to be disbarred .
they gave her the wrong anesthetic .	why is that ?
her sister said she ate one hour prior to admittance ... she ...	... that 's what the sister said . the chart said she ate nine hours prior to ...
... she went in complaining of stomach cramps . good doctor would have doubted the information on the chart .	is that what a good doctor would do ? how old are you , please ?
i am seventy-four years old .	what qualifies you as an expert in anesthetics ?
i am on the staff of ...	easthampton hospital for women . excuse me , what is that , a joke ? let me tell you something , doctor , those men at catherine laboure . men who are known not only in this city , but the world , were trying to save a woman 's life . they were there , and here you are , four years later , read some hospital report , and say ...
she getting good care over there ?	actually , yes . it 's by no means bad , i ...
then what good would it do to ruin the reputation of two men , to help a girl whose life 's not going to be changed in the least ? you know what code blue means ?	'code blue ' ...
are you saying that a failure to restore the heartbeat within nine minutes in itself constitutes bad medical practice ?	well ...
i ... in that small context i would have ... i would have to say 'no . '	then you 're saying there 's no negligence , based on my question ?
i ... given the limits of your question , that 's correct .	the doctors were not negligent .
dr. thompson ... ?	it was good of you to meet ...
i have some errands to run , and then i thought we 'd spend the evening ...	that 's what i 'd planned to ...
i 'm going to take you to the home to see the girl ...	from what i 've seen , mr. galvin , you have a very good case ...
yes . yes . i think so . i hope you 'll be comfortable . i 'm putting you up at my ...	... i made a reservation at ...
... apartment . no , no . please . you do n't know who we 're dealing with , i , please believe me , they ...	... what difference would ...
these people play very rough . they do n't want to lose this case . there 's a lot of pressure they can bring to bear , i ...	there 's nothing they can do to me .
dr. thompson . from your review of the hospital records of may twelfth nineteen seventy-six . in your opinion , what happened to deborah ann kaye ?	cardiac arrest . during delivery her heart stopped . when the heart stops the brain 's deprived of oxygen . you get brain damage . that is why she 's in the state she 's in today .
now , dr. towler 's testified that they restored the heartbeat within three or four minutes . in your opinion is his estimate correct ?	it 's my opinion it took him much longer . nine ... ten minutes . there 's too much brain damage .
i did n't do too well for you .	no , you did fine .
i 'm afraid that 's not true . will you want me to stay on till monday ?	no . no thank you , doctor . you go home .
you know ... sometimes people can surprise you . sometimes they have a great capacity to hear the truth .	yes ... i ... yes .
you sure you do n't want me to stay on .	no . no . thank you . you go home .
dr. towler ; page 406 , 'contraindications to general anaesthetic . ideally a patient should refrain from taking nourishment up to nine hours prior to induction of general anaesthetic . ' does that sound familiar ?	yes . i wrote it .
'practice and methodology in anaesthesia . ' general textbook on the subject . is that correct ?	i. yes . it is .
and you wrote that ...	yes .
... page 414 , 'if a patient has taken nourishment within one hour prior to inducement , general anaesthetic should be avoided at all costs because of the grave risk the patient will aspirate food particles into his mask . ' is that what happened to deborah ann kaye ? she aspirated into her mask ?	she threw up in her mask , yes . but she had n't eaten one hour prior to admission .
if she had eaten , say one hour prior to admission , the inducement of a general anaesthetic ... the type you gave her ... would have been negligent ... ?	negligent . yes ... it would have been criminal . but that was not the case .
dr. gruber ...	yes ? galvin , right ?
i appreciate -- a man as busy as --	that 's perfectly all right . i 'm kind of rushed . do you mind if we walk while we talk ?
i read the hospital report on your client .	... deborah ann kaye ...
they called , they 're going to settle , what i want to do is build up as much ...	right . who called ?
the archdiocese called , they want to settle ... her estate ...	... and you 're going to do that ?
yes .	you 're going to settle out of court ?
yes .	why ?
uh ... in the , well , in the interests of her family ... you , dr. gruber , you know , you can never tell what a jury is going to do . st. catherine 's a very well thought of institution . her doctors ...	her doctors killed her .
) i 'm sorry ... ?	her doctors murdered her . they gave her the wrong anaesthetic and they put her in the hospital for life . her doctors murdered her .
do you know who her doctors were ?	i read the file . yeah . marx and towler . i know who they were .
the most respected ...	whose side are you arguing ... ? i thought that you wanted to do something . i do n't have any interest in the woman 's 'estate ' -- no offense , but we all know where the money 's going to ... i have an interest in the hospital ; and i do n't want those bozos working in the same shop as me . they gave her the wrong anesthetic . they turned the girl into a vegetable . they killed her and they killed her kid . you caught 'em . now : how many others did they kill ?
the hospital is owned by the archdioceses of ...	what are they going to do ? not invite me to their birthday party ... ? look , i got ta go . i have to be in cambridge ...
well , well , when can we meet again . i 'd like to get a deposition..	okay . i 'll meet you here . tuesday night ... i got ta go . you going my way ?
we have to ... we ... we have to keep you under wraps . please do n't , do n't discuss ...	i understand .
thank you ...	... that 's perfectly all right .
uh , why , why are you doing this ?	to do right . is n't that why you 're doing it ?
i 'm joe galvin , i 'm representing deborah ann kaye , case against st. catherine laboure .	i told the guy i did n't want to talk to ...
i 'll just take a minute . deborah ann kaye . you know what i 'm talking about . the case is going to trial . our chief witness is a dr. david gruber , you know who he is ?	no .
he 's the assistant chief of anesthesiology , massachusetts commonwealth . he says your doctors , towler and marx , put my girl in the hospital for life . and we can prove that . what we do n't know is why . what went on in there ? in the o.r . that 's what we 'd like to know . something went wrong . and you know what it was . they gave her the wrong anesthetic . what happened ? the phone rang ... someone got distracted ... what ?	... you got your doctor 's testimony . why do you need me ?
i want someone who was in the o.r . we 're going to win the case , there 's no question of that . it 's just a matter of how big ...	i 've got nothing to say to you .
you know what happened .	nothing happened .
i can subpoena you , you know . i can get you up there on the stand .	and ask me what ?
who put my client in the hospital for life .	i did n't do it , mister .
who are you protecting , then ?	who says that i 'm protecting anyone ?
i do . who is it ? the doctors . what do you owe them ?	i do n't owe them a goddamn thing .
then why do n't you testify ?	you know , you 're pushy , fella ...
you think i 'm pushy now , wait 'til i get you on the stand ...	well , maybe you better do that , then . you know you guys are all the same . you do n't care who gets hurt . you 're a bunch of whores . you 'd do anything for a dollar . you got no loyalty ... no nothing ... you 're a bunch of whores .
yessir . i 'm sorry .	why is that ?
now , have you boys tried to resolve your little difficulty because that certainly would save the commonwealth a lot of time and bother .	this is a complicated case , your honor ...
i 'm sure it is , frank : and let me tell you something . if we find it so complex , how in the hell you think you 're going to make a jury understand it ? see my point ? let 's talk a minute . frank : what will you and your client take right now this very minute to walk out of here and let this damn thing drop ?	my client ca n't walk , your honor .
that 's it ... ? come on , guys ... life is too short ... you tell me if you 're playing 'chicken , ' or you mean it . frank : i do n't think i 'm talking out of school , but i just heard someone offer you two hundred grand ... and that 's a lot of money ... and if i may say , you have n't got the best of records .	... things change .
... that 's true . sometimes they change , sometimes they do n't . now , i remember back to when you were disbarred ...	i was n't disbarred , they dropped the pro ...
and it seems to me , a fella 's trying to come back , he 'd take this settlement , and get a record for himself . i myself would take it and run like a thief .	i 'm sure you would .
what is it ?	thank you for seeing me .
i need an extension for my case .	you should have taken their offer . especially if you were unprepared .
i had a witness disappear on me .	that happens .
i could subpoena him if i had a week .	i do n't have a week . this case never should have come to trial . you know better . you 're mr. independent . you want to be independent ? be independent now . i 've got no sympathy for you .
is the plaintiff ready ?	ready , your honor .
do we have time this morning to ... all right . mr. galvin , you want to continue now , or we can resume with dr. thompson this afternoon .	thank you , your honor , i 'll continue . dr. thompson . did you examine deborah ann kaye last night at the northern chronic care facility ?
sustained . yes . the witness will confine his testimony to review of the hospital records .	what ?
yes , mr. galvin ?	if i may be permitted to question my own witness in my own way ...
i got a letter from the judge advocate 's office on you today , fella , you 're on your way out ... they should have kicked you out on that lillibridge case . now this is it today .	i 'm an attorney on trial before the bar . representing my client . my client , do you understand ? you open your mouth and you 're losing my case for me .
listen to me , fella ...	no , no , you listen to me . all i wanted in this case is an even shake . you rushed me into court in five days ... my star witness disappears , i ca n't get a continuance , and i do n't give a damn . i 'm going up there and i 'm going to try it . let the jury decide . they told me sweeney he 's a hard-ass , he 's a defendant 's judge . i do n't care . i said , the hell with it . the hell with it . i 'll take my chances he 'll be fair .
galvin , look , many years ago ...	and do n't give me this shit , 'i was a lawyer , too . ' 'cause i know who you were . you could n't hack it as a lawyer . you were bag man for the boys and you still are . i know who you are .
are you done ?	damn right i 'm done . i 'm going to ask for a mistrial and i 'm going to request that you disqualify yourself from sitting on this case . i 'm going to take a transcript to the state and ask that they impeach your ass .
nothing further , your honor ...	mr. concannon ... ?
i object , your honor ...	overruled ...
exception !	noted . thank you . miss costello was a rebuttal witness . her sole rebuttal was the document , which has been disallowed ...
continental casualty ...	mr. alito , please .
business hours are over , sir . this is the switch ...	i have to reach him . this is an emergency . could you give me his home number ?

uh ...	fuck you . i got a call today from sally doneghy ...
... now who is that ... ?	... you 're 'sposed to be in court in ten days and she 's telling me you have n't even met with them ...
sally doneghy , now who is that ?	one lousy letter eighteen months ago . . . .i try to throw a fuckin ' case your way ...

to do what ... ? to do what , for chrissake ... ? to help her to do what ? she 's dead ...	they killed her . and they 're trying to buy it ...
mick . mick . mick ...	what ?
you -- listen : you said to me , `if not now , when ... '	i know what i said but not now . you won it . franky . you won it . when they give you the money , that means that you won . we do n't want to go to court -- is this getting to you ... ? you know who the attorney is for the archdiocese , eddie concannon .
... he 's a good man ...	... he 's a good man ... ? he 's the prince of fuckin ' darkness ... he 'll have people in there testifying that the broad is well -- they saw her tuesday on a surfboard at hyannis ... do n't fuck with this case .
... i have to stand up for her ...	frank , but not now . frank . you 're trying to wipe out some old business . but not now . i understand . but you go call 'em back . you call the bishop back .
we 've got her sister . testifies she had a meal one hour before she was admitted to the hospital . this is the point .	you got the admittance form says patient ate nine hours prior to admittance .
admittance form is wrong .	forget it . you ca n't prove it . sister 's testimony is no good . jury knows we win she gets the cash .
i 've got my dr. gruber , says her heart condition means they gave her the wrong anaesthetic anyway , plus she came in complaining of stomach pains ...	... gruber 's not bad.galvin not bad ... ? this guy 's dr. kildare , the jury 's going to love him , mick ... and you calm down , all right ? their guy , towler 's , the author of the book , 'methodology and practice , anesthesiology . ' ... and they got depositions from the nurses , everybody in the operating room , the scrub-nurse ... 'all these guys are god . i saw them walk on water ... '
they had an obstetrical nurse in there . we got a deposition from the obstetrical nurse ?	no .
'mary rooney , forty-nine . lives in arlington , still working at the hospital . ' can you get out tomorrow ? how come she is n't speaking up .	right .
okay now . cases : smith versus state of michigan .	right .
brindisi versus electric boat .	you got a good memory , franky .
jimmy ? bushmills . lookit , do me a favor . i 'll buy you a drink tomorrow .	yeah ? and what are you going to do tonight ?
been a long time , huh ... ?	i 'm getting it back . do n't worry about me , mick . i 'm fine . d'you find the obstetric nurse ?
so what ?	so what ... ? the best is yet to come . check the tv guide . they got our dr. towler on a panel on gbh on friday : 'the healing hand . the experts speak . '
what i 'm saying , they 're getting some help .	so what do you want me to do ? concannon 's going to try the case his way , i 'm going to try it mine . you want me to go wee wee wee all the time because he 's got some flack , got stories in the newspaper . i 'm going to win this case .
john : gim me a cuesta-ray .	oh shit , what 's today ?

how are you holding up ?	i 'm swell .
and all we 've got is a witch doctor !	yeah .
okay . what do you do when you do n't have a witness ?	you use their witness .
that 's right .	i think we tried that . the case is over .
are you with me ... are you awake ... ?	yeah . i 'm awake .
rooney 's protecting someone . who is she protecting ?	the doctors .
she 's protecting the doctors she 'd be up there on the stand ...	read me what she said .
`you guys are a bunch of whores ... uh ... loyalty ... you do n't care who gets hurt ... you do n't have any loyalty ... '	... one of the other nurses ?
who ? they 're all testifying . everybody who was in the o.r . 's going to take the stand .	all right . who was n't in the o.r . ?
uh ... the admitting nurse ...	what did she do ?
she did n't do anything . she took the patient 's history and signed the charts . 'k.c . ' 'kathy costello ... '	the 'history ' ... ?
we do n't have anything from the nurse association ?	the broad has disappeared ...
... yeah ... good ...	... you need some old forms that she had ... somebody 's dying ...
... four years ago ...	hello . this is mr. dorchester in records . we 're looking for kathy costello ...
what the hell are you doing here ?	we got to talk .
what are you doing in new york ... ?	come on , we 'll get a cup of coffee ...
i talked to johnnie white at the bar association . the broad used to work for one of concannon 's partners in new york awhile ago . she wanted to move to boston . how badly did she hurt us , joe ?	i do n't know .
we got a mistrial , you know . joe -- did you hear what i said ... ?	i do n't want a mistrial .
i 'm ... mrs. doneghy ? i 'm frank galvin ... why did n't you go in ?	it 's locked .
it 's not a good case . it 's a very good case . a healthy young woman goes into the hospital to deliver her third child , she 's given the wrong anaesthetic ...	... we , we love her , dick and me ...
... i 'm sure you do ...	but what can we do ? she do n't know who 's visiting her ...
... i know . i went ...	... you saw her ?
yes . yes , i have .	you know how beautiful she was ? her husband left her , and he took her kids ... . they , they , they 'd let you die in there . they do n't care . nobody cares . the patriot home , the chronic care ... in arlington ... ? they 'd take her in . perpetual care . they 'd take her . fifty thousand dollars they want . an endowment .
... fifty thousand dollars ?	i do n't want to leave her . dick ... the , the ... and father laughlin , he said that it was god 's will ...
... i understand ...	my doctor told me that i got to move out west ... that 's when we filed in court . we did n't want to sue ...
... i understand ...	... but dick , he 's looking for two years in tucson ... and they called him up and said to come out . he 's a good man . he 's only trying to do what 's right .
he saw her at the northern care ...	... and i have inquiries out to doctors , experts in the field ... there is , of course , a problem getting a doctor to testify that another doctor 's negligent ...
we just ca n't do it anymore . this is our chance to get away .	i 'm going to see you get that chance .
what does it mean ? i ... i mean we , you have other tactics ...	we , yes . yes . they , they present their side , and i get the same chance . to cross-examine ... to ... to ...
are we going to win ? we have , you know , other tactics , though ...	yes .
i spoke to her , and everything is all right .	i , what are you talking about ? i talked to her this morning , and she said ...
she told me .	she did ?
i just saw her .	in new york ?
what ?	you saw kat in new york ... ... or is she in town ? is she in town ... ?
hi .	hi . how are you doing ?
i 've been meaning to come in a long time .	you live in the neighborhood ?
uh-huh . my nephew 's going to be staying with us in a few months , so i stopped by .	how old is he ?
thank you .	you 're really ... you , are you the one they told me was the nurse ?
who told you that ?	mrs ...
mrs. simmonds .	yes .
i used to be a nurse .	that 's a wonderful profession . my daughter-in-law 's a nurse . what did you do , stop ?
kathy price ...	yes ...
you were the admitting nurse at st. catherine laboure hospital on may twelfth , nineteen seventy-six , the night deborah ann kaye was admitted ...	yes .
yes .	these are your initials , 'k.c . ' ?
d'you ask the patient when did she last eat ?	yes .
what did she say ?	she said she had a full meal one hour before coming to the hospital .
one hour .	yes .
and did you write the numeral `one ' down on the record , standing for one hour ?	i did .
a single hour .	yes .
another , frank . . . ?	... everybody . mike says , `pat , you mean to tell me for a buck you get a free lunch and a beer , and then you go in the back and get laid ? ' `that 's correct . ' mike says , `pat . have you been in this bar ? ' pat says , `no , but my sister has ... ' everyone . buy yourself one too .
i want to buy you a drink .	thanks , franky .
well , well , well . huh ?	yeah .
it 's a long road that has no turning .	that 's for sure , frank .
dr. towler ...	yes .
you have a record of what happened in the operating room ...	yes , that 's correct .
... there are notations every thirty seconds ...	yes .
... of the procedures ...	yes , the roving nurse ...
but those notations stop ... ... four-and-one-half minutes after deborah ann kaye 's ...	we , we were rather busy ...
four-and-one-half minutes after her heart stopped . and they resume seven minutes ...	as i 've said we had some more ...
... they start again three minutes earlier ...	we had rather more important things on our mind than taking notes . we were trying to restore her ...
what happened in those three ...	... we were trying to restore her heartbeat .
what happened in those three minutes ... ?	we 'd gone to 'code blue , ' we were administering electro ...
brain damage could have been ... it did n't necessarily take nine minutes , it could have been caused in two ...	wait , wait , wait , you 're saying that her brain damage could have been caused by her being deprived of oxygen for two minutes ... ?
yes .	huh . and why is that ?
franky ca n't make it . he had an appointment he forgot , he 's going to see you later . i 'm mickey morrissey , we 're supposed to get to know each other .	how 'm i doing so far ?
stearns , harrington , you know who that is ?	should i ?
a huge law firm . okay ? they put him in the firm , he 's married , everything 's superb . franky , he 's starting to talk like he comes from dorsetshire , some fuckin ' place , 'you must drop by with pat and me ... ' okay ... ?	yes .
... and he 's making a billion dollars every minute working for stearns , harrington , and he bought a dog , and everything is rosy . then mr. stearns , he tried to fix a case .	the big boy did ... ?
that frank was working on . yeah . he thought franky needed some help , so they bribed a juror . so franky finds out . he comes to me in tears . he thinks that anybody who knows what a 'spinnaker ' is got to be a saint . i told him ' franky , wake up . these people are sharks . what do you think they got so rich from ? doing good ? ' he ca n't be comforted . he tells the boys at stearns and harrington they 've disappointed him , he 's going to the judge to rat them out .	huh .
before he can get there here comes this federal marshal , and franky 's indicted for jury tampering , they throw him in jail , he 's gon na be disbarred , his life is over . jimmy , gim me another drink . how are you ?	me , too .
doctor , how long is it going to take you to pull him out of this ?	it is hard to say . six months , at least . perhaps a year . it depends to a certain extent on him .
he wo n't talk .	no . we have ways of digging out knowledge . but it takes longer . he is suffering from acute melancholia , together with a guilt complex . he blames himself for what happened to the woman . and we know little of the background .
i can give you one thing : he was in love with her .	ah ? that complicates the problem .
how 'd you get into the shipbuilding business , gavin ?	i married into it .
interesting business .	no , to be honest , i find it dull .
you do n't have to do it for a living .	no . but one assumes obligations . my wife 's family is all gone ; someone has to look after her interest . her father 's partner runs the company yard in the east -- baltimore -- so i decided as long as i had to work at it , i 'd come back here . i 've always liked it here .
how long have you been back ?	almost a year .
and you like it .	san francisco 's changed . the things a that spell san francisco to me are disappearing fast .
like all this .	i 'd like to have lived here then . the color and excitement ... the power ... the freedom .
should n't you be sitting down ?	no , i 'm all right .
i was sorry to read about that thing in the papers . and you 've quit the force . a permanent physical disability ?	no , acrophobia is n't a crippling thing . it just means i ca n't climb steep stairs or go to high places , like the bar at the top-of-the-mark . but -- -- there are plenty of street-level bars in this town .
would you like a drink now ?	no ... no , thanks . a bit early in the day for spirits . well , i guess that about covers everything , does n't it ? i never married ; i do n't see much of the `` old college gang '' ; i 'm a retired detective -- and you 're in the shipbuilding business . what 's on your mind , gavin ?
not what you think . we 're very happily married .	then ?
i 'm afraid some harm may come to her .	from whom ?
scottie , do you believe that someone out of the past , someone dead , can enter and take possession of a living being ?	no .
if i told you i believe that his happened to my wife , what would you say ?	i 'd say you 'd better take her to the nearest psychiatrist , psychologist , neurologist , psychoanalyst , or plain family doctor . and have him check you both .
i did n't mean to be that rough .	no , it sounds idiotic , i know . and you 're still the hard-headed scot , are n't you ? always were . do you think i 'm making it up ?
no .	i 'm not making it up . i would n't know how . she 'll be talking to me about something , nothing at all , and suddenly the words fade into silence and a cloud comes into her eyes and they go blank ... and she is somewhere else , away from me ... someone i do n't know . i call to her and she does n't hear . and then with a long sigh she is back , and looks at me brightly , and does n't know she 's been away ... ca n't tell me where ... or why ...
how often does this happen ?	more and more in the past few weeks . and she wanders . god knows where she wanders . i followed her one day .
watched her come out of the apartment , someone i did n't know ... walking in a different way ... holding her head in a way i did n't know ; and get into her car , and drive out to ... golden gate park . five miles . she sat on a bench at the edge of the lake and stared across the water to the old pillars that stand an the far shore , the portals of the past . sat there a long time , not moving ... and i had to leave , to got to the office . that evening , when i came home , i asked what she 'd done all day . she said she 'd driven to golden gate park and sat by the lake . that 's all .	well ?
the speedometer of her car showed she had driven 94 miles that day . where did she go ? i have to know , scottie . where she goes and what she does , before i got involved with doctors .	have you talked to the doctors at all ?
yes , but carefully . i 'd want to know more before committing her to that kind of care . scottie --	i can get you a firm of private eyes to follow her for you . they 're dependable , good boys --
i want you .	it 's not my line .
how can i see her , to know her ?	we 're going to an opening at the opera tonight . we 'll dine at ernie 's first . which is easier ?
ernie 's .	all right . you wo n't know what to look for at first , scottie . even i , who know her so well , can not tell , sometimes , when the change has begun . she looks so lovely and normal ...
you 've done well , scottie . you 're good at your job .	that 's carlotta valdes .
yes .	there are things you did n't tell me .
i did n't know where she was going to lead you .	but you knew about this .
something else . my wife , madeleine , has several pieces of jewelry that belonged to carlotta . she inherited them . never wore them , they were too old-fashioned ... until now . now , when she is alone , she gets them out and looks at them handles them gently , curiously ... puts them on and stares at herself in the mirror ... and goes into that other world ... is someone else again .	carlotta valdes was what : your wife 's grandmother ?
great-grandmother . the child who was taken from her whose loss drove carlotta mad and to her death - was madeleine 's grandmother .	well , that explains it . anyone could develop an obsession for the past , with a background like that .
but she does n't know , about her background . she never heard of carlotta valdes .	knows nothing of a grave out at mission dolores , or an old house an eddy street , or a portrait at the palace of the legion of honor ?
nothing .	and when she goes to those places ...
how do you know all these things she does n't know ?	her mother told me most of then before she died . i dug out the rest for myself , here .
why did she never tell her daughter ?	natural fear . her grandmother went insane and took her own life . and the blood is in madeleine . scottie , i ask you to watch her closely .
he had no right to say that . it was my responsibility . you did n't know her . i should n't have got you involved .	i -- i --
hello .	scottie , what happened ? she 's not home , yet .
no , she 's all right . she 's still here . but i 'll get her home soon .	what happened ?
hello ?	did she hurt herself ?
could i ask you a couple of questions ?	what for ? who are you ?
my name is john ferguson , and --	is this some kind of gallup poll , or something ?
no , there are just a few things i want to ask you , and --	do you live here in the hotel ?
no , i happened to see you come in , and i thought --	0h , i thought so ! a pick-up ! well , you 've got a nerve , following me right into the hotel and up to my room ! you beat it ! go on ! beat it !
no , please ! i just want to talk to you !	listen , i 'm going to yell in a minute !
just let me talk to you .	what about ?
you .	why ?
i 've heard that one before , too . i remind you of someone you used to be madly in love with , but she ditched you for another guy , and you 've been carrying the torch ever since , and then you saw me and something clicked . huh !	you 're not far wrong .
well , it 's not going to work . so you 'd better go .	let me come in .
i warn you , i can yell awfully loud .	you wo n't have to .
what do you want to know ?	your name . and --
judy barton .	who you are --
just a girl , i work at magnin 's --	-- and how you happen to be living here .
it 's a place to live , that 's all .	but you have n't lived here long .
about three years .	no , a year ago ! where did you live a year ago ! ! ?
i told you ! right here !	but before ! where did you live before ! ? !
listen , what is this ? what do you want ?	i want to know who you are .
will you have dinner with me ?	why ?
well , i feel i owe you something for all this ...	no , you do n't owe me anything .
then will you for me ?	dinner ... and what else ?
just dinner .	because i remind you of her ?
well ... i 've been on blind dates before ... matter of fact , to be honest , i 've been picked up before . okay .	i 'll get my car and be back in half an hour .
oh , no ! give me time to change and get fixed up !	an hour ?
mmm .	okay .
thank you again . good-night .	can i see you tomorrow ?
tomorrow night ? well --	tomorrow morning .
tomorrow m -- but i have to go to work . i 've got a job .	do n't go .
and what will i live on ? my oil wells in texas ?	i 'll take care of you .
oh , well , thank very much . but no thanks .	no , judy , you do n't understand .
oh , i understand , all right . i 've been understanding since i was seventeen . and the next step is , as long as you 're going to see me tomorrow , why do n't you stay the night .	no .
no ? then what ?	i just want to see you as much as i can !
as friends ? we 'd just see a lot of each other as friends , and you 'd `` take care of me '' ?	yes .
why ? because i remind you of someone ? that 's not very complimentary . and nothing would ... happen ...	no .
no , judy , i 'm not going to move ! please ! stay in the chair !	why ? !
will you , judy ?	i suppose i could phone the store in the morning , and say i 'm sick .
i like that one .	no , there . there 's a good one . do you like that ?
okay . now we 're going to buy you some clothes .	honest ?
there 's ransohoff 's . nothing but the best . come on .	but scottie , you do n't have to !
but i like that one , scottie .	no , it 's not right .
scottie , what are you doing ?	i 'm trying to buy you a suit .
but i loved the second one she wore . and this one -- -- is beautiful .	they 're none of them right .
you want me to dress like her ?	judy , i just want you to look nice . and i know what kind of suit would look well on you .
ah , no ! ! ! i do n't want to be dressed like someone dead !	judy --
judy , it ca n't make much difference to you . i just want to see how you 'd look and i know it wo n't be the same , but --	no , i do n't want any clothes ! i do n't want anything ! i want to get out of here !
i do n't like it !	we 'll take it ! will it fit ?
i wish you 'd leave me alone . i want to go away .	you can .
judy , i want to tell you : these few days have been the first happy days i 've had in a year .	i know . because i remind you of her . the one that 's dead . and not even that , very much .
you do n't even want to touch me .	yes . yes , i do .
the color of your hair ...	ah , no !
the trouble is , i 'm gone now . for you . and i ca n't do anything about it . i want you to love me . if i let you change me , will that do it ? if i do what you tell me , will you love me ?	yes .
well ?	it should be back from your face -- with a bun at the neck . i told them . i told you .
where shall we go for dinner ?	wherever you 'd like ...
ernie 's ?	you 've got a thing about ernie 's , have n't you ?
mmmm .	is that the best you can do ?
come here .	oh , no . you 'll muss me .
that 's what i had in mind .	too late . i 've got my face on .
i 'm suddenly hungry . would you rather go somewhere else ?	no , ernie 's is fine .
i 've got it . he bends down and bites the back of her neck .	oh ! you 're supposed to fasten it !
scottie !	how does it work ?
ca n't you see ?	oh , yeah . there .
we 're going awfully far .	i feel like driving . are you terrible hungry ?
where are you going ?	to complete my cure .

but why ? why here ?	madeleine died here .
no , i do n't want to go . i want to stay here .	i need you .
why ?	i ca n't do it alone . i need you , to be madeleine for a while . then , when it 's done , we 'll both be free .
i 'm scared .	so am i , but it has to be done . i have to tell you about madeleine , now .
... we stood there and i kissed her for the last time . and she said , `` if lose me , you 'll know that i loved you --	scottie --
and i could n't follow her . god knows i tried . one does n't often get a second chance . i want to stop being haunted . you 're my second chances , judy .	take me away ...
you look like madeleine , now . go up the stairs .	no !
we 're going up the tower , madeleine .	no ! let me go !
we 're going up the tower .	you ca n't . you 're afraid !
scottie , please ... !	but you knew , that day , that i would n't be able to follow you did n't you . who was at the top when you got there ? elster ? with his wife ?
yes !	and she was the one who died . not you . the real wife . you were the copy , you were the counterfeit . was she dead or alive when you got there ?
dead . he 'd broken her neck .	took no chances , did he ? and when you got there , he pushed her off the tower , was that it ? but you were the one who screamed . why did you scream ?
i wanted to stop it , i ran up to stop it --	why ? since you 'd tricked me so well up to then ? ! ! you played his wife so well , judy ! he made you over , did n't he ? just as i 've done . but better ! not just the hair and the clothes ! the look ! the manner ! the words ! those beautiful phony trances ! that jump into the bay ! i 'll bet you 're really a strong swimmer , are n't you ! are n't you ! !
did he train you ? rehearse you ? teach you what to say and what to do ?	yes !
and you were such an apt pupil ! what fun you two must have had , playing games with me ! why me ? why did he pick on me ? ! !	your accident ...
ah , yes ! i was a set-up . i was the made-to-order witness . where is he now ?	i do n't know ... switzerland ?
i made it .	what are you going to do ?
oh , judy ! ! when he had all her money , and the freedom and the power ... he ditched you ? what a shame ! but he knew he was safe . you could n't talk . did n't he give you anything ?	some money .
what are you going to do ?	i loved you , madeleine .
love me ... keep me safe ...	too late ... too late ... there 's no bringing her back .
why am i here ? what happened ?	you ... ... fell into the bay .
you do n't remember .	no ...
do you remember where you were ?	oh , of course i remember that ! but then i must have had a dizzy spell , and fainted !
where were you ?	at ...
... old port point ! out at the presidio ! of course i remember ! i often go there !	why ?
because i love it so . it 's beautiful there . especially at sunset . ah ... thank you for the fire .	where had you been before ?
when ?	this afternoon .
oh ... wandering about .	before ? where ? where had you been ?
please drink your coffee .	i will . you 're terribly direct in your questions .
i 'm sorry . i did n't mean to be rude .	you 're not . merely direct . what were you doing there ? at old fort point ?
wandering about .	you like it , too .
the palace of the legion of honor . the art gallery .	oh , that 's a lovely spot , is n't it ? i 've never been inside . but it looks so lovely , driving past .
lucky for me you were wandering about . thank you again . i 've been terrible bother to you .	no .
when you ... there were pins in my hair ...	oh ! yes ! here !
you should n't have brought me here , you know .	i ... did n't know where you lived .
you could have looked in my car . oh , but you did n't know my car , did you ?	yes , i knew which one it was . it 's out there , now . but i did n't think you 'd want to be brought home that way .
no , you are right , i 'm glad you did n't take me home ... i would n't have known you , to thank you ... oh , but i do n't know you ! and you do n't know me ! my name is madeleine elster .	my name is john ferguson .
that 's a good , strong name . do your friends call you john ? or jack .	john . old friends . acquaintances call me scottie .
i shall call you mr. ferguson .	no , i would n't like that . and after what happened today i should think you could call me scottie . or even john .
i prefer john . there , that 's done . and what do you do , john ?	wander about .
one should n't live alone .	some people prefer it .
will you tell me something ? has this ever happened to you before ?	what ?
no , never before . i 've fallen into lakes , out of rowboats , when i was a little girl . and i fell into a river , once , trying to leap from one stone to another . but i 've never fallen into san francisco bay . have you ? ever before ?	no ... this is the first time for me , too .
oh ! yes . hello .	good morning . i worried about you , last night . you should n't have run like that .
i ... suddenly felt such a fool .	i wanted to drive you home . are you all right ?
oh , yes . fine . no after effects . but as i remember now , that water was cold , was n't it ? what a terrible thing to do ... and you were so kind ... it 's a formal thank-you letter . and a great big apology .	you 've nothing to apologize for .
oh , yes ! the whole thing must have been so embarrassing for you !	not at all , i enjoyed --
-- talking to you ...	i enjoyed talking to you .
would you like some coffee ?	no ! no , thank you !
i could n't mail it ; i did n't know your address . but i had a landmark . i remembered coit tower and it led me straight to you .	the first time i 've been grateful for coit tower .
i hope we will , too .	what ?
meet again , sometime .	we have .
good-bye .	good-bye .
i do n't know .	shopping ?
no .	well ... anywhere in particular ?
no , i just thought i 'd wander .	ah . that 's what i was going to do .
do n't you think it 's sort of a waste for the two of us to ...	wander separately ? ah , but only one is a wanderer . two , together , are always going somewhere .
do you know where you 're going ?	of course not ! i 'm a wanderer ! i 'd like to go somewhere i 've never been !
how can you be sure ?	if i 've been there ? that 's silly ! either you 've been to a place or you have n't .
how old ?	oh ... some , two thousand years , or more .
what are you thinking ?	of all the people who have been born ... and have died ... while the trees went on living .
their true name is sequoia sempervirens : always green , ever- living .	i do n't like them .
why ?	knowing i have to die ...
do you hear anything ?	only silence . it 's always like this .
and no birds sing .	no birds live here .
would you like a drink of water ?	no , thank you .
somewhere in here i was born ... and here i died and it was only a moment for you ... you took no notice ...	madeleine !
where are you now ?	here with you .
where ?	the tall trees ...
have you been here before ?	yes ...
where were you born ?	long ago ...
no ! ... no !	tell me what it is . where do you go ? what takes you away ?
when you jumped in the bay , you did n't know where you were . you guessed but you did n't know .	i did n't jump , i fell ! you told me i fell !
why did you jump ?	no !
no , i ca n't tell you !	what ? !
take me away from here ?	home ?
i 'm responsible for you now , you know . the chinese say that once you have saved someone 's life , you are responsible for it forever . and so i 'm committed . and i have to know .	and you 'll go on saving me ? again and again ?
there is so little i know . it is as though i were walking down a long corridor that once was mirrored , and fragments of mirror still hang there , dark and shadowy , reflecting a dark image of me ... and yet not me ... someone else , in other clothes , of another time , doing things i have never done ... but still me ... and i ca n't stop to ask why , i must keep on walking . at the and of the corridor there is nothing but darkness , and i know when i walk into the darkness , i 'll die . but i 've never come to the and ; i 've always come back , before then . except once .	yesterday .
but the small scenes , the fragments in the mirror : you remember them .	vaguely ...
what do you remember ?	a room ... there is a room , and i sit there alone ... always alone ...
would you know the room ?	no ... it 's in shadow .
what else ?	a grave ...
where ?	i do n't know . an open grave . i stand by the gravestone looking down into it . and it 's my grave .
how do you know ?	i know .
there 's a name on the gravestone .	no . it 's new and clean , and waiting .
what else ?	this part is dream , i think . there is a tower and a bell and ... a garden below ... but it seems to be in spain ... a village in spain . and then it clicks off , and is gone .
a portrait ? do you ever see a portrait ?	no .
of the woman in the mirror . would you know her if you saw her ?	but i 'm the woman in the mirror !
if i could find the key ... find the beginning put it together ...	and so explain it away ? but there is a way to explain it , you see . if i 'm mad ? that would explain it , would n't it ?
i 'm not mad . i 'm not mad . and i do n't want to die , but there 's someone inside me , there 's a somebody else , and she says i must die ... scottie , do n't let me go !	i 'm here , i 've got you ...
do n't leave me ... stay with me ...	all the time .
i should have phoned ... but i wanted to see you ... be with you ...	why ? what 's happened ?
no , do n't go away !	only this far .
where 's your husband ?	i did n't wake him . i do n't want him to know ...
it was a dream , you 're awake , you 're all right , now . can you tell me ?	it was the tower again ... and the bell , and the old spanish village ...
yes --	but clear ... so very clear ... for the first time ... all of it ...
tell me .	there was a village square , a green with trees ... and an old whitewashed spanish church with a cloister . across the green : a big , grey , wooden house with a porch and shutters and a balcony above ... a small garden , and next to it , a livery stable ... with old carriages lined up inside .
go on .	at the end of the green there was a whitewashed stone house with a lovely pepper tree at the corner --
-- and an old wooden hotel of the old california days , and a saloon ... dark ... low-ceilinged ... with hanging oil lamps .	yes ? ! but --
you 've been there before . you 've seen it .	no , never !
madeleine , a hundred miles south of san francisco there 's an old spanish mission , mission san juan bautista . it 's been preserved exactly as it was a hundred years ago as a museum . now , think hard , darling . you 've been there before . you 've seen it !	no , never ! i 've never been there ! scottie , what is it ? i 've never been there !
go on with your dream . what was it that frightened you ?	i stood alone on the green , searching for something , and i started to walk to the church . but then the darkness closed in , i was alone in the dark , being pulled into darkness , and i fought to wake up ...
here with you .	and it 's a all real .
yes .	not merely as it was a hundred years ago . as it was a year ago , or six months ago , whenever you were here to see it . madeleine , think of when you were here !
my love ... because i love you .	i love you too ... too late ... too late ...
no ... we 're together ...	too late ... there 's something i must do ...
there are things i have to tell you , about how we met , and why we are together . but they can wait . the only important thing now is that i love you and i 'm going to keep you safe .	you ca n't .
why ?	let me go .
where ?	to the church , i must go there .
madeleine --	please let me go .
it 's not fair , it 's too late . it was n't supposed to happen this way , it should n't have happened ... !	it had to . we 're in love . that 's all that counts . madeleine --
let me go ! let me go ! !	madeleine ! !
you believe that i love you ?	yes .
and if you lose me , you 'll know that i loved you and wanted to go on loving you .	i wo n't lose you .
let me go into the church alone .	why ?
is there something i can do for you ?	yes ... you run this hotel .
oh , yes !	would you tell me , who has the room on the second floor in the corner , that corner ?
oh , dear ! has she done something wrong ?	please answer my question .
i ca n't imagine that sweet girl with that dear face --	what is her name ?
valdes . miss valdes . it 's spanish , you know .	carlotta valdes ?
yes , that 's it . sweet name , is n't it ? foreign . but sweet .	how long has she had the room ?
oh , it must be two weeks . yes , the rent 's due tomorrow .	does she sleep here ? ever ?
no ... she only comes to sit . two or three times a week . and i never ask questions , you know . as long as they 're well behaved . i must say that i 've wondered --	when she comes down , do n't say that i 've been here .
oh , but she has n't been here today . scottie whirls back on her .	i saw her come in five minutes . ago .
and there ! there you see ? her key is on the rack !	would you please go and look ?
her car is gone .	what car ?
ow ! !	i thought you said no more aches and pains ?
it 's this darned corset . it binds . he retrieves the stick .	no three-way stretch ? how very un- chic .
well , you know those police department doctors : no sense of style . ah , tomorrow !	what 's tomorrow ?
midge , do you suppose many men wear corsets ?	more than you think .
how do you know ? personal experience ?	please ! and what happens after tomorrow ?
what do you mean ?	what are you going to do ? now that you 've quit the police force ?
you sound so disapproving , midge .	no , it 's your life . but you were the bright young lawyer who decided he was going to be chief of police some day .
i had to quit , midge .	why ?
i wake up at night seeing him fall from the roof ... and try to reach out for him .	it was n't your fault .
i know . everybody tells me .	johnny , the doctors explained --
i know . i have acrophobia . what a disease . a fear of heights . and what a moment to find out i had it .	well , you 've got it . and there 's no losing it . and there 's no one to blame . so why quit ?
and sit behind a desk ? chairborne ?	it 's where you belong .
not with my acrophobia , midge . if i dropped a pencil on the floor and bent down to pick it up , it could be disastrous !	ah , johnny-o ...
well ? ... what 'll you do ?	nothing for a while . you forget , i 'm a man of independent means . or fairly independent .
mmm . why do n't you go away for a while ?	to forget ? do n't be so motherly , midge . i 'm not going to crack up .
have you had any dizzy spells this week ?	i 'm having one now .
from that music .	oh !
it 's a brassiere . you know about those things . you 're a big boy , now .	i 've never run across one like that .
it 's brand new . revolutionary uplift . no shoulder straps , no back straps , but does everything a brassiere should do . it works on the principle of the cantilever bridge .	uh-huh !
an aircraft engineer down the peninsula designed it . he worked it out in his spare time .	what a pleasant hobby .
how 's your love life , midge ?	that 's following a train of thought .
well ?	normal .
are n't you ever going to get married ?	you know there 's only one man in the world for me , johnny-o .
yeah , i 'm a brute . we were engaged once though , were n't we ?	three whole weeks .
ah , sweet college days . but you 're the one who blew it . i 'm still available . available ferguson . say , midge , do you remember a guy at college named gavin elster ?	gavin ? gavin elster ? you 'd think i 'd would . no .
i got a call from him today . funny . he dropped out of sight during the war , and i 'd heard he 'd gone east . i guess he 's back . it 's a mission number .	that 's skid row ... is n't it ?
could be .	he 's probably on the bum and wants to touch you for the price of a drink .
well , i 'm on the bum ; i 'll buy him a couple of drinks and tell him my troubles . but not tonight . if you wo n't drink with me , i 'll drink alone , tonight .	sorry , old man . work .
midge , what did you mean , there 's no losing it ?	what .
my ... the acrophobia .	i asked my doctor . he said only another emotional shock could do it , and probably would n't . and you 're not going to go diving off another rooftop to find out .
i think i can lick it .	how ?
here , i 'll show you what i mean . we 'll start with this .	that ! ? !
now . i look up , i look down . i look up , i look down . nothing to it .	stop kidding . wait a minute .
step number two .	okay .
easy , now .	this is a cinch . i look up , i look down . i look up --
johnny !	oh , damn it ! damn it , damn it --
now , that 's the kind of greeting a girl likes . none of this `` hello you look wonderful '' stuff . just a good straight `` who do you know '' --	well , who ? come on , you know everybody .
professor saunders , over in berkeley .	not that kind of history . the small stuff ! about people you never heard of !
oh ! you mean gay old bohemian days of gay old san francisco ! the juicy stories ? like who shot who in the embarcadero august , 1879 ?	yeah .
pop leibel .	who ?
pop leibel owns the argosy book shop . what do you want to know ?	who shot who in the embarcadero in august , 1879 .
wait a minute ! you 're not a detective any more . what 's going on ?	do you know him well ?
pop leibel ? sure .	all right , come on . introduce me . where is your hat ?
the poor thing ... .	and she died ...
now then , johnny-o ; pay me .	for what ?
for bringing you here . come on , tell !	nothing to tell .
you 'll tell , or you 'll be back in that corset ! come on !	i 'll take you home .
here you are .	you have n't told me everything .
i 've told you enough .	who 's the guy , who 's the wife ?
out . i 've got things to do .	i know . the one who phoned . your old college chum , elster .
out !	and the idea is that the beautiful mad carlotta has come back from the dead , to take possession of elster 's wife ? ah , johnny ! come on !
i 'm not telling you what i think ! i 'm telling you what he thinks !	think ? well , what do you think ?
is she pretty ?	carlotta ?
no , not carlotta . elster 's wife .	mmm , yeah , i guess ...
midge !	bye-bye !
i did . since when do you go about slipping notes under men 's doors ?	since i stopped being able to get them on the phone . for a man who has nothing to do , you 're certainly a busy little bee . where do you go , these days ?
just wander .	where ?
around .	oh ?
mm . better .	did you need it ?
yeah .	oh ?
what was this desperate urge to see me ?	all i said in the note was : `` where are you ? '' that does n't sound desperate to me .
well , i detected an undercurrent .	i just thought if i gave you a drink and fed you some dinner , you 'd be so grateful you 'd take me to a movie .
fair enough . what 'll we talk about at dinner ?	oh ... this and that .
what i 've been doing ?	if you want to . naturally , we wo n't talk about anything you do n't want to talk about .
what have you been doing ?	wandering .
oh , i 'm having a wonderful time ! i 've gone back to my first love ... painting .	good . i 've always said you were wasting your time in the underwear department .
well , it 's a living . but i 'm excited about this .	what is it , a still life ?
as a matter of fact , i thought i might give it to you .	oh ?
yes ... the beautiful carlotta ... the sad carlotta ...	what does a big old wooden house on the corner of eddy and gough street have to do with her ?
it was hers . it was built for her . many years ago .	by whom ?
she died .	how ?
by her own hand . there are many such stories .	thank you , mr. leibel . thank you very much .
no , that 's not it . nothing like it .	but you said grey , sir .
she 'll be out in a moment .	now , judy , it is n't anything to get --
yes ! that 's it !	i thought so !
oh , yes ! it may need some slight alterations , but it is madam 's size . all right , dear . we 'll have it for you to try in a moment .	how soon can it be altered ?
well ...	can we have it by tonight ?
well , if it 's absolutely necessary ...	yes , it is . now , i want to look at an evening dress , a dinner dress , black -- short -- long sleeves -- with a neck cut this ... ... and the skirt out .
the stripper 's here .	excellent .
she 's fucking hot !	i need a drink .
jesus .	do n't touch her . call 911 .
they 'll get us on accesory to murder .	bullshit it 's not accesory . i did n't do shit . you call the cops , you explain it was an accident ...
i 'm not going to ruin my life over a dead whore .	that 's a horrible ugly comment . `` dead whore ? '' she 's a person !
ca n't do what ?	we 're gon na get caught . i know we 're gon na get caught . they were eyeballing my car .
how ya doing ?	what ?
what 's that ?	what did you say ?
i said how 's it going ?	i did n't hear you .
we 're leaving from my house in three hours . if you want to come , get your numbers in order by then .	first of all ...
no first of all . i 'm not in a game mood .	you 're interrupting a personal conversation .
it 's really a stupid opinion . you have developed an annoying habit of talking for what seems to be no other reason than to hear yourself speak .	because my opinion threatens yours , it 's poorly developed ?
no , because your opinions are idiotic and have nothing to do with what any given conversation is about , which makes 85 % of your eagerly injected thought process highly offensive to me .	boyd brought up divorce statistics .
you 're an asshole adam .	you 're an asshole .
oh , and why am i an asshole ?	multiple reasons .
name one .	i do n't have to ...
tonight we return once again to the cave . tonight we let the monsters out . we fill ourselves with the spirits of genghis khan , joe namath , jfk , paton , lombardi , hemingway ...	franco mother-fucking harris !
i was just playing ... we were playing just playing around .	she 's dead .
we were playing ... she slipped ... she hit her head .	playing ?
the floor was wet . she slipped !	why was the floor wet ?
i do n't know why the floor was wet !	why ? !
why ?	it 's sacrilegious .
this is pathetic .	you 're pathetic .
what did you say ?	you 're not a team player .
do n't point at me .	you never were a team player . that 's why you never had any friends .
i have plenty of friends .	the hell you do .
the hell i do n't .	you have acquaintances - business friends and superficial golf buddies . you have always been a fringe player . you have some serious male on male intimacy problems .
fucking boyd . that fucking idiot . they 're on to us .	they 're not on to us . i 'm gon na call boyd .
about anybody but yourself . you never have .	and you 're a little fucking reject .
if you ever touch my minivan again , i 'll make you sorry . real sorry .	you 're a loser .
you got a retarded kid and a fat pig wife .	you fucking bastard !
do n't you threaten me you little rat fuck .	do n't you fucking threaten me - i 'll fucking kill you .
go home !	you go home !
four hours and fifteen minutes . i can make vegas in 3 and change .	i 'm not getting a ticket .
do n't even start .	you want to hear me out ?
one idea that if you had fucking listened to , you would each be worth approximately 15 million dollars .	you ca n't keep bringing up starbucks . that was your only real hit in like 75 tries .
more .	over eight years of some of the hardest raging experiences of my life .
she 's got no fucking pulse .	you do n't know what you 're doing .
wait !	what ?
what are you doing ?	what are you talking about ?
what do you think you are doing ?	i 'm calling the ambulance .
just wait a second . wait one second . okay . what are you doing ?	calling the ambulance .
we have to call the ambulance .	why ?
everybody shut up . listen to me !	listen to me . please . everybody just calm down a bit here . okay ... first ... are we sure she 's dead ?
are you sure this was an accident ?	you 're a lying deviant . what did you do ? !
stop it ! listen to me . let 's just take a second here and take hold of the situation , ok ? let 's just review our options here .	we have a dead woman bleeding all over the bathroom . what options ? call the police .
call the police . okay , that 's one option .	that is not an `` option . '' there is no multiple choice here .
stop it !	there 's more .
just stop .	just giving the facts .
i 'm calling the police .	what were we doing officer ? why did n't we help her ? well ... we 're all a bit high , you know , bachelor party , that kind of thing . fisher here is getting married in three days ... beautiful wife ... he did n't have anything at all to do with it ... it was all micheal here ... just micheal ...
bury her out in the desert .	sure , why not .
you do n't just casually walk out of a vegas casino with a dead woman .	we can do this . we can get her out of here .
have you completely lost your mind ? so you get her out of here . so you get her out into the desert somehow , without anybody seeing , so what , you do n't think at some point somebody might notice that she 's gone ?	nobody knows she 's here . i called her personally . nobody knows .
her blood is all over the bathroom . i 'd say that 's a bit of a dna problem .	it 's a marble floor , we can clean it up .
her fucking head was caved in .	so i did n't fucking do it !
wrap her up in blankets . bring the car around to the back of the hotel , throw her off the balcony , put her in the car ... done .	you do n't think someone will have a problem with a body being thrown off a balcony ?
we check out the area and wait for a time when it 's clear .	what about the blood ?
someone goes to walmart , gets some buckets , brushes , mops , spic and span , the works .	have you ever done this before ?
sun rises at 5:52 .	i 'm not wrecking the transmission !
wait . wait a minute .	what ?
we ca n't do this .	we 've already done this .
how do you figure ?	according to jewish law , the blood and limbs are considered to be part of the human being . they must be buried together or their souls wo n't rest in peace .
so that 's what we 're doing .	no we 're not . the bodies are all mixed up . we ca n't do this to them .
she 's asian . they do n't have jews in asia .	that is absolutely not true .
well what the fuck are we supposed to do ?	open the suitcases , unpack the body parts and reunite the limbs .
we have to get going .	i am not flexible on this .
now i am the last to say that we have done here is a good thing . it 's not . it 's not a good thing . but it was , given the circumstances , the smart play . we did what had to be done . and ... well ... i 'm proud of us . i 'm proud of each and every one of us . we performed . under the most complex and nerve shattering of situations , we stood fast and we delivered . i feel proud .	we are all going straight to hell . either hell or prison , whichever comes first .
boyd you idiot , the shit 's coming down !	what does that mean ?
you got us into this mess .	oh i did ? i think it was your little rat fuck brother who decided to play hamburger helper with the hooker 's head .
would you , shush ? ! these phones are n't secure !	lighten up adam . show some character .
do n't talk to me about character .	watch the tone fella .
fuck you boyd !	any time fat boy !
what is your problem ?	i ca n't do this .
what ?	at the seven-eleven .
who ? what are you talking about ?	they 're on me . they 're smoking me out !
you got some mighty fucking fine bad timing adam . we got a rehearsal situation here .	i do n't give a damn .
i did n't do anything ! i 'll turn your pathetic ass in !	adam ! calm down .
i wo n't calm down . i ca n't do this . we ca n't do this . it wo n't work . it will not work .	it has worked .
i 'm talking about dna samples , fiber optics , search parties , they got infrared scanners , fbi scientists . they figure this shit out . they always figure it out .	they wo n't figure it out .
all right . let 's all go back in . adam ? you 're cool right ?	no . i 'm not boyd . i am not cool at all .
do n't snap at them !	they 're driving me nuts !
honey , go in there and get some starbursts .	what ?
they 're screaming for starbursts .	later .
where 's the candy ?	there is no candy !
we 'll be ready adam .	i know you 'll be . three hours .
that 's one idea .	no ... we want padded chairs ... okay ?
real times .	they 've all been real times . and as you prepare to enter into a new phase of life , as you prepare for new roles ; father , husband , teacher , you will , as i have , come to except the letting go of of old ways . soon , the mellowing will begin ...
no . no . no . it 's what my father said to me . he said it and he meant it ... he said to me ... he said , adam , he said ... he told me and i heard him ... he said ... hell he said so many goddamn things i ca n't remember everything he said for christsake .	right ! that 's exactly what i 'm saying . my father said , first of all , i 'm your father not your friend . i 'm your father .
are you solid with that ?	no . i think it 's fucked .
the bucks gon na stop right here . if my son does n't know the six new england states , if he has trouble with geography , i wo n't stick it in his face . i 'll help the little guy . i 'll put him in the car and take him out there . i 'll take him to maine for a big lobster dinner , go skiing in vermont , hot dogs at yankee stadium ... i wo n't stare him down .	do n't ever stare him down .
i wo n't do it .	do n't eyeball your kids .
i tell mine that they 're little men . i tell them they 're strong . they make me feel joy . i let 'em know . so they really know that i need them just as much . you know . just as much man . and you know , you 're their godfather ...	i know and i 'm honored ...
if anything ever happens to me ...	i know ...
either side you idiot . i 'm calling 911 .	what happened ? oh my god ...
no way .	it has to be done .
i want you to hear me out .	what .
you and i have done nothing . you especially . we are innocent .	i do n't think so .
have you thought about what i said ?	jesus adam , can we not get into this now please ?
i got a migraine like a little monkey kicking in the side of my skull , mike tyson with a fucking sledge hammer trying to crack ...	i got you .
my god .	there 's more .
money ?	yes money . adam had a five hundred dollar term life insurance policy .
actually , no . adam was switching to a whole life policy , but re-scheduled his medical exam ... and failed to make his last payment ... so his term life lapsed . so it 's value is null and void . now he did have a pension account , worth another 150 thousand .	well , oh ...
and a house . valued at 350 thousand .	so where 's that leave us ?
so . when is the wedding .	tomorrow . we are getting married tomorrow .
what are you talking about ?	do n't sweet lip me .
i do n't understand where this personal attack is coming from ...	you 're a liar . i want to know what happened in vegas .
nothing happened in vegas .	i do n't want to hear it from the liar . stick a plug in it boyd . fisher ? what happened in vegas ?
micheal ? do you have something to tell me ?	micheal . tell lois that nothing ...
he 's upset about adam . we 're all upset .	i will call the police right now if i do n't start getting some answers .
what is it ?	ah , yeah , hi . is tina there ?
what ?	i 'm with tina . is she there ?
she 's not here .	where is she ?
okay . hi .	so who 's the lucky guy ?
who ?	the groom ?
yup .	doing the bachelor party thing ?
that 's right .	sin city . devil 's playground . the black bitch . all day every day . where 's tina ?
she 's in the bathroom ... she 's still working .	she 's still working ?
that 's right .	sweet deal .
is everything okay ?	great . fine . perfect .
she 's in there !	i 'm just gon na let her know i 'm here .
no i do n't .	fish ?
your investment ideas never work out .	that 's the whole point . they rarely work out . but on occasion they do . and when they do , they do big .
i do n't think so boyd .	fine . do n't come crying to boyd . no sir .
but not tonight .	not tonight .
keith richards , dean martin ...	jack kerouback , herman melville , henry miller and hunter s. thompson . i dedicate this evening to fear and to major loathing . so from sun set to sun rise , let me be heard ...
where do you look ? what side of the neck ?	left side .
he 's right .	we can take her out to red rock . find some quiet place ... and put her in the ground .
i got her arm .	here 's his head .
the past is the past . today is the beginning of the rest of our lives .	today is the best day of the rest of our lives .
what 's your fucking point ?	i 'm not talking to you ?
what 's goosed ?	what is her disposition ?
he just had two .	give me two more .
he 's too drunk .	he 's fine . okay mikey , let 's go . you guys stay here .
you said that boyd .	well , i did n't mean it .
tony ? this is keith fisher . you 're doing my wedding and i 'm calling about the chair situation . yeah , i 'll hold .	who 's up for making some real money ?
not really . yes , the fisher wedding chairs ...	prison communication systems . an acquaintance friend of mine is professionally involved with a communications outfit in denver that i just happen to know for a fact is about to be rewarded a very large , exclusive contract to rewire every state prison in colorado . yes sir .
no , i 'm holding for tony . in chairs . keith fisher . okay .	that would translate to government guaranteed contract in excess of 35 million dollars .
we need padded chairs .	or a stock kick of approximately 125 % on shares which are currently sitting around $ 4.38 , or , in plain english ...
she 's all your 's fish . anything you want . happy bachelor party .	i ca n't .
oh , jesus ... call the police .	no .
she 's dead . call somebody !	shut up .
call 911 .	shut up .
fuck ! fuck you fucking guys !	well we can definitely call the police . that 's an easy call . if we call the police ... what happens ? they find a dead prostitute in the bathroom ... they ask us ... what happened ? we say , ah ... our friend , micheal ... your brother ... got a little out of control ... they were making love ... and he got a little excited ... and he , ah , sort of beat her head into the side of a toilet , while he choked her to death with a rubber hose ...
oh for christsake boyd . somebody must know she 's here .	nobody knows .
oh god . this is insane .	what 's insane is the fact that micheal here put a fucking girl 's head through a toilet . that 's insane .
nobody knows she 's here .	good god ... good god ...
all right people . new plan . not even a new plan so much as a modification of the old plan .	i 'm calling the police .
that is a load of shit . personal power has nothing to do with any of this . tony robbins has helped me to unlock energy and see my options more clearly , yes , but to give him credit for this , for all of this ... well that 's just more than the man deserves .	i think we should say some words over the grave .
what kind of words ?	i 'm talking about prayer .
micheal , now is probably not the best time for this .	no , this is the perfect time . this is real time . adam . your brother and i , as well as several others present , have always suspected that you ... ... are a fully repressed , living in major denial , locked down , fly-boy butt-fucker .
it goes ; `` today is the first day of the rest of our lives . ''	however it goes , the point is , nobody says anything to anyone ever . right ? ... right ?
fisher had a less than normal relationship with that donkey .	you always were a jealous man .
the problem was our quarterback had trouble remembering his right from left ...	no , the problem , as i recall , was the lack of blocking ...
ok. definitely not cool ! definitely inappropriate behavior here .	shut up boyd .
negative . this is not what we have worked out in terms of presented behavior .	he 's having a problem here .
easy boyd .	no easy boyd ! i got a best friend in there in pieces . how about a little sensitivity ?
he 's cracked up .	he is not cracking up .
boyd ... what have we done ?	what did you ask me ?
what ?	what is the question you asked me ?
i said , what have we done ?	yes , you did . now that is the question ! that is exactly the question we should be asking ourselves . you tell me fisher . what have we done ?
i do n't know ! i just want to get married .	say it again .
what ?	what you just said . say it again .
i just want to get married .	exactly ! exactly my point .
what 's your point ?	you want to know what you are doing here ? ! you are love pumping . you are protecting all that is sacred and beautiful and in sync with poetry and sunsets and little newborn babies . you are walking the walk . this is it fisher , the real stuff . you love this woman . love is second to nothing . i love you . i love moore . i love micheal . this car is full of love , and nothing - absolutely nothing - supersedes love , man . nothing . we will do what it takes . whatever it takes .
regarding what ?	does she sound pissed , scared , hostile ? did she mention the police ?
jesus boyd you 're going to o.d . him .	suck my ass .
after you drop the kids off , take micheal home . put a few drinks in him so he 'll sleep .	i do n't think that 's such a good idea .
just do it .	what are you going to do ?
take care of business .	what does that mean ?
and what does that mean ? are you insane ? ! you think i would hurt lois ? ! she 's the mother of those kids ! what is wrong with you ?	i do n't know ...
okay . here 's the deal and it 's a good one . lois is cool . it 's a pacified situation .	what does that mean ?
i 'm talking about lois having relaxed her anxiety . only deal is ... you still got micheal there ?	yeah .
good deal . lois just wants to hear it from micheal .	hear what ?
that it was all an accident . she wants to hear it from micheal 's mouth .	now ?
that 's right .	is n't it a little late ?
this is a situation that defies judgement . we have acted and showed courage that is not of a kind known by most .	i 'm getting really tired of your bullshit .
my what ?	you 've got a warped thought process . your brain does n't function properly .
you care to add a little specification to that slanderous accusation ?	i 'm talking about some bad , bad , very bad things . bad things ! those are bad fucking things !
okay fine .	fine ? fine what ?
whatever you say kojak .	i 'm serious .
blood money . insurance dollars that you have thus fucking far decided not to tell me about at all . in no way have you mentioned that money . and i find that to be very very offensive .	you 're sick .
and if you think you can fuck me , do n't . cause i 'm fucking insulated fisher . protected . backed up on floppy . do you get me ? i want my fucking money !	not a prayer .
i 'm a lifesaver . a lighthouse . up all night in the rain , in stormy gale force wind , tornado and fucking earthquakes . i stay lit for you . i stay lit . i do n't go dark . i never go dark !	you need help .
you 're a fucking moron .	it 's my fucking opinion .
the hell i did !	the hell you did n't !
the hell i did !	you said one in two marriages end in divorce .
nope .	moore ?
your ideas never work out .	oh really ? starbucks ?
i do n't hate women .	you hate women .
false .	true .
not true .	you have a king fantasy .
i am a lover . in africa , you can stay king as long as you can service your women every night .	and what happens when you ca n't ?
if i 'm the king of israel , i say to myself , king , i say to myself , king ... take a good look around . what do i see ?	israel does n't have a king .
then what do they have ?	they have a president . a benjamin yahoo something .
i say to myself , look at the map . look what 's all around you . people who wish bad bad things for you and your people . for thousands of years the jews are fighting everybody . it used to be they 'd throw rocks , then the iron revolution and they would attack with spears . then the gunpowder revolution . now they 're shooting fire power back and forth , all day bullets flying , babies getting shot .	what 's your point ?
now if i 'm the king of israel and all these sand niggers are armed to the gills and you know it 's just a matter of time ... right ? am i right ?	the israelis can protect themselves . they got the mossad thing happening . mossad 's for real , man . they scalp babies .
there 's my point exactly .	what ? what 's your point ?
take mexico .	what ?
the mexicans would love it . they 're dying for a little order down there . they need direction .	they need leadership .
a little gut check time fellas . a time for some serious self-exploration . how do i function ? for real ? no more bullshit . can i keep my cool when they bounce my bananas ? when they wo n't play my fucking song ? etc , etc . do you get me ? do you get me ?	not really , no .
oh that 's just nothing . that 's just a missing persons thing , that 's all .	you said nobody would miss her .
this is going to stop right now . right now !	you will not screw this up .
the need to know is clear . what did adam tell lois ? that 's the name of the game . what did adam tell lois ? what does lois know ?	ball park sausages .
you want some breakfast meat . micheal . is that what you want ?	franco harris has a flare for the dramatic . the former pittsburgh steeler running back , beat known for `` the immaculate reception , '' his improbable sixty yard ricochet reception . i say ricochet reception has made a bold move on corporate america . harris has lead a group of investors in the purchase of the park sausage company . by taking on the challenge of resurrecting park 's , harris is engaged in the equivalent of a sudden death overtime .
easy micheal .	he must take an open-field run to profitability through excessive debt large competitors and dwindling market share . before the clock runs out .
we 're goosed .	we 're not goosed .
we 're goosed ! goosed by god !	micheal get a grip . what did you tell her ?
stop it !	goosed !
stop .	goosed !
okay micheal , let 's go . upsy daisy big guy .	how about my fatburger ?
come on tough guy . listen to me . you are going to tell lois that it was all an accident . okay cowboy ? you got me ?	i love you .
yea ... it 's great ... seems like ... i do n't know you 've got all the important stuff in there .	all right then . it 's refreshing to see two young people not afraid of real commitment . will you have friends or family saying words - singing or anything ?
are we supposed to ?	it 's not a question of supposed to , it 's an entirely personal decision ... some do some do n't .
may we have the rings please ?	what ?
these rings represent the commitment fisher and liz make to each other on the day . fisher do you take liz to be your beloved wife , to respect , honor and cherish till death do you part ?	i do .
this is ridiculous .	government cutbacks .
why ca n't we do it through the mail ?	we missed the deadline .
ca n't we do it on the phone ?	i do n't think so .
why is this kid staring at me ?	i 'm not sure .
did you send in all of the deposit checks ?	i think so .
what do you mean , you think so ?	i sent a lot of checks , i 'm not sure what all of them are .
the wedding cake check ?	sent it .
photographer ?	sent it .
florist ?	yup .
caterer ?	yes .
hotel for my parents , the tent , the band , the judge ...	i think i forgot the tent .
you forgot the tent ?	i think so .
why ?	why what ?
why did you forget the tent check ?	i did n't mean to liz . i 'm sorry .
you ca n't play around with these tent people .	i 'm not playing around . i forgot .
what else have you forgot ?	how could i know what else i forgot ?
i 'm working my ass off here . i 've taken care of absolutely everything keith .	because you wanted to . you wanted this to be your wedding not your parent 's .
do n't you dare .	what ?
stop it . i 'm sorry .	you know how important this is to my mother . you know that .
i 'm sorry . i 'm sorry i forgot the tent . i do n't think i forgot anything else .	i bet you did n't forget the bachelor party checks .
are we going to do this again ?	i 'm just saying i bet those checks all found the mailboxes .
i would n't know .	it amazes me how organized you and your little fun bunch can be when it comes time to mobilize to vegas .
they organized this , not me . i have nothing to do with it .	well it 's bad timing .
how do you figure ?	right before the wedding ?
it 's a bachelor party . you sort of have to do it before the wedding .	i suppose boyd is the creative force behind all this .
he is .	he 's a moron .
he 's my friend . he 's not a moron .	david boyd is a big sack of hot gas .
why do you feel the need to explore this side of your personality ?	what are you talking about ?
i 'm talking about the kind of people you hang out with ... about growing up , assuming responsibility of yourself .	i asked you to marry me . i 'm ready for marriage . that 's responsibility . that 's growth .
i just think that at some point you 're going to have to re-evaluate some of your friendships ...	who else ?
charles moore for instants .	you do n't like moore ? since when ?
it 's not that i do n't like him . but the wedding has really got me thinking and ... i just keep myself opening up . crowning . and i want you keeping up with me here .	what does moore have to do with your growing ?
i just do n't see him in the big picture .	i 've known him since cub scouts .
he 's weird .	he 's quiet .
he just does n't talk a lot .	why ? what 's his problem ?
he 's a great chef .	he 's weird . and i expect more from you .
you expect more what ?	you 're going to be hungover for three days . like those guys on `` oprah '' that get drunk and have disgusting sex with prostitutes and then say their vows with the stench of cheap hotel whore sex all over them .
time out .	it 's vile !
that 's absurd .	i 've seen it on television .
i 'm not going to marry you with the smell of prostitutes on my body .	i am not common keith . i am not common . i am a creature like no other and i will not be commoned ! is that to much to ask ? is that to much to ask ! ? !
do you love me ?	of course .
how much ?	with all my heart .
we 've got problems here .	problems ?
seating problems .	okay .
keith do not trivialize this .	i 'm not . what 's the problem ?
we 're supposed to have gold-trimmed padded seats , now they 're telling me that there was a mistake and we ca n't have padded .	what kind of seats can we have ?
not padded ones .	so what do we do ?
you go down there .	go down where ?
go down to the seat place and straighten this out .	honey i do n't have the time ...
i need your help .	we 're leaving in three hours .
i need your help .	i 'll call them from the road .
do you love me ?	more than i ever imagined being able to love anyone ever .
take care of those chairs .	we 're leaving from adam 's . come send me off .
will you please call the chair people ?	i will .
do you love me ?	of course .
just call and let me know that your okay .	i love you .
hello .	hi .
hi . are you calling from jail ?	not yet .
well , the night is young . did you straighten out the chair situation ?	i 'm working on it , i 've made three calls . i ca n't stop thinking about how much i love you .
that 's sweet .	well i do .
well you should .	what are you doing ?
just a bit of organizing .	nesting ?
yeah . nesting .	i 'm mad at you .
go have fun . not too much .	i 'll see you tomorrow ...
hello .	hey . it 's me .
where are you ?	we 're on our way home . i just ... we 're running a little late .
how late ?	no . just like an hour or so .
what about the chairs ?	okay .
what okay ?	what !
the chairs .	i left a message . i think it 's going to be okay .
you sound funny . did you do cocaine ?	no . no . i 'll see you in about four hours .
what 's the word on the chairs ?	i 'm working on it .
`` darli ... ing you , ewe ewe ewe , send me , darli ... ing you , ewe ewe ewe , mend me .	`` at first i thought it was infatuation ... but oh it 's lasted so long ... ''
this is our honeymoon .	after the wedding , which we 're paying for ourselves , and this house ...
yeah baby . everything 's great .	well , can you come back inside ?
yeah . sure .	now ?
everything 's ok. just some more preparations .	are they fighting ?
cancel ? ! cancel ? ! are you out of your fucking mind ? !	nobody 's saying cancel . i 'm talking about modifying .
no way .	can we just talk this out ?
lois is a mess and micheal 's really upset . everyone 's upset .	we 're not canceling .
i know .	i wo n't even discuss it .
no one 's discussing it . i 'm just gon na run micheal home . i 'll be right back .	i need you to pick up the cake tomorrow .
do n't we already have someone to do that for us ?	yeah . you .
that means we get five hundred thousand to help raise the kids .	no .
it 's okay ... it 's okay baby . cry for mama . cry for mama .	no it 's not okay . it 's not .
cry for boom boom . it 's okay .	liz we 've got to cancel , we have to put it off .
do n't even .	do you love me ?
what ?	do you love me ?
what kind of stupid question is that ?	oh god . we . liz . we . we . killed a woman . we ...
what are you talking about ?	oh liz . we . god . we , in vegas . micheal crushed her skull . she was dead . there was nothing else to do . it was an accident .
who 's dead ?	the prostitute .
you fucked a prostitute ?	no micheal did . it was an accident .
you killed a prostitute .	micheal , by accident .
call the police .	it 's too late .
my god . you 've got to call the police , tell them it was an accident . where is she ?	she 's in the desert . she 's out in the desert .
you left a dead prostitute out in the desert ? alone ?	she 's not alone ... she 's ... boyd ... oh god ... he 's gone nuts ... he killed lois and micheal ... it 's all ...
stop ! you stop right here . i do n't want to know anymore . i told you not to do this bachelor party thing . you were warned .	but ...
no buts . i told you your friends were jackasses .	but ...
i told boyd two fucking minutes !	what money ?
he kept saying he was protected .	what does that mean ?
like if something happened to him , he could still get us .	like how ?
i do n't know . he could have told someone . he could have , like in the event of his death , somehow let someone know where those bodies are buried .	the only proof is those bodies .
so what do we do ?	move the bodies .
i ... liz ... all i ever wanted , was for you to be happy . i just wanted to give you the wedding , the life you always dreamed of ... ... i just love you so much ... so much ...	you and moore move the bodies and bury boyd with them . in fact , put moore in the ground too .
what ?	if you do n't tie up all the loose ends it 'll never be over .
no ...	you put him down or do n't bother coming back .
but ...	do you love me ? do you love me ? !
i wanted to just take this final opportunity to visit with you . you know , just to be with you , father and son , before you run off and do your own husband , daddy thing . i 'm just so goddamn proud of you ... god knows i did n't always play it right with you ...	you did all right dad .
i could have done it better . i 'm a fucking ball-buster i am .	you never walked away dad . you could have walked away .
i 'm just so scared of that song . that fucking , `` my son just arrived the other day ... he says thanks for the ball , come on let 's play . i got lots of bills come again next day . he 's grown up just like me ... my boy is just like me . '' gordon fucking lightfoot , cat stevens , whoever , that song just fucking kills me .	harry chaplin . `` cats in the cradle . ''
just kills me ...	i love you dad .
everything okay ?	yeah , dad . it 's great .
well , i 'm in the middle of my goddamn toast here .	ok , ok. you guys just go back in . dad , keep going with the toast , we 'll be right in . go on .
that 's just insecurity .	i do n't know . she 's really been stressing out .
just insecurity . nut crunching gut splinters .	what does that mean ?
it means she 's insecure .	about what ?
mike brenn . yes . yes . 14.3 at 7.5 for 6. at 29.83 at 9. i 'm amazed the windows do n't blow out of their fucking sockets with all the repressed , ass-puckering rage in these soul-less lizards .	i just want her to be happy .
i 'm not breathing right .	you 're not breathing right ?
i do n't care for him .	he 's your brother .
i 'll take a ride .	go for it .
i 'm getting married ...	i 'm sorry ... i 'm sorry ... i 'm sorry ...
dear god ... i do n't know how to pray .	just go ahead and say what 's on your mind .
where did you get that ?	at the newsstand on 3rd .
do you hear buzzing fish ?	buzzing ?
yeah . i got some kind of buzzing . like a zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz thing just chipping away in the back of my skull .	i do n't hear it .
yeah , well , it 's a nasty problem .	have another drink .
dad used to bring home these sparklers to me and adam . out back we 'd light 'em up . the three of us . we 'd hold 'em up to the sky and watch the explosions of light . sparks . and dad would be all ... `` get ready '' ... '' watch for it '' ... '' here it comes , '' here comes the `` wahoo '' .	the wahoo ?
the sparkler would burn hot , then hotter , then even hotter ... and there would be one moment of pure burn when that little fucker would cook just perfect . perfect . it would only last a second , but that second was it . it was it . that 's what dad had us looking for ... you get me ?	the wahoo moment ?
that 's my point ! you see man ... burning at his absolute . to see all the forces just come together , just right , you know , just in perfect harmony . that 's what i 'm driving at . you get me ?	i think so .
i appreciate it . i do , but ... maybe you ought to just ease up om yourself a bit .	no . no . no . this is my doing . you see i 'm gon na have my wahoo spark for my own . for lois and the kids , for my brother , for franco . i 'm gon na turn myself in . i am all that . i 'm gon na do it for sweet lois .
if i was to think ... if i were to think ... no i mean i have thinked it over ... i have . and without putting a lot of pressure on you i just ... well i just ...	what is it ?
that ought to be about the end of that .	yup .
no ... no .	how do you know she 's dead .
boyd ... i do n't know man ... it just seems to me that ever since you took tony robbins self-help thing ... you 're all fucked-up in the head .	i got to agree with that .
the first day .	what ?
i told her that i have no idea what adam was talking about in that letter .	did she believe you ?
i have no idea .	you can tell when people believe you . it 's obvious .
i 'm thinking about maybe making a move .	a move ?
greenpeace .	greenpeace ?
where 's boyd ?	downstairs in the closet .
he came to me early today , was talking about money , insurance money . said he was gon na get what was his .	my god ...
he said he was the brain trust . said he was smarter than all of us . he started reading `` atlas shrugged , '' staring at himself in the mirror .	did he try to kiss you ?
you alright ?	yeah . i 'm thinking about micheal 's franco harris fixation . you know how micheal was always harping `` immaculate reception ? '' i 've seen that play . a lot of times ... and i have to say this ... franco was lucky . flat out , right place , right time . that 's it . he was where the ball bounced . you get me ?
i guess .	i 'm saying it 's luck . all luck . you work your entire life , all the training , focus , all the dedication , all irrelevant . where does the ball bounce ? my father spent his whole life trying to start a company , practiced every day , worked like a dog , finally got enough money . he 's paid the dues , he 's ready , does all the market research , picks his shot - `` pup corn . ''
pup corn ?	that 's right , `` pup corn . '' doggie treats . little snacks for dogs . he 's figured it out . there is a hole in the market and he 's going to fill it . spends all our money , works himself into not two but three heart attacks getting this shit up . after fifteen months , the big day arrives , the first box of `` pup corn '' pops off the belt . he comes running home with that box , pulls us out of school . we all pile into the living room , must be fifty of us , and in comes `` shelmer , '' our 8 year old mutt . `` here shelmer , '' my dad cries . he 's got that little fucking pup corn in his hand , `` here girl . '' this dog will eat anything , she eats rocks , anything . she walk 's up to my dad 's hand , looks down at the little pellet , licks it once , turns around , walks out of the room . shelmer rejected the `` pup corn . '' fifteen months of my dad 's life , right there . not one dog ate pup corn . not one . three months later , `` pup corn '' shuts down . chapter eleven . my father never got over it . never .
there .	where ?
yeah ?	i think there 's a lot of truth in that . i 'm gon na pursue some options . i want to join that big brother thing .
that 's a good one .	i want a black one . a little black brother . that 's a big problem it seems to me . lack of racial integration . that 's a big one . you think ?
i think you 'd make an excellent big brother .	that 's what i 'm thinking .
well that ought to be about the end of that .	yup .
we do n't say `` love , honor and obey '' anymore . and we do n't say `` till death do us part . '' today we say , `` respect , honor and cherish , as long as you both do love . '' how does that sound ?	i kind of like `` till death do us part . '' i mean , this is forever . in sickness and in health , through good times and bad . honey , what do you think ?
we do n't think so . i mean , we just want the singing when i come out .	okay great . what will that be ?
we 're just going to have the leader of the band sing alone with his guitar . acoustic .	what song ?
`` you send me . ''	oh i know that . how does it go ...
liz do you take fisher to be your beloved husband , to respect , honor and cherish him till death do you part ?	i do .
... we will compare these before photos with whatever form of degeneration presented to us in 24 hours , no matter how low , how vile ...	... embarrassing , shameful ...
... regression of modern man to his most primitive , ape-like state ...	the stone age .
the post-vegas man .	a mutant species .
i love it . i just love , love , love , love it .	are you guys gon na fill this place with kids ? you sure got room for them .
we 're in no hurry . i think we 'll take some time to enjoy each other , enjoy our freedom before we surrender ourselves to kids .	take your time . i wish i had .
we will .	so where to on the honeymoon ?
smart . smart . smart . think big picture , take your time . i wish i had .	that 's our plan .
good times .	drum banging real times .
she 's dead .	it was an accident !
fucking desert .	fish , i 'm really sorry . i just ... i owe you man . desert .
right .	that 's right .
shut up micheal .	i killed my brother !
you see for me it 's over . over baby . i 'm gon na turn myself in . after the wedding of course . after the wedding . out of respect .	i do n't think that 's a good idea .
i 'll come to you tonight .	no , the children sleep with me .
give them to refugio .	no , i do n't want to because they yell . and i 've got news for you too .
keep quiet . these miserable brats only get in the way .	you 'd like me to kill them ?
did n't you say you know how to make vanilla pudding ?	yes , yes .
stop this , stop this .	let me go , don amalio , i 'll tear her apart .
where 's the camera ?	it 's a present from my parents .
so much the better . we 'll all fit . how many floors are there ?	two .
are there many windows ?	lots . it 's got balconies and two big towers .
when i was n't so miserable i used to sell pigs . begging your pardon , i was more honest than my holy mother .	so you did n't come from the poorhouse !
no , miss . smoking makes him spit and feel ill .	smoking makes me feel ill ? it 's these filthy fag ends . i wo n't mention in this company what 's upsetting you .
they 've got a real hen house here ! you ca n't hear yourself speak .	tell me the answer to this ! what bird lays eggs in a barn ?
don amalio !	what 's that ?
enedina and paco ...	what about them ?
which couch ?	that one .
take me there .	really , don amalio , there 's not much point in making a fuss .
yes , uncle . how are you ?	i 'm well ... the bus was late , was n't it ? ... what was the journey like ?
excellent . what a charming , peaceful place , uncle .	you 'll think you 're still at the convent .
how long are you staying ?	a very short while , uncle . i 've been given permission to stay only a few days .
was that difficult to get ?	no . mother superior told me to come .
did you have so little interest in seeing me ?	to tell you the truth , not very much . i can not lie . i respect you and i am grateful to you because i owe you everything materially , but otherwise ...
you have no feelings toward ...	no .
you 've been neglecting the farm , uncle .	in twenty years the grass has invaded everything . there are spiders all over the house except on the first floor . i hardly ever go out .
come down here , you scamp .	who is she ?
my maid ramona 's daughter . she 's a little animal .	come down .
how like your aunt you are , even in your walk .	i know , uncle , you 've told me that already .
i 'm going to make you a nun 's cake . it will make your mouth water .	you are spoiling me too much . i wo n't know what to do with myself when you 've gone .
what do you mean ?	nothing . i did n't say anything .
how did you know about that ?	oh , some years ago i heard my mother talking about it . but is it true ?
yes , it is .	do n't you ever see him ?
never .	how could anybody behave like that ?
sometimes these things happen because of inexperience . sometimes it 's because of ...	evil .
his mother wanted to keep him . she came from a poor family . i was in love with your aunt . i would like to have acknowledged him but i was afraid of losing her . that 's why i did n't say anything .	and this innocent child .
you must think i am a monster .	no , but what a pity life is like that .
no , uncle ; ashes mean penance and death .	then it 's penance for you who are going to be a nun ; and for me , who am old , it 's death ...
if you like , i will come with you tomorrow to the village when you leave .	thank you , uncle .
this evening we must do something special by way of a farewell .	whatever you like .
i should like you to do something for me . it 's an innocent sort of thing but i 'm very set on it .	today i can refuse you nothing .
how strange you are ! when i asked you to do this favor for me you refused . you seemed almost offended . and now , here you are , making me so very happy all of a sudden . thank you , my child !	i do n't like masquerading , but as you see i decided to give in to your whim .
you must think i 'm mad .	no , uncle , and now i 'm pleased to have been able to do this favor , because , although i did n't think so at first , you are really a good man .
if you only knew ... when i was young i was full of idealism . i wanted to do something on a big scale for others , something to show my great love for humanity . but as soon as i tried to do something about it , i became afraid that i would be laughed at and i felt like a fool ... and so i went back into my shell .	was n't that cowardice ?
uncle , you must n't think that i wo n't be sad to leave you .	it 's up to you entirely . do n't leave , then ...
unfortunately ...	it 's my fault . if i 'd come to see you more often , if i 'd invited you here for holidays , maybe everything would be different .
yes , i do n't want you ever to leave this house .	you must be out of your mind . i 've been so happy these last few days -- now you 've spoiled it all .
leave us alone , ramona .	do n't go !
you 're lying .	no , it 's true . last night when you were sleeping , i had you all to myself .
think about it . do n't hurry . think it over .	go away ! leave me alone .
let me pass !	you must listen to me before you go .
all that i said just now was a lie . i said it so you would n't leave . i only molested you in my thoughts ... i ca n't bear to have you leave me , hating me like this . tell me you believe what i 'm saying and i 'll let you go .	you disgust me ... even if what you say is true .
leave me now . you can go to bed .	yes , sir . good night .
why do n't you ask her to stay on for a few days ?	i have asked her but she 's ungrateful . sometimes i feel like hitting her . when i talk to her about the convent , she turns to stone .
sit down , i 'm going to need your help .	what 's the matter ?
sit down , woman , sit down . you like me , do n't you ?	i 'd be really ungrateful , if i did n't like you , sir ; you took me and my little girl in when i did n't know where to turn .
yes , yes , but there 's no need to bring that up . how far are you prepared to help me ?	just say the word , sir , and i 'll do anything .
why do n't you speak to her , ramona ? women are good at that sort of thing . think of something that will make her stay a few more days . you are kind , ramona ! speak to her . i know i do n't need to offer you anything , but , if you 're successful in this , i 'll not forget you or your little girl .	but sir , what can i say to her ? and why should she pay any attention to what a servant tells her ?
the way she looked at me , ramona ! she hates me now . i think i 've made a great mistake . she 's going away , she 's going away and nothing will stop her .	speak to her again . explain everything to her seriously .
what for ? she 'll only look at me that way again ... i could n't . you go . perhaps she 'll listen to you . try to convince her .	but what can i say to her , sir ?
you believe me , do n't you ?	yes , sir .
do n't lie . you do n't believe me either .	it 's only that ... it 's all very odd , sir .
what will the lady say ?	she wo n't even know .
is it all right ?	yes .
they told us you 'd be back tomorrow ...	i did n't want to do it , don jorge . they made me ...
how much is that ?	fifteen yards .
that 's fifteen by seven ?	that 's it .
have you thought of what you want planted yet ?	the fields have been left so long ; with a good manuring anything will grow .
it 's for wheat . we 've always grown maize in the strip above the vegetables .	and in the vegetable plot ?
hold on , ramon ! is there time to make another trip ?	no , sir , it 's nearly six o'clock . okay , let 's get a move on ! when are you leaving ?
me ?	come on , miss . just so the virgin can be really pretty .
it wo n't take but a minute . it 's a votive offering for a lady who was cured just when she was dying of fever . our lady of the helpless granted her a favor .	do you have great devotion for the virgin ?
it 's very good .	thank you ; but it 's missing something .
my god , what have you done to him !	he was asking for it .
ramona ! ramona !	quiet , my dove . quiet , or i 'll ...
not in that way ; you 're always looking for company .	why do you say that ? perhaps the young girl is a bit jealous .
what 's the matter with you ?	nothing .
why the bad temper ?	it 's viridiana . she 's getting on my nerves .
she 's mad .	no , not mad at all : she 's rotten with religion .
so , ramona !	run and get something to mop it up with , quickly .
if you wake first , wake me up .	what are you going to do ?
what i do every day , but i want to do it earlier .	you 're happy , are n't you !
should n't i be ? you , on the other hand ...	i 'm bored . i 'm alone all day and i do n't know what to do .
what are you thinking about ?	that your cousin is more to your taste .
she is n't my cousin .	it does n't make any difference what she is : you like her .
how in hell does it wind up ?	i think i 'd better go tomorrow .
you see how much you like her ?	that 's life . some people are brought together , others are separated . what can we do , if that 's the way it happens ?
maybe afterwards he 'll let me ...	if you free me , you 'll be a rich man ...
me , rich ? come on !	there 's plenty of money in this house . piles of it .
i do n't want you to untie me . kill him and then i 'll give you the money .	where 's the dough ?
kill him .	that will teach you not to bother me any more , you son of a bitch .
he was very good . better than some people would think .	why did he kill himself ?
i do n't know , sir .	one should n't be alone the whole time . i 'm not like him , am i ?
and this chest ?	there are some curtains and drapes , but they 're all very old .
i do n't know ; i ca n't remember . but i 'm sure he loved you .	why ?
you would n't be here otherwise .	these chairs are in good condition . with a little varnish and some new covers this one will be quite presentable .
i do n't know -- they 've always been there .	that 's stupid ! plaster ! it can still be used .
miss viridiana ...	are you jorge ?
jorge , don jaime 's son , at your service .	i 've been expecting you ; i got a letter from the lawyer .
jorge . you frightened me . what 's happening to you ?	it 's about time we spoke to each other , is n't it ?
well ... is it so urgent ?	if i wait until tomorrow , it 'll be the same as yesterday and the day before and all the other days . when you 're not with your poor people , you 're praying or you disappear , i never see you .
i do n't know anything about these things , jorge ...	but you have a right to let us know what you think .
what do you know about me ?	i know that you used to work with an architect .
i do n't understand how you can like being alone so much .	i 'm not like you , you have your wife .
what are you doing here ? get out .	leave him alone .
you wo n't get much done with those people . those times are over ! you ought to let me kick them out .	do they worry you that much , then ?
there 's no point in helping some of them when there are so many others .	i know perfectly well how little i can do . what i want to do is give passing beggars a roof , some food , and a bit of human warmth .
is that all you 're going to devote your life to ?	i 'm not sure yet . i 've had a shock recently , and i 'm only beginning to get over it . perhaps i 'll go back to the convent one day .
are they going to work here too ?	do n't worry . nobody 's going to disturb you .
do n't forget the meeting with the lawyer . the car will pick you up tomorrow morning .	i 'll be ready .
yes . why ?	you can come and live again in the big house if you want . now that i 'm alone , i can settle down anywhere .
and ... your friend ?	she 's left .
is she coming back ?	no .
it 's for people !	then let him go and he 'll follow you .
he 's good at rabbiting and he knows it . when we 're in the country , if he does n't hunt he does n't get fed .	how much do you want for him ?
and remember , the less he eats , the better he runs .	what 's he called ?
they 're varicose veins , miss , but some days i ca n't take care of them .	are you sure it is n't contagious ?
they 're varicose veins . it is n't leprosy .	i 'll take him to the doctor tomorrow . come on now , sit down and go on eating . and you , look after him as if he were a sick brother . be understanding . now finish eating and then go to bed . everyone in bed by eight o'clock !
how are you today ?	things seem to be getting better .
are your parents alive ?	parents ? nobody cares a damn , what 's the use of them !
do n't say that .	right , i wo n't say that , but i still think they 're no use .
you 'll soon find out , you liar !	stop this !
how do you do , miss viridiana !	is anything the matter , mr. mayor ?
you can not leave ...	why not ?
there 's been an accident .	where ?
why are you crying ?	i 'm afraid .
do n't invent stories ; go to bed .	a black bull came .
it 's a very big one .	very , very ?
yes -- very , very big !	he could n't get through the door , then ?
he came in through the cupboard .	you little liar ! get out of here !
i 'll box your ears if you do n't show some respect for the dead ! you must n't play under this tree .	don jaime loved to watch me skip .
have you repaired the windows of the dormitories ?	they shut all right now . and the blankets are ready .
what 's going on , moncho ?	this louse is looking for trouble .
in you go ! moncho , lead the way ! you stay here .	but , miss ...
you have decided to leave , moncho .	yes !
mother ?	i 've just had a letter from your uncle . he wo n't be able to come when you take your vows .
i hardly know him . i saw him only once , some years ago . i ca n't even remember him .	in any case he 's asking you to come and stay with him .
i do n't want to leave the convent , mother .	i 'm afraid that his health is not good . he 's your only relative and you ought to say farewell to him before taking your vows . you will certainly never see him again .
but why does he want to see me ? he has never bothered about me .	he has paid for your studies and your maintenance , and he has just sent your dowry . does that mean so little to you , viridiana ?
i have no desire to see the world again , but if you order me to ...	the retreat will start soon . you can leave tomorrow morning .
good morning . you were n't expecting me , were you ?	mother .
ever since yesterday , when we heard by chance about the tragedy , we have been very anxious for you . why did n't you write ? i would have come immediately .	i had so many things to think about !
is there some grave impediment which prevents you from taking your vows ? there must be something .	i have nothing to reproach myself for . all i know is that i 've changed . with all my strength , which is not much , i will follow the road that the lord has shown me . one can also serve outside a convent .
forgive me if i have offended you .	you are forgiven . goodbye .
give the little girl to me . come here , sweetheart . are you ready ?	when you are , miss .
do n't talk like that !	i 'll talk the way i want to . i 've had enough of this .
would you mind telling me what i did wrong to you to deserve your insults ?	i 've had a gutful of this .
she has the face of an angel . what a pity you ca n't see her .	right , let 's go . and keep the compliments to yourself . i do n't like them .
what about you , manuel ?	i 'm only good at making people laugh .
she looks like a sick marrow !	do n't pay any attention to him . it 's very good .
ask the priest , miss .	that 's enough . go join the others , and do n't come back here . and you 'll have to control your temper .
welcome , miss . i 'm ramona , don jaime 's servant .	ah ! pleased to meet you .
how do you feel ?	i have a headache .
what happened to me ?	you fainted last night after supper . the master and i carried you here .
have i slept long ?	oh , you slept well ; do n't worry .
hello .	hello .
good morning , rita . how are we today ?	today , a good girl .
what ?	yes , yes , i saw you !
how did you see me ?	from the terrace .
i 'm going to the hen house . are you coming with me ?	no , i do n't want to .
) daryl lindenmeyer was only here briefly , one semester at most . but he was singularly the most brilliant student i ever had in a classroom . he created programs so beautiful , so lyrical , they were almost like symphonies ...	can you tell us what 's on the disc ?
in english , please .	i accidently triggered a protection mechanism which erased the entire program .
it was very wellhidden . there was no way to see it until it was too late .	it 's not your fault . we appreciate you trying .
you son-ofabitch , i 'm going to kill you .	me ? what did i do ?
i 'm sorry , i thought you were somebody else .	i 've discovered something about lindenmeyer'5 maestro teaching tool i thought you should know ... the harm done to the music students who used the device it was not by accident . the machine was designed explicitly for that purpose . lindenmeyer intended to hurt the kids using it .
my first two pairs of convicts suffered the same fate .	why was n't i told ?
we do n't know how , but sid 6.7 made himself into an android .	you mean a nanotech synthetic organism .
recognize this ? how would you like your old job back ?	catch him and your record 's clean .
this is the newest technology approved for general implementation . it 's called a locater implant . every parolee gets one . we 're going to know where you are every second for the rest of your life .	if you try to run , i 'll hunt you down and kill you myself .
there 's already a task force out looking for lindenmeyer . every other officer in the city will be hunting sid right along with you .	but only you will know he 's not human .
what are they doing in los feliz ?	madison lives two blocks from their present location .
why would they be going there ?	i do n't know .
barnes would n't kill two innocent guards .	he would slaughter eight people sitting in a room , but not two prison guards ?
do i need to remind you what happened to his wife ? to his daughter ? i will stake my reputation that barnes did n't kill those guards .	you already have staked your reputation . mayor bennett and i have been friends a long time . since grimes tried to kill him , it does n't take a rocket scientist to come to the conclusion that sid 6.7 might go after him , too . bennett 's re-election rally is tomorrow night and we already have enough trouble on our hands with one psychotic on the loose . the fail-safe online , yet ?
you all right ?	why'd.. .you pull me out ?
what the hell did you have to shoot the busboy for ?	he was a computer program for crissake .
you were supposed to act as if everything was real .	real , my ass . it 's an overblown game . anybody ever catch that fucking psycho ?
before you , nobody else had gotten close enough to sid 6.7 to take a shot at him . hell , nobody else had even been able to start tracking him before he got to them first . new scar you making it okay in there ?	i 'm getting by .
but with the six months off i get for being your guinea pig , i 've only got to survive another 17 years , 5 months , and 23 days .	do n't give up , parker . not ever .
you know those cheesy christmas cards of your family under that tree in your back yard you keep sending me every year ?	what about them ?
you 're wasting your time . i 'm not going to play any more of your goddam games .	parker barnes , i 'd like you to meet crime czar elizabeth deane .
these were taken inside letac an hour ago . pretty pictures , are n't they ?	i 've seen worse .
jesus christ . can you kill it ?	if you can catch him .
she 's going to help you understand what makes sid 6.7 tick .	what she 's going to do is get in my way .
this is the personnel file on the programmer , lindenmeyer . there might be something in it you can use .	she was n't part of the deal , cox .
officers in toluca lake just found an affluent couple ... completely gutted . so were the first two cops to arrive on scene .	their weapons missing ?
sid 6.7 is now armed .	where 's my gun ?
do n't worry , they have no idea where you are .	you sonofabitch . how could you let them put the implant in my head ? how ?
she saved your life , parker . she did n't have to , but she did .	then i guess we 're even .
when this is over , will you get this goddam thing out of my head ?	on my life , i promise you i will .
... illegal search of lindenmeyer ' s duplex . eleven civilian vehicles damaged or destroyed . twentyfour citizen complaints . and the calls are just starting to come in ... i forgot what it 's like to have you on the streets .	any sign of lindenmeyer ?
none . he could be hiding , he could be helping sid , or could be in little pieces on santa monica beach . any idea what sid 's going to do next ?	until we know what new influences are affecting him , we ca n't be sure .
i should have told him .	do n't blame yourself . in your shoes , i do n't think i would have told parker , either . so do you think grimes has become the dominant personality ?
i 'm not sure . my guess is that 's what sid wants us to think .	you think he 's smart ?
there is no way parker killed those guards . no way .	i think we both know who did . what 's so urgent ?
why did n't anybody tell me ? !	i do n't set policy . you have the key ?
give me 30 seconds , then flip every switch you can reach .	got it .
ms. deane , you wanted to see me ?	we have an emergency situation which requires somebody with expertise in criminal psychology . under the authority vested in me by the president , i 'm giving you temporary reassignment .
what 's the assignment ?	you 're going to put your theories to practice . i 'm sending you into the field .
that 's also where mr. barnes lost his arms to mathew grimes ' booby trap . what 's your point , dr. carter ?	letting a lunatic like parker barnes loose in the free world is like lighting a fuse . at some point , he will go off -- you saw what happened in the simulator . the risk to the public is unacceptably dangerous .
not if you 're with him every step of the way .	the man played judge , jury , and executioner with eight people 's lives . he lost control and is capable of doing it again .
i watched your simulation , mr. barnes . very impressive . you know , you 're the only one to ever go up against sid 6.7 who is still alive .	only because i got pulled out early .
think you can do it ?	not from in here .
what happens if i ca n't catch him ?	if sid 6.7 has n't killed you , we throw you back in here and you serve out the rest of your sentence .
barnes , where the hell have you been ? !	trying to find out where the bomb is . where the hell have you been ?
what did you find out ?	call off the manhunt looking for me . i did n't kill the transport guards .
it 's already been called off . witnesses confirmed you were n't the shooter . did you find out where the bomb is ?	no , but i 've confirmed the reelection rally is the target . how much c-4 is missing ?
enough to level an entire city block .	if i were you , i 'd get every demolition team in the city searching in and around the biltmore hotel .
demolition teams have searched everywhere in and around the hotel . i do n't know where ...	sid is smart enough to know you 'd check everywhere in the immediate area . whatever the device is , he 's probably got it timed to move into position just before it detonates . have the demo teams check every subway tunnel , water pipe , gas pipe , and sewer pipe that goes under , over , or into the arena .
you know how much man power you 're talking about ?	you 're the highest law enforcement official in the country . use the fucking army if you need to .
this better not be a wild goose chase .	or what , you 'll authorize my death a second time today ?
what did cox pull him out early for ?	barnes used to work for him when he was still a cop in the field , remember ?
what the hell happened ?	lindenmeyer developed neural connectors that tap directly into the nervous system . if the simulator is n't calibrated properly , experiencing death in this level of vr is like experiencing death within a dream . the experience becomes real .
simulations are supposed to give participants practice in realistic , dangerous scenarios while protecting them from the risks they are exposed to in the real world .	i was assured the problem was corrected .
it makes me nervous just seeing him in a uniform . i will never forget the first time i saw the photos from the crime scene .	neither will the public . the media has caught wind of his pardon . unless mr. barnes starts giving me some tangible results , i 'm going to put him back in his cage .
you embarrassed me in front of the highestranking law enforcement official in the country . do you have any idea how much money you just cost me ?	the reason you insisted on testing my system with prisoners is because of the increased risks involved with increased realism .
of the six prison inmates you 've tested all of whom have had at least some military or survival training - only mr. barnes is still breathing .	i 'm still making adjustments ...
you 've had a yearandahalf to make all the adjustments you want , lindenmeyer . ) elizabeth deane does not give second chances . neither do i. you 're fired .	i 'm what ? !
you are to turn over the sid 6.7 program , and all its documentation , for immediate destruction . is that understood ?	i understand ... i understand perfectly .
how does he know who i am ?	he hears ... everything .
hey ! ! !	show 's over unless i get to see what you 've been working on after hours .
i have n't been working on anything .	do i get to see it or not ?
get that fucking thing away from me !	you 're ... such a wimp .
watching your vr people auto reset gave me the idea .	it 's nanotechnology , is n't it ? machines the size of molecules ...
coordinated by polymer neural net .	it feels so.. .real .
it 's better than real . it 's synthetic flesh . synthetic blood . synthetic organs ... it 's a physiological machine .	this is supposed to be years away .
as far as the public is concerned , it is . the reason you got fired , and i got my second demo into production , is i 'm a lot smarter than you . i never give my best stuff away .	how do you kill it ?
... and you get nanodeath . do n't worry , i 've got a bunch of other ones .	amazing . i hate to say it , but it is .
you need a maid .	what i need is a nymphomaniac .
i told you this would work.. by setting back the clocks , he has absolutely no idea he 's in virtual reality . he still thinks he 's in the real world .	what 's wrong with parker ?
how should i know ?	show me his physical sensory level .
i wonder how that ...	turn it down !
he 's developing a hemisphere imbalance .	talk so i can understand .
if i do n't adjust the level of neural information each side of his brain is receiving , he wo n't be able to walk when i take him out of vr .	then fix it .
do n't be angry with me , daryl .	did you recognize the son-of-a bitch who got away ?
should i have ?	think hard -- it 'll come to you ...
all they want to produce around here is mediocrity !	true genius is rarely rewarded within its lifetime .
it was you , was n't it ?	it was me , what ?
you amped the neural connectors back up , did n't you ? you 're the reason the convict died . you 're the reason i got fired !	i could n't just let them make you bring down my degree of difficulty . i 'm a triple-twisting , double back flip off the high platform , not a swan dive .
my god ...	which god would that be , the one who created me , or the one who created you ? in your world , the lord giveth , and the lord taketh away . but in my world , the one who gave me life does n't have the balls to stop a couple of bureaucratic assholes from taking it away .
what do you expect me to do , put your character module in my pocket and just walk you out of here ?	i had something a little different in mind . instead of just playing peeping tom with reilly , why do n't you get him to show you what he 's been working on after hours ?
she 's some of your finest work , daryl .	all my work is my finest .
you catching my drift ?	i think i understand what you have in mind ...
sid no ! ! !	what do you expect me to do , thank him ?
i am beautiful , are n't i ?	of course you are .
how can i ever thankyou for bringing me back to life a second time , daryl ?	help me get out of here .
you made me a composite of 183 of the most vicious people who ever lived . what do you think i 'm doing ?	i 'm begging you ... please do n't kill me ! please !
you actually listen to all those tapes ?	no , i just like the effect a tape recorder has on you . how you feeling today ?
a little less than yesterday .	in other words , par for the course . how do you feel about the simulation you participated in yesterday ?
john died .	i know . i was there . i saw the whole thing . if i was your therapist , i would have advised you against putting yourself back into that kind of situation .
you 're not my therapist . you 're hear to study me . face it i 'm nothing more than a lab rat to you .	that 's not true , parker .
if i had died yesterday , you 'd have already dissected my brain and analyzed it to see if i carry any genetic predisposition toward violence .	what was going through your mind when you killed the busboy ?
not much . he was just a computer program . nothing more .	you did n't see the expression you had on your face when you pulled the trigger . but i did . you kind of liked it , did n't you ? that thrill of going over the edge again . of taking out an innocent bystander or two , as long as you got the target ...
go to hell .	it was just like before , was n't it ? was n't it ? but you are making progress . instead of killing seven people to get the one you 're after , this time there was only one other person involved .
i need to know what snapped in you . what made you capable of it . you have to make me understand .	i do n't have to do anything except survive . and it 's taking everything i 've got just to do that .
i do n't need a babysitter .	what you need is a collar .
every day for the last five years , i told myself someday i would be out here again . no more bars . no more guards . no more fights just to stay alive . every day for the last five years , i told myself that lie .	it was n't a lie .
you all right ?	fine . never felt better in my life . see , i 'm a good liar .
you ready for this ?	do n't worry . if i ca n't handle it , i 'll just kill everybody .
he was reenacting charles manson 's labianca murders .	manson did n't kill the first cops to arrive on the scene .
whoever did this wanted to do charlie one better to improve upon what was already done .	charlie ? you say that like you 're close , personal friends .
i 've spent over 50 hours interviewing him . charlie killed leno and rosemary labianca because of the ugly way the members of his family had butchered sharon tate . after seeing the blood bath on television , he wanted to show them how it should be done . the question is , what does charlie have to do with sid 6.7 ?	i know who would know .
learn anything from lindenmeyer 's file ?	he had a twin brother who was a musical child prodigy who died in an electrical accident at age eight . lindenmeyer went into an emotional shell until was 17. all he did day and night was play the violin .
what happened when he was 17 ?	every music school in the country rejected him and he turned to computers . stay here .
you 've got a problem with me carrying a gun ?	do me one favor if you shoot at anything , make sure i 'm nowhere near it .
what are you doing ?	checking my pulse . it 's elevated . you enjoy frightening me , do n't you ?
this lindenmeyer 's a real piece of work .	maybe after they catch him , you should write a book about him ...
i 'm surprised you did n't write one about me .	i 'm still working on it .
remember a few years ago when music schools were using a computerized teaching tool that accidently started frying kids ' brains ?	i 've been in prison , remember ?
the government must have figured there was no better person to create a psycho than a psycho .	just like they figured there was no better person to catch one ...
i am the demon from the bottomless pit ...	... here on earth to create havoc and terror . i am war , i am death . i am destruction . david berkowitz , 1977 .
i am impressed .	for murder , though it have no tongue , will speak with most miraculous organ .
who said that ?	hamlet . what 's david berkowitz got to do with sid 6.7 ?
lindenmeyer put increasingly complex combinations of criminal psychological profiles together to develop the ultimate villain .	creating a whole far more dangerous than the sum of its parts .
this is getting you pumped up , is n't it ? this is like the world series to you .	as a matter of fact , it is .
remember the bowling ball bag sid carried with him in virtual reality ?	dahmer carried the head of one of his victims in a bowling bag for over a week . kept it in his locker while he was at work in a candy factory . we need to get a look at sid 6.7 's final profile .
what we need to do is stop playing with computers and go catch the sonof-a-bitch before he kills anybody else .	in order to find him , we have to understand what makes him tick ...
give me your wrist .	give me a goddam break . i 'm not going to go anywhere alone .
told you i was n't going to go anywhere .	how did you get your hand out ?
why did n't you tell me you had a daughter ?	i prefer keeping my professional life separate from my personal life .
she 's beautiful , you know ?	thank-you . her name is karin .
want to tell me the real reason we stopped at your house ?	i told you , it was on the way and i wanted to change clothes .
you should practice lying more often . you 're awful at it . where to ?	sid 6.7 is no longer bound by his programming .
what does that mean ?	now that he 's in the real world , there are no longer limitations on his behavior like there were in virtual reality . sid is going to evolve .
sounds to me like a welleducated way of saying you have no idea what to do next .	what i do know is that whatever he 's becoming , sid 6.7 is going to be even worse than he was before .
i forgot what real coffee tastes like ...	you know , considering you 've only been out of prison for seven hours , you 're readapting quite well . wait , i did n't mean that the way it sounded . i meant ...
do n't worry about it , all right ?	dammit , i hate sounding so clinical all the time . all i meant to say was i thought you were doing well , but then i ...
relax . i know what you meant .	i ruin so many moments by analyzing them when i should just be living them .
do n't get out of the car .	stop me .
what the hell 's going on ? !	this is my area of expertise .
what did you do to those people ?	nothing .
being on the street 's a little different than sitting in an office all day , is n't it ?	enjoying yourself ?
you know i am .	this is n't a game , parker !
what 's the problem ?	i 'm doing the best i can !
whatever he was doing here was only the start .	start of what ?
it 's not just sid 6.7 's performances that are increasing . stars need bigger and bigger audiences . whatever sid is going to do next , it 's going to involve media .	you like baseball ?
real effective security ...	you could have just flashed him your badge , you know ?
which way ?	both .
parker - stop ! stop ! do n't make me shoot you	if you 're gon na do it , better do it now .
grimes is back ! he 's back ! he 's come back ! ! !	no ! grimes is n't back . he 's only one part of sid . sid 6.7 is a hell of a lot worse than grimes ever was . get a hold of yourself !
we know you did n't kill those guards .	they 're going to fry me for it , anyway .
he did n't know about the neural toxin . i did .	you knew the entire time ? can you give me one good reason why i should n't kill you right now ?
how did you find out about the toxin ?	sid 6.7 told me after he killed the two guards . he suggested i kill you rather than him .
you 're not capable of it .	i pose an unacceptable danger to the public , remember ?
the rally 's a little obvious as a target , do n't you think ?	i told you before , grimes liked to be obvious .
sid 6.7 is n't grimes .	part of him is .
if we find sid , lindenmeyer wo n't be far behind .	think he 's keeping track of his creation ?
see something ?	i 'm not sure ... on the bridge ... the guy at the payphone ...
nice work .	thanks .
find out anything ?	a bomb 's going off tomorrow night , but i have no idea where .
can i ask you something ?	you mean there 's something you have n't asked me ?
you 've already fulfilled the terms of your pardon . you stopped sid 6.7 and you 've got his module . you 're free to go right now . why are you going to do this ?	you do n't know ?
that 's why i 'm asking .	because this painintheass criminal psychology expert has helped me understand what i 'm capable of . and what i 'm not . and better than anyone else , i am capable of stopping sid 6.7 .
you okay ?	... i think so ... you ?
more or less .	lindenmeyer ?
my guess is dead .	sid ?
where the hell are you going ?	lindenmeyer never got over wanting to kill kids with more musical than he had ...
how 's your pulse ?	i could n't tell you .
then shoot him already .	duck !
what do we do now ?	you wo n't want to watch . turn around .
where 's john ?	performing solo . enjoying the concert so far ?
the symphony of collision ...	the only thing i want to hear is your silence .
you and me have nothing in common .	who else do you know who touches the world with synthetic hands ?
you ... mother ... fucker ! i 'm going to kill you ! ! !	now , is that any way to talk to an old buddy ? i mean , just because i 'm carrying around the joy of killing your family inside me does n't mean we ca n't be friends .
i 'm sorry , the party you 're trying to reach is not answering . is there anyone else you would like to talk to ?	dead ! you hear me ?
i would n't pull the trigger if i were you	why 's that ?
what c-4 ... was cox talking about ?	let me put it to you this way ... whether i 'm here ... or whether i 'm not ... i 'm leaving an indelible mark on the world tomorrow night .
what c-4 ... was cox talking about ?	let me put it to you this way ... whether i 'm here ... or whether i 'm not ... i 'm leaving an indelible mark on the world tomorrow night .

sir larry wildman . like all brits he thinks he was born with a better pot to piss in ... bribed an old secretary of mine to open bar mouth and stole rdl pharmaceuticals right out from under me . wildman the white knight .	i remember that deal . you were involved ?
revenge is a dish best served cold ... well , it 's payback time , sport . ... see that building ? i bought into it ten years ago . it was my first real estate deal . i sold it a couple of years later and made an $ 800,000 dollar profit . it was better than sex . at that time i thought that was all tne money in the world ... now , it 's a day 's pay ... i had a mole in wildman 's employ . gave me half the picture , then he got fired ...	i do n't understand .
wildman 's in town . he just became an american citizen . something big 's about to go down . i want to know where he goes and who he sees . i want you , sport , to give me the missing half of the picture ...	follow him ? mr. gekko i ... it 's not what i do . i could lose my license . if the sec found out , i could go to jail . it 's inside information , is n't it ?
what about hard work ?	what about it ? you work hard . i 'll bet you stayed up all night analyzing that dog you bought . and where 'd it get you ? ... my father worked hard too like an elephant pushing electrical supplies . and he dropped dead at 49 with a heart attack and a tax bill and the bank pissed on his grave and took the house ; my mom ended up working in a dish factory ... wake up pal , if you 're not inside you 're outside . and i 'm not talking a $ 200,000 a year working wall street stiff flying first class and being `` comfortable '' , i 'm talking rich pal , rich enough to fly in your own jet , rich enough not to waste time , 50-100 million , a player bud -- or nothing . you had what it takes to let through my door . next question : you got what it takes to stay ... ? ?
i got all i could get which was 750,000 shares plus 5000 march 50 calls . average price of $ 47 a share and $ 4 per contract for the call . i just wish i could 've got more .	do n't expect to get it all , sport , you 'll burn out . first rule of business is never get emotional about stock , clouds the judgment . where do we stand ?
i 'll be right there , fix them a drink .	... we have 37.2 million invested . at this point , we 're up 3.1 million and some change . if it goes to 75 bucks we can clean close to 12 mill .
you 're walking between the raindrops kid . i expect sir larry is choking on his royal chamber pot by now .	my firm needs your signature on these option agreements tonight , sir , otherwise we could take a real bath tomorrow .
sorry , mr. gekko .	allright . wait here ...
i guess i 'll head back ...	stick around ... larry , one of my `` gang '' -- bud fox .
the break up value is higher . it 's worth 80 .	but we do n't want to be greedy now , so let 's let him have it at $ 72 .
he 's right . i had to sell . the key to the game is your capital reserves . you do n't have enough , you ca n't pee in the tall weeds with the big dogs .	`` all warfare is based on deception ... '' sun tzu says , if your enemy is superior , evade him , if angry , irritate him , if equally matched , fight ... if not , split and reevaluate .
money never sleeps pal . when i came in in '69 , they traded six hours a day , now the clock do n't stop , london 's deregulated , the orient is hungrier than us . just let the money circle the world , sport , buying and selling , and if you 're smart it comes back paying . i just made $ 800,000 in hong kong gold . it 's been wired to you -- play with it . you done good , but you got ta keep doing good . i showed you how the game works , now school 's out .	mr. gekko , i 'm there for you 110 % .
you do n't understand . i want to be surprised ... astonish me , sport , new info , do n't care where or how you get it , just get it ... my wife tells me you put a move on darien . here 's some inside info for you . that euroflash gq guy she 's going with 's got big bucks but he 's putting her feet to sleep . exit visas are imminent . so do n't lose your place in line . oh , jeez , i wish you could see this . the lights coming up over the water . i 've never seen a painting that captures the beauty of the ocean at this moment . ... an old russian proverb - `` a fisherman always sees another fisherman from afar . '' i like you sport , i ever tell you that ... gordon , call me gordon from now on .	... gordon .
got him at an auction in kentucky .	how much ?
the art of which is deception . spread the buy orders through different accounts and you wo n't get burned ...	i think i got some friends that wo n't mind making some easy money ...
mixed emotions , buddy : like larry wildman going off a cliff in my new maserati . men as smart as myself have got their asses handed to them on a sling with the airlines , fuel could go up , unions are killers ...	yeah are n't you forgetting something gordon : rule one , capital reserves . this company has $ 75 million cash in an overfunded pension . that buys us a lot of credibility ... ... and the beauty is you already own close to two percent of this sucker ...
gordon what i want -- and i never asked you for anything -- is to be your co-pilot on this . i want to take this airline , turn it around , and make it work . it 's gon na make us a fortune !	i 'm talking to a stockbroker who wants to run an airline . it 's gon na take me two years and 2000 headaches to turn teldar paper around , what do i need this dink airline for ? i 'm up to my ass in more nuts than a fruitcake .
gordon , i worked at bluestar , i know my way around , i have friends there ... inside .	what does that mean ?
the three unions . it 's 43 % of bluestar 's operating budget , the hourly cost of a flight crew is $ 850 an hour , that 's the real hidden value g.g. , if you can negotiate that out , get a crew down to $ 350-400 an hour a run , this airline is gon na be the hottest thing since texas air ...	what makes you think you can ?
i can talk to these people gordon , they trust me ... and my father can be a big help in getting cuts .	alright ... susan , get buckingham on the box . i want him to look at it . and tell jock taylor at thwick , jensen ... so sport , the falcon has heard the falconer ... tell me more ...
and i 'd like to introduce you to mr. gekko , and his lawyer , mr. salt .	a pleasure to meet you , mr. fox .
now , wait a minute , dad ...	sure . what 's worth doing is worth doing for money . it 's a bad bargain where nobody gains . and if this deal goes through , we all gain .
i did n't know we had a meeting schedule for this morning .	i 'm sorry , this ca n't wait .
what the hell do you want ?	i found out about the garage sale down at bluestar . why ?
last night i read rudy the story of winnie the pooh and the honey pot . know what happened : he stuck his nose in that honey pot once too often and got stung .	maybe you ought to read him pinocchio . you told me you were going to turn bluestar around . not upside down . you used me .
you 're walking around blind without a cane , sport . a fool and his money are lucky to get together in the first place .	why do you need to wreck this company ?
because it 's wreckable . i took another look and i changed my mind .	if these people lose their jobs , nowhere to go . my father worked at bluestar for twenty-four years . i gave 'em my word .
it 's all about bucks , kid , the rest is conversation ... bud , you 're still going to be president . and when the time comes , you 'll parachute out a rich man . with the money you 're going to make , your father wo n't have to work another day in his life .	tell me , gordon -- when does it all end ? how many yachts can you waterski behind ? how much is enough ?
buddy , it 's not a question of enough . it 's a zero sum game , sport . somebody wins and somebody loses . money itself is n't lost or made , it 's simply transferred from one perception to another . like magic . that painting cost $ 60,000 10 years ago . i could sell it today for $ 600,000 . the illusion has become real . and the more real it becomes , the more desperately they want it . capitalism at its finest .	how much is enough gordon ?
the richest one percent of this country owns half the country 's wealth : 5 trillion dollars . one third of that comes from hard work , two thirds of it comes from inheritance , interest on interest accumulation to widows and idiot sons and what i do -- stock and real estate speculation . it 's bullshit . ninety percent of the american people have little or no net worth . i create nothing ; i own . we make the rules , buddy , the news , war , peace , famine , upheaval ; the cost of a paper clip . we pull the rabbit out of the hat while everybody else sits around their whole life wondering how we did it ... ... you 're not naive enough to think we 're living in a democracy are you , buddy ? it 's the free market . you 're one of us now ... take advantage of it . you got the killer instinct , kid , stick with me . i got things to teach you ...	obviously ...
believe me , buddy , i was gon na discuss this with you at the right time . look , why do n't you calm down and come to the apartment for dinner tonight . bring darien ...	... i ca n't make it tonight .
gordon , it 's two minutes to close . what do you want to do ? ! decide .	dump it .
hello bud .	gordon .
hello again , i been holding these drinks for us for the last three weeks .	excuse me .
grand marnier . a romantic and tragic drink .	oh yes , i remember you .
destiny took us apart , but i knew it would bring us back together .	aha . poet or philosopher ?
i 'd give anything to have this in my house , even for a week .	... few thousand dollars down the drain if you ask me .
oh really ? well , i guess you can kiss that career as an art appraiser goodbye , because we paid over four hundred thousand for it at the contemporary picture sale last june .	you could have a great beach house for that .
sure you could , in wildwood , new jersey . if you sold this , you could have a pretty nice penthouse on fifth . but you would n't have much left over for decoration .	boy , i thought gordon was a tough businessman , but somebody 's really taking him to the cleaners here .
not really . i 'd say that gordon is one of the most astute collectors around . he has a great eye and he only buys the best . like this rug for instance , a silk tabriz , the finest of its kind . the day after he bought it in london , a dealer representing the saudi royal family offered him twice what he paid . it absolutely makes the room . see how this little bit of celadon in the border is picked up in the cushions oh the sofa ... although ... i do n't know if i would have used that tea dipped linen for the upholstery - too dingy . and it 's a sacrilege having that pre-columbian pot in the center of the coffee table . some dope might use it as an ashtray .	i gather you 're a decorator .
you got it , a great spender of other people 's money .	well , if you 're that good , you could probably do wonders at my place .
where is it ?	upper west side .
oh really . home of the exposed brick wall and the houseplant .	oh it 's just a rental . i 'm moving to the east side soon . i 've got a couple of deals brewing with gordon . but that 's just conversation ... what about real things ? like dinner . the two of us . friday . cafe . santo domingo .
what if i have a previous engagement ?	break it .
i guess this must be destiny alright . my first yuppie apartment and ... my first yuppie .	you may call me a yuppie ... it 's mister yuppie to you .
so . see you friday .	you really do believe in destiny ?
devon ? he looks like seattle slew . what about the triple crown ?	he 's not a racehorse , bud , he 's a jumper .
if i could have anything ... this would almost do .	yeah , almost ...
so , how did your conference go with gordon ?	the conference , oh yeah . fine . we reached an agreement and decided to divide up the world between us .
you have modest wants . i like that in a man .	and what do you want ?
... a turner , a perfect canary diaiaond ... a lear jet ... world peace ... the best of everything ...	well , why stop at that ?
i do n't .	you 're not trouble by any chance . are you ?
... is n't it perfect !	... too perfect ... let 's not even eat . let 's just watch it and think about it .
you know , the elevator man could n't believe i paid $ 300,000 to have my walls looking like this , he 's got them for free in brooklyn .	i 'll bet he 's got an opinion on the stock market too . this apartment is already ahead of its time . i call it the `` demolished '' look . they 've already heard about it at house and garden and they 're coming next week to photograph it before it gets ... lived in . is that alright ? i 'd love to have it in my portfolio .
let 's get things straight , bud . i 'm not going to take a cut . i worked hard and you ca n't decorate a room in new york for less than $ 100,000 . curtains alone ...	i 'm kidding , i 'm kidding , we 're still young , darien . so what 's money anyway when everybody 's making it , it 's all relative . after all , this is not the house in connecticut , this is just a crash pad good for a couple of years ... before we slip our two lovely kids , yuppie and fruppie into the lycee francaise .
you got it all charted out do n't you , like a stock projection .	that 's right -- one with high yield , rich assets and no downside ...
do you think you 're ready ?	it 's not me i 'm worried about ... you know darien , the only reason we have n't slept together is because we both know we will -- and not knowing when was the only surprise left . you owe me , i want you , what else is there ... but you , me , the world . ... right here ... make love to me ... now ... stop me if i 'm going too far .
bud , i hate to tell you this but you 're a genius ! darien ... lightning has struck ! the lightbulb has been invented . edison , da vinci , einstein are watching ...	... are you going to trade all night again ? you got to go to work in a couple of hours .
i love you , baby . did i tell you that sometime in the last 24 hours ?	get in bed . y'ever hear of the sixty hour work week ? you 're turning into a yuppie frankenstein , you love money so much .
sure , why not , money 's the sex of the 80 's . i never had it like you when i was growing up , baby , it was n't the upper east side .	you 're so naive bud , you do n't even know . your dad took care of you . i might 've been rich when i was a kid ... but my father lost all his money ... in the seventies , in the stock market , at the track . he was a lousy gambler ...
... that changes all my plans , i thought you were loaded ...	so did i , till i hit 19 and found i had all the royal habits and no throne . mom got by but i had to go to work just like you . only the skills i had were shopping and making friends . so ... that 's why i do what i do , what makes you tick , buddy ?
i 'm sorry . i was afraid something like this could happen .	talk about being bent over the sink of life and being dry humped . i handed it to him on a silver platter . i told my father and those people ...
buddy , it 's not your fault , and it 's not your decision .	i 'm not gon na let it happen darien .
do n't cross gordon . he 'll crush you . you 've worked hard to get where you are . if gordon does n't buy bluestar someone else will ; and who 's to say they wo n't do the same thing .	at least i would n't be pulling the trigger .
are you mad ! why are you doing this ! we 're so close , the town is going to be ours . do n't throw away your future bud !	i can stay with the brokerage firm . and you 're doing fine . we can survive without gordon gekko .
i 'm not looking to just survive . i 've been doing that all my life .	what the hell 's that supposed to mean ?
you really mean that ? what 'd he promise you ? to take you public ? i guess without gordon 's money and seal of approval , i 'm not such a hot investment anymore . you 're just the best money can buy , darien ...	you 're not exactly pure bud , you went after gekko with the same vengeance you went after me . look in the mirror before ...
you may not believe this bud but i really do care for you . i think we could 've made a good team ... but that 's how it goes ...	get the hell out !
hi .	why ?
how you doing buddy ?	great carolyn , doing any better would be a sin ...
morning buddy , you look happy .	any better and i 'd be guilty .
you were never that innocent sugarpie .	... how do you know ? you wish ...
bud ! where you been the last two days ?	... janet get my father on the phone and the two other union reps , urgent ...
he had a heart attack , hon , but he 's okay , he 's at the hospital ...	oh christ !
you got a look in your eye , mr. mannheim ... you got something for the small fry ...	jesus , ca n't make a buck in this market , country 's going to hell faster than when that sonofabitch roosevelt was around ... too much cheap money sloshing around the world . the biggest mistake we ever made was letting nixon get off the gold standard . putney drug -- you boys might want to have a look at it .
sleep with me and the secrets of the west are yours .	now that 's a crap company , sure you 'll make money on the takeover rumor , but what 's being created . nothing . no substance behind it .
mr. mannheim , got a sure thing . anacott steel .	no such thing bud - 'cept death and taxes . not a good company anymore , no fundamentals . what 's going on bud ? do you know something ? remember there 're no short cuts son , quick buck artists come and go with every bull market but the steady players make it through the bear markets . you 're part of something here , bud . the money you make for people creates science and research jobs . do n't sell that out .
you 're right , mr. mannheim , but you got ta get to the big time first , then you can be a pillar and do good things .	ca n't get a little bit pregnant , bud .
you 're on a roll kiddo . enjoy it while it lasts -- 'cause it never does .	... just kickin ' ass and taking names , mr. mannheim .
i thought this was an informal meeting . what 's he doing here ?	harold , you do n't mind strolling around the block a couple hundred times , do you ?
frankly , carl , i ca n't see giving much more . if you have any suggestions i 'll be glad to listen .	there came into egypt a pharoah who did not know .
i beg your pardon . is that a proverb ?	no , it 's a prophecy . the rich have been doing it to the poor since the beginning of time . the only difference between the pyramids and the empire state building is that the egyptians did n't have unions . i know what this guy is about -- greed -- he 's in and out for the buck and he do n't take prisoners . he do n't give a damn about northstar or us ...
fine , if you do n't want us , stay with the scum in present management -- dedicated to running you and bluestar into the ground .	... that `` scum '' built this company up from one plane in thirty years , they made something out of nothing , and if that 's a scum i 'll take one over a rat any day ...
what do you say we go get a suite at the carlyle ? caviar ? champagne ? celebrate , just like the old times sunshine .	those days are over , gordon . they were over a long time ago .
so what 's the problem sunshine ? you look like black thursday . bad case of puppy love ?	it 's not puppy love , gordon . anyway , buddy and i are splitting up .
sorry to hear that . i thought the kid had staying power .	it 's over you , gordon .
you told him about us ?	no , are you crazy ? and i do n't want him ever to know . do you understand ? ...
i want to ask you a big favor , gordon . please drop the bluestar deal .	now tell me , why would i want to do that ?
because i do n't want to see him hurt .	do n't worry sunshine . bud and i had a little talk . we came to an understanding . i want you to go back to him . soothe him . help keep his head straight . okay ?
i ca n't ... and i wo n't .	come on , we both like buddy . but this bleeding heart puppy love act is over the top ... it does n't fit .
maybe it does . do n't patronize me gordon .	you and i are the same , darien . we 're smart enough not to buy into the oldest myth running : love ... a fiction created by people who got nothing to keep them from jumping out of windows .
you 're really twisted , gordon . you 're incapable of giving to anybody because deep down inside you there 's a poverty that every last dollar in the world wo n't fill .	ooh ooh , tough talk from a scared little girl all wrapped in a pretty grown-up package . does this mean you 're ready to cut the umbilical cord and step out into the world on your own ? because , darien , if you 're through with me , you 're through with everything i 'm a part of .
yeah , billy , who 's your buyer ? ... no , not interested . ollie , start calling a the institutions , start with marx at janson mutual , then reardon . get me that california retirement money , baby ! and we 're on our way !	you got it , g.g .
he respond to the offer ? what ? what the hell 's cromwell doing giving lecture tours when his company 's losing 60 million a quarter ? i guess he 's giving lectures on how to lose money ... if this guy opened a funeral parlor , no one would die , this turkey 's totally brain dead ... well christmas is over and business is business . keep buying . dilute the sonofabitch . ollie i want every orifice in his body flowing red .	he 's flowing , gordo . piece of cake .
... just got 250,000 shares at 18 1/4 from janson , think i 'll pull twice that at 18 1/2 outta the california pensions . we got close to half a million shares in the bag .	hey , the terminator ! blow 'em away ollie .
and , i 'm pretty sure we got the beezer brothers out of tulsa coming in with us and i 'm working on the silverberg boys in canada .	rip their throats out and put them in your garbage compactor . interesting . you got a card ?
rarest pistol in the world , larry , a .45 luger . only six were ever manufactured .	congratulations but rarer still is your interest in anacott steel .
the same interest as yours larry . money . i thought it 'd be a good investment for my kid ...	no . this time i 'm in for the long term . this is not a liquidation , gordon . i 'm going to turn it around . you 're getting a free ride on my tail , mate , and with the dollars you 're costing me to buy back the stock , i could modernize the plant . i 'm not the only one who pays here gordon . we 're talking about lives and jobs ; three and four generations of steel workers ...
you must be wearing a mask you 're laughing so hard behind it larry . let 's cut the `` sir '' crap . correct me if i 'm wrong , but when you took cnx electronics , you laid off 8,000 workers , jessmon fruit about 6,000 , that airline ...	i could break you , mate , in two pieces over my knees , you know it , i know it , i could buy you six times ever , i could dump the stock just to burn your ass but i happen to want the company and i want your block of shares . i 'm announcing a tender offer at 65 tomorrow , and i 'm expecting your commitment .
considering you brought my mother into it , $ 71.50 .	done . you 'll hear from my lawyers . 8 a.m. good night .
with all due respect , mr. gekko , what 's to prevent you from doing the same thing ?	cause i have a way around all this , a way we can all make money and make this airline profitable again . what do you say we cut to the chase . i 'm asking for a modest twenty percent across-the-board wage cut .
are you prepared to put that in writing ?	i 'll have a letter of agreement drawn up within two days .
cards are on the table . what do you think ?	if you mean what you say , i think we 're in the ball park . i 'll take it to my people .
we know what you 're up to , gekko , and let me tell you this from here , you suck eggs , mister , over my dead body you ai n't gon na break up bluestar .	you guys must know something nobody else knows . if those are my plans , it 's the first i 've heard of it .
listen , you clowns , there 's somebody else out there trying to buy your airline , if you want to be pac-manned and gobbled by atilla the hun be my guest !	we 'll take our chances . nice to see you again , mr. gekko .
i saw the greatest movie with mark last night	with mark ?
he still likes you	oh i do n't give a shit the guy 's a slob . he does n't even know how to spell `lady ' let alone treat me like one . you know the last time we went out he actually made me pay for a drink ?
he did ?	yes , i 'm sure . what i need is an older man , something with class , a little style . someone who knows how to treat a lady .
businessman ?	businessman !
doctor ? lawyer ? china lawyer , doctor , i do n't care .	yeah , yeah , ok
yeah	so why are you dating jonathan ?

well that 's for me to know - but i did enjoy rubbing oil all over that big .	just give it a break china ok ? china jeez . ca n't even take a joke
anybody want another drink ?	it 's eleven forty-five let 's go
we need to talk . china yeah about what ?	about what ? about us .

a little what ? china see . you do n't even speak french .	i 'm sorry i 'm not that good at languages ok ?
yeah well why should i suffer for that ?	suffer ? we 're living in america .
well if you 're in such a rush darling , why do n't you lead the way ?	ok toots , i will .
oh mark . it 's ok. it 's ok .	china . what happened ? china shhh . it 's ok. i missed you so much .
weird and tiny huh ?	hi
yes , it 's always been one of my favorites too .	hmm .

yes , i guess you 're right	are you sure you would n't like a closer look ?
your books master loftmore	thank you jenkins
and your coff - excuse me , caffeine sir	thank you
and uh , your nicotine sir	thank you

hello ?	hello , mrs. webster . is china there ?
no jonathan .	no ?
she went to a waxwork party	a party at a waxwork huh ?
can i give her a message ?	you do n't happen to have the address do ya ?
velcome to ve vaxverk .	uh , wrong picture tony .
i hope you enjoyed your visit .	uh yes , thank you . it was quite enjoyable .
two of your friends left earlier mark uh huh .	they seemed , closing by much
tony and china ?	vell . goodnight .
have n't we been doing our homework .	i 've always wondered why someone would believe in something like that .
getting scared ? do n't worry , they 've probably just gone home .	what ? tony and china , together ?
wooo . jealously rearing its ugly head .	i 'm not kidding . i want to get out of here - now , ok .
then why do you still like her ?	like her ? i do n't know if i ever liked her . it 's just you want what you ca n't get .
no mark . mark why not ?	i do n't know . i really like you and i think you 're very attractive .
come on .	no i 'm serious . it 's . it 's just i do n't know i. i 'm looking for something else .
no , no james , it 's not like that . tony and china , they 're just friends .	that 's not what you said last night .
ok , so maybe i was a little over emotional .	a little ?
you are n't sick ! we 've got to get back . what are you doing !	listen sarah , i think i know what 's going on ok. i went to the waxwork today.i met this man .
oh that explains everything .	you do n't understand . i recognized his face now come on .
if my mother caught me up here she 'd kill me .	who 's is all this ?
well ?	well . .this , is mr. lincoln . and that 's the man i saw at the waxwork .
well , it all started when a friend and i	china
sarah listen to me .	go away .
i ca n't believe she went out with that monster last night	forget her mark , she 's a bitch
guys , if i 'm going to play the hero at least give me a little room .	safety in numbers man .
anyone else not coming ?	right behind you .
this time i really do n't see anyone man .	must be what we came for . the four stand slowly and enter through the doors , which close behind them . they begin walking around the waxworks , which appear gruesome . the first they spy is of a high school student with a letter jacket on the verge of being hacked with an axe by and angry woodsman . they give each other looks of disgust and continue on . the next is of a frankenstein-esque creature carrying a woman in its arms . the four are now roaming around the waxworks individually , with tony encountering what appears to be a tribal indian pointing a knife towards a victim . mark walks past a circus cart with some sort of werebeast inside , and then continues on to a staircase exhibit with a dead woman at the base of it . on the staircase is a zombie-fied creature . we see china walking on the other side of a bandage wrapped man pumping gasoline into a woman 's mouth . finally , we see tony walking up to a cottage room display .
sir wilfred , this is sarah brighton . this is sir wilfred .	hi there sarah
no thank you sir we 're fine .	so mark , what 's so urgent ?
well ?	well divide 18 into three
if you sold your soul to the devil , you 'd never age either	sell my soul ?
any student of black magic can do it . .most of these books will tell you how ! sarah so what happens when you 've sold out ?	you get yourself a regular job , as satan 's disciple .
can this be stopped ?	maybe before the event , never after .
darling ? i hear you were having drinks with the butler the other night . now you know that sort of thing leads to anarchy .	mom .
one has to keep the distance between `them ' and `us '	they 're all human beings

do you have a scarf ?	hey .
yes ?	it 's only two hours away .
i know that .	i 'll come back all the time .
of course you will .	i 'm just saying , you 're going to be fine .
that was very good .	mom , i 'm sorry . i wanted to tell you . but it never felt right .
besides , dad would have freaked .	no , he would n't .
i think playing in a band called `` bitch '' might put a dent in the whole `` perfect family '' thing .	that 's not true .
he loves you very much . he just --	i know he does .
are you mad at me ?	listen to me . the one thing in life that i definitely do n't regret ... is the choice . i made to be your mother .
i miss you .	so much .
it got so bad your father almost had to put me away .	what do you mean ?
i started seeing things .	a ghost ?
did you ?	no . but once i heard ...
what ?	someone crying . a girl . i thought i was crazy .
who 's idea was it ?	mine . his . we both ... thought ...
i did n't want to come .	then why did you ?
because he was worried about me .	your husband ?
yes . i 'm sure he 's hoping you 'll pack me full of prozac so he can live out his life in peace .	do you really think so ?
why is he worried ?	because , i do n't know , because sometimes ... sometimes i forget things ... and ever since caitlin left , ever since my daughter left for school , there 've been ... i fainted and ... why is this so hard ?
fireball ?	you 're joking .
these are good .	mm-hmm .

what ?	try to communicate with her somehow .
you think that 'll help ?	ca n't hurt . and i think it 's important you find out what she wants .
are you humoring me ?	nope .
how ?	i do n't know . my aunt used to use my uncle 's old pajamas and a candle .
what 's happening to me ?	well , that 's what we 're here for .
whether you imagined it or not , you actually saw and heard things that frightened you ... that gave you reason for concern .	yes , but ...
your friend saw them .	is n't there something called group hysteria ?
you think you influenced her ?	maybe . i do n't know . i just know that when all this was happening , i felt , some part of me felt ... alive . like somebody needed me . and the more i reached out to , it , the fuller it became .
you 're saying you willed these events to happen ?	i do n't know , i 'm very confused right now .
she said , `` you know . '' that i know .	do you ?
no .	what do you think ? guess .
i felt ... pain . that she 'd been hurt by someone . this is great . i 'm trying to intuit the emotions of a figment of my --	have you been hurt ?
me ? no . well , in the accident i was injured , but ...	you were in an accident ?
what ?	that he does n't ... see me , or , you know , that i 'm ... that 's something 's wrong ... with me .
that ca n't feel good .	no , it does n't ... okay , look , i see what you 're doing here , and that 's , i 'm sorry , but that 's not it . my marriage is fine . i 've had some kind of `` empty-nest '' episode where i saw some things that were n't there . let 's deal with that . i 'm willing to deal with that . i just do n't want to go conjuring problems where none exist .
of course . you must be so proud .	i am .
how 're you holding up ?	just fine . it 's a lovely party .
norman was telling me the dream house is finally finished .	almost .

for the dupont chair . i swear . i 'm becoming the nosy old lady i used to run from at amherst .	no . i 'm just not sure what you mean .
there was just ... some tension . you were upset . i remember being concerned .	at the party .
toward the end . you remember ?	ohhh yes . no , no . just a little , you know ... we 're fine .

would you like some iced tea ?	very much .
your house is so beautiful .	thank you .
no .	of what ? what were you so afraid of ?
love .	what ?
have you ever felt so completely consumed by a feeling for someone that you could n't breathe ? that the time together is so passionate and consuming that you felt physical pain when they would leave ?	um ... sure .
you must think i 'm pathetic .	no . no , i do n't .
mrs. frank ?	yeah .
i 'd like to talk to you about madison .	you know where she is ?
no , i do n't .	please leave me alone .
what 's your name ?	claire .
just plain old coffee . none of that mocha nonsense .	it 's fine .
you look a little old for a student .	i 'm not . we ... we met at a party .
sounds about right . never understood how a girl that wild got all a 's . sure did n't get it from me . they wanted to put her in a special school for the gifted when she was young . maddie would n't hear about it .	she never mentioned her father .
why are you here ?	i do n't know .
full scholarships . princeton too . she wanted to stay close .	you must have been very proud .
they 're calling me in to work .	i should be going anyway .
y'hear anything you 'll let me know ?	of course .
what was her major ?	biology . she wanted to be a doctor .
wow .	this is ...
he looked like one of the monkees .	anyway , claire slept with him ...
i did n't sleep with him .	... just so she could cut them off .
he was so pissed .	i came in from my room ...
we were suite mates .	and there 's this brilliant conductor in purple briefs with no bangs cursing his ass off in finnish .
you should have heard her play .	stop .
we both auditioned for the philharmonic . one cello position open .	do we have to ?
and i kicked ass . my best stuff . then i stood in the hallway and listened to her audition ... and i cried .	she 's making this up .
she got it . turned it down .	i met a dashing young grad student after a recital one night ...
how you holding up ?	good . i 'm good .
you are ?	why does everyone find that so surprising ?
cause ... your ... only daughter just went away to school ... who you were incredibly close with aaand i 'd be tripping ...	okay , i 'm a little tender .
well good . so you 're human .	and so far my day has consisted of taking pictures of my roses for the garden club .
what is it ?	kambucha mushroom tea ...
jody --	it soothes heart-ache and promotes psychic wellness . sela suggested i bring --
you 're discussing me with your psychic ?	she 's not a psychic . just a very enlightened spirit .

oh my god . you bought it .	yep .
it 's niiice .	beautiful thing , alimony . lose a husband , get a car . think it 'll help me pick up dudes ?

you think he killed her ?	i do n't know . when you say it , it sounds crazy . but what else could it all be ?
know what i think ?	what ?
seance .	jody , no ...
telling you ...	... no ... no ... no ...
just bought this beautiful antique ouija .	please . that 's all i need .
someone 's there .	what ?
in the window . norman 's at work .	i do n't ...
wow . i 'm losing it .	no , you 're not . but a presence in your house is not something to be taken lightly .
sit down here .	are we hoping the ghost is going to have to pee ?
place your fingers on the planchette .	the planchette ?
we wish to commune with the spirit of mrs. feur . what 's her first name ?	i do n't know .

oh ...	m-e ...
mef ? what 's mef ?	it 's initials . f is feur . it 's her .
i have to go .	jody , wait .
are you okay ?	i think so
i 'm sorry for leaving , but i mean , jesus , claire ...	it 's alright .
does norman know ?	jody , she 's alive .
what ?	mrs. feur . she 's alive . i met her . she 's really sweet .
then what was it ?	nothing . it was n't anything . i 've been on edge lately . maybe since the accident . and i 'd prefer , i really would , to just --
something was there . you saw it .	did i ?
yes . now i talked to sela and there 's a guy , this pakistani guy down in hartford ...	hartford ?
and he 's the real thing . specializes in cases like this , like yours .	no . jody , listen to me . you have to listen to me . this is not something that i can do right now . whatever it was , it 's gone . i need it to be gone now .
but claire --	please .
okay . okay .	i 've got to find a bathroom . i 'll call you .
oh god ... you knew .	i was down in adamant ...
adamant ?	artsy little village down seven . there 's a guy there who sells my work . i had just dropped off some paintings and as i got in my car ... i saw norman sitting at this little cafe .
i started to walk over ... but he was n't alone . a blond . i only caught a glimpse . she was young . i should have said something right away . but i did n't .	why ?
partly because i did n't want to hurt you ... but partly ... partly because i was relieved .	relieved ?
by the time i finally got up the nerve to tell you , stan called from the hospital and it was too late .	too late ? jody , it was an accident .
i got there first . stan covered up the pills and i had it out with norman . he seemed desperate not to lose you . he promised to handle it . and we all let it drop away .	all of us .
i 'm a terrible friend .	no .
how could i expect you to tell me something that i would n't even tell myself ?	what are you going to do ?
i do n't know .	if she was dangerous before --
she could have hurt me if she wanted to .	you do n't know that . if it 's your belief that gives her form , then you 've got to shut her out . somehow you have to break the connection .
jody , she tried to kill him .	i know .
i ca n't believe this is happening .	we need help . please let me call the medium .
alight , alright . stay calm . you opened this door . there 's got to be a way that you can close it .	like what ?
i have an idea . but , i mean , i 'm just making this up ...	what is it ?
but he acted like he 'd never heard of it .	did he say that ?
jody he was lying .	what if he was ? do you think he wanted to bring that up again just when you 're trying to make a new start ?
i guess not .	he 's trying to put it behind him , claire . you should too .
you 've got a beautiful life . and even with this , it 's always been clear that he loves you . i 've come to think that 's all that really matters .	i do n't know ...
christ , that 's twice in ... when did they move in ?	i think three ...
what 's their name ?	feur , i think . psych department . figures . they 're all psychotic .
she 's awake .	we 'll be quiet . quick and quiet .

it 's just she 's been the focus for a while .	not the focus .

i 'm finished at three . no . squash with stan .	after that .
of what ?	of him i think .
did she say that ?	more or less .
honey , they 're young . they 're probably newlyweds .	i 'm telling you . there was something in her voice ...
remember how we were ?	not like this . we were never like this . i want to go over there . after dinner , we can --
why ?	to make sure she 's all right .
claire , honey , we are not going to march next door and accuse our new neighbor of --	that 's not what i 'm sug --
... when tonight they 'll probably be keeping us awake .	but what if something happens ?
claire ...	i 'd never be able to live with mysel --
nothing 's going to happen . besides , i have to work tonight . the conference is in less than two weeks . i 've got to stay focused on that for just a little longer . this is ...	i know .
i just wish you could have heard her .	look , i 'll call harvey tomes in the psych department , see what i can find out .
norman , you have to look at this !	mmnph .
nothing . there was ... i thought i saw something .	is it gone ?
hi .	i 'm stuck here for another couple of hours .
oh .	unless you need me to come home ...
claire ?	huh ? absolutely . take your time .
what are you doing here ?	there were some noises . i did n't want to disturb you .
what do you mean ? some noises where ?	in the house . i was scared .
did you call the police ?	no . can you drive me home ? i 'll bring you back in the morning .
it was there . this angry music all by itself . and i heard whispering .	what kind of whispering ?
i 've got the conference next week . i want you to feel safe .	i do , i do . i 'm sure i 'm just ... how was your day ?
think i may have cracked it .	really ?
i think so . maybe .	you are so brilliant .
yep .	madame curie , jonas salk , norman spencer ...
ohmigod . you 'll never believe ... i saw schumway ...	you 're kidding .
he 's here giving some arcane spiel for the physics department , so bob shine introduces us ...	wow .
and he says ... you 'll fucking love this , he says , `` doctor spencer , i am a great admirer of your work ... ''	well , that 's nice .
`` ... especially spencer 's theorem ... ''	oh , no ...
`` ... of perpetual distances . '' everybody 's checking their shoelaces . pins drop . `` i 'm afraid you 've mistaken me , '' i say ...	that 's ...
`` ... for my father . ''	i 'm so sorry .
did n't know he was dead , every stinking paper on the globe .	that 's just mean . oh . jody wanted to know if i could get her some .
did you tell her ?	what ? no . no .
you did n't ?	norman , you are so funny about that . no , i did n't .
sorry . you understand .	did you call about the feurs ?
oh , right . yes . harvey says the guy 's a sweetheart . would n't hurt a fly .	huh .
get down ! he 'll see .	what 's going on , claire ?
he killed her .	what ?
he did . she 's in the picture . i went over to look and she 's gone . the table was set for one .	and that means he murdered his wife ? this is getting ridic --
our house .	no . look ! in the window .
it 's a flare .	a flare ?
from the sun . it 's a reflection on the glass .	it 's her ! i 'm telling you . she whispered and turned on the music . she 's trying to contact me !
where is she then ?	she could be out . she could be sick in bed for all we know .
see ?	what am i looking at ?
i did n't do that .	who did ? mrs. feur ?
maybe . point is ... not me .	right . and why is she here ? if he killed her , why does n't she haunt him ?
she was lonely , i talked to her . norman , i know how it looks , but --	claire , listen to me . i know you 're under some strain . but there 's no such thing as ghosts . they do n't exist . our neighbor did not kill his wife , and i ... wait , why are n't you dressed ?
dressed ?	dinner . with stan and his new girl .
when ?	what do you mean ? claire , we talked about it . you did n't want japanese , i said , our first date since ...
oh .	... since caitlin . you do n't remember this ?
tonight ?	yes , tonight . we 're going to be --
when you do this , i swear ...	... do n't get all ...
... like it never even happened ...	okay , okay , i 'm sure that i just ...
what are you doing ?	restaurant . let them know we 're running late .
you 're not at the center .	i know i 'm not at the center of the bridge .
there we go .	well , that 's a relief .
i do n't need a shrink .	harvey says he 's amazing .
norman ...	what can it hurt to talk to someone ?
claire , she 's been a huge part of your life for seventeen years . if you were n't thrown off balance by this , then something would be wrong .	i never said i was n't upset . of course i 'm upset . i miss her terribly . but i know what i saw and what i heard ... and it was n't some `` symptom '' of something ...
i never said ...	... and i do n't think i 'm some lonely , middle-aged woman cracking up .
are you lonely ?	no ! and i do n't need a psychiatrist !
what are you doing out here ?	he killed her . i 'm not crazy . he killed her and --
this is the feur thing ?	yes . and he 's going to get away with it .
how do you know this ?	we had a seance .
who did ?	jody and i. and she was there , norman , she was . it scared jody so bad she had to leave .
how did you --	jody brought a ouija board and we summoned her .
what ?	maybe you resent how busy i 've been .
what are you ... ? no .	you know what i 've got at stake with this paper . you know that . i ca n't help but think that you 're doing this now to hurt me , or to sabotage me somehow .
sabotage ?	ever since the accident i 've been worried that you 'd been unhappy , or ...
the accident ... ?	but then you 've been so much better ...
norman , this is n't about you . this is something that 's happening to me . it 's not to get even ... and it 's not some warped bid for attention . some strange things are happening in our house , whether you believe in them or not ...	sweetheart --
keep your voice down .	i will not .
maybe you 're right . maybe i 'm losing my mind ...	claire , please ...
i 'm sorry ...	then where is she ?
... i 'm pulling up , yuri . i 'll see you for dinner . sure you wo n't stay ?	no , it 's fine . i 'm fine .
do i have everything ?	yep .
what ?	are you glad ? i 'm glad .
you know i am .	good . you sat in front ... i saw you there ...
you were lost in the music ... eyes closed ... your chest heaving ...	i felt you ... looking through me ...
we walked all night ...	you told me that i was ...
you do n't remember ?	when she said it , there was something familiar ... but no .
you dropped a glass .	i ...
a cheap wine glass from the caterers . you started crying . i tried to comfort you ...	in the living room ...
you shoved me away and ran out to the patio . i took you home .	but why ? i ca n't understand how i could just completely --
it was maybe a week after the accident . we were moving . it was a hard time .	but i do n't remember .
sweetheart , it was over a year ago .	what 's wrong with me ?
i may have seen her on campus .	not personally .
no . i 'm afraid to ask what this is about .	it 's her . this is the woman who i 've seen .
the ...	yes . the ghost .
i thought it was mrs. feur , but it 's not ...	stop ...
... i 'm positive this time ...	... please stop ...
it 's madison fra --	stop it !
i take it your not mad at me .	would n't go that far .
ow !	what 's the matter ?
it 's too rough .	since when ?
i do n't like this , this ...	why do n't you shut up and fuck me , professor .
i think she 's starting to suspect something .	who ?
your wife ...	stop it !
`` you know ... ''	what ?
i was there .	claire --
i came to work in the garden and i saw you with her ... in my house .	oh god ...
it was last year . we were having troubles .	so you fucked a student ? !
that 's not what i 'm sayi --	do n't touch me . just get away from me . go !
claire , please do n't ...	what did you think i would do ? jesus christ ! i gave up my life and my music ...
i never asked you to quit !	... oh bullshit . you had to topple perfect daddy and that meant perfect wife , perfect family ...
that 's not true ! you wanted to quit ! and then when you did , you hated me for it ... so you gave it all to her .	who ?
leave her out of this !	and then out of nowhere , some bright young woman found me attractive ...
stop ...	... would do anything just to be around me . and i slipped . god help me , i slipped .
i tried to break it off !	you should have tried harder .
claire ...	get out of my way .
she was damaged and unstable . the more i tried to distance myself , the more desperate she became . finally , she showed up at the new house ...	how did she know where it was ?
she did it .	we do n't know that for sure .
we have to get out of here .	it 's alright .
ca n't you see , she 's trying to kill us .	she 's gone .
what ?	she ca n't be here without me .
how can you be sure ?	i do n't know , but i am . she was there and then she was gone . i felt it .
the leaves ...	incredible . we should take a drive before they 're gone . spend the night at some cozy little bed and breakfast .
look for antiques ...	yep . there 's some great places nearby .
adamant .	what ?
little village down seven . supposed to be charming .	huh .
do you know it ?	do n't think so .
what 's that for ?	nothing .
i 'm cooking you dinner .	you do n't have to do that .
i know .	fine . i 'll do the shopping .
she 's out there is n't she ? she 's in the lake .	okay . do n't ... you do n't understand what this is .
do n't i , norman ? you kept the fucking necklace . of a woman you killed !	i did not ! i did not kill anyone . jesus . claire , listen to me . i walked in and she was lying there dead . i swear to you . on my life ! she took pills and she killed herself in our house to destroy me ! to destroy us ! if i had n't stopped by here before school , the painters would have --
i do n't believe you .	it 's true . that 's ... you have to believe me ! oh god , i 'm telling you the truth ! i did what i had to , claire . she was gone . there was nothing i could do for her . i did ... i put her in the lake . i rolled the car in ... and i watched it sink . and i 've lived with that image ever since . i could n't just stand there while everything -- my career , us , everything , just washed away . do n't you see , claire ? she 's doing this ! this is exactly what she wants you to think !
mmmuh ...	shhhh .
what ?	madison !
: what , you 're doing darcy ? since when ?	: no , i said , i hate what i 'm doing to darcy . oh , boy , men are stupider , it 's true .
: would you stop it !	: well , they are .
: what do you mean `` they '' are ? are you officially a woman now ?	: oh , i wish . a woman would n't have screwed over the woman she loved . no , they do n't think that way .
many times over the past thirty years . why he shows himself to me , i do n't know but lasher 's not some mindless wraith .	then what is he ... ?
going away does n't mean you leave lasher behind . he was on rowan 's deck - and the plane ... geography seems irrelevant now .	michael - you loved that house as a child . you could work again ! you could make it ours . we 'll sweep out the horror . and lasher with it !
thank you for this honor , my dear .	you 've been shadowing the family for thirty years . it 's only fitting you give one af us away .
i have seen him again . last night .	but you 've not told michael .
lasher will act , rowan . whatever it is he wants - he 's waited three hundred years to have it . facing him alone ... i do n't like -	lasher is my legacy - not michael 's . aaron , i 've seen the pain in michael . i ca n't bear to see anymore . he 's not to know . swear to me .
are you alright ... ? you look pale .	i wish everyone would stop commenting on my health . i 'm the doctor .
there are two .	two what ... ?
with his hands !	but why would they do that ... ?
you 've always said you felt goodness in them - that the witches brought you and rowan together . is n't that right ... ? they 're reaching out to you , rowan !	but it does n't make sense . they - they used lasher ... they conspired with him .
jesus i 've got - to get to the ho --	rowan 's already called the hotel , michael . at the cemetery by now , i would guess .
how do you know about rowan ... ? i did n't -- - cemetery ... ?	with her family . rowan 's mother died yesterday .
i ask only that you stay here , long enough to be - educated . a few hours .	you sound certifiable . yon know that .
i - r saw him as a child . lots of times ... but no one else did .	come . there is a lot to read
a what ... ?	a spirit . perhaps evil ... ... and he has come to you- with diedre gone - you 've ... inherited him .
no scaredy-cats in the talamasca , huh ... ?	there is a difference between sensing danger - and being afraid . what defines you in the landscape , michael ... ? what anchors your life ... ? your work ... ? your creativity ... ?
rowan .	then focus on how you feel about her . because your feelings define you . take off your gloves , michael .
do n't tell rowan about this .	michael , rowan should -
what have the witches always asked of you ... ?	`` go back , michael . do what you can ... ''
o n't know what else to do . maybe i just do n't belong in her life . well - i 'm already out of her life .	nothing was ever more false .
i 'll probably be back in a week ... but i ca n't spend christmas in that house . you 'll check on her - every day ... ?	every day twice .
aaron - lieten to me ... it 's been lasher - from the start !	what are you talk -- -
rowan ...	you have to warn her - this second ! i 'm catching the next flight back !

there is no one here but the dead .	go away ! i do n't want you here .
if that were true , i would not be here .	it 's very dangerous to assume you know what a woman wants .
a girl ... ?	it 's too soon to know .
you crave what i might show you . what you can learn . what i can give you . so much more than michael can .	what michael gives me is stronger than anything you could ever inderstand .
but i could understand . i want to understand !	i love him !
do not tell me that !	i love michael . michael ! !

and now you expect me to stockpile corpses for you ... ? !	no , my love . i want nothing more of the dead . i want you to -- - chang me .
i 've waited for you - the one whose science could match her powers ... do you know what it 's like - to sense the majesty of something so sublime just beyond your reach ... ? to float in a dream that keeps a .promise half-hidden in its shadows.-. ? i did not choose to be such as this ! suzanne brought me here . she called to me !	but have i ... ? ever ... ? !
-- - and i have heard you from the beginning ... from it 's very first beat .	i love michael ...
you must n't hurt him . must n't - must n't hurt..	focus all your powers on me , rowan until it is done . only me ...
only you ...	change me , rowan , and we can change everything ...
go on . rowan . go on .	leave me alone !
what is wrong ... ?	wrong ... ? science is not magic .
i do not understand ...	you went into the cells -- - and you changed them . how ... ? !
there was no thought . there was no act . that is not what i am .	i do n't know what you are ! ! !
no !	tell me what i am , rowan .
aaron was in the dream . a dream tilled with spirits . you killed him , did n't you ... ?	it was an accident . gifford , too .
the portraits , lasher . why are the witches always before a door ... ? tell me , lasher . now !	they want to come back . we have a pact - of mutual desire and consent . the mayfairs ar . a beautiful tapestry . i have weaved you all together - from the start . i brought petyr van abel to suzanne . he had genius in him . scientific , precise . it was a perfect start . and on it has gone - father to mother ... sister to brother ... father to daughter ...
oh god ...	ju1ien was your father your great-grandfather - your grandfather - and your father . all one in the same ... that is why he fought carlotta for your life .
rowan and i will be together now . my time has come . your time is gone .	no ! do n't ! lasher ! ! !

i 'll destroy you . i swear it ! if you do n't kill me , i 'll find a -	'kill you ... ? ' you are my mother . do you think i would hurt you ... ?
i am your son . i would not wound you . i could not - ever .	i know . you are my son -
harder ...	rowan ...
harder ...	like this ... like this ... ?
yessss ...	always loved you . rowan . always ...
they like you -- -- -- - kids .	i guess so . the trick is remembering how to act like one . i 'm glad you called , mr. curry . i wanted to see you . why do n't we go to my office ...
i 've read the stories - and seen the news coverage .	'freak at the week . ' that 's what the tv crew . call it- people come right to the house . they have a husband or wife who skipped town - or a missing kid- they bring a sweater or a toy - and ask me to touch it . so i can teel them where they are..
i do n't remember you at all- you - you saved my life- bizarre thing to say , is n't it ... ?	i 'm glad you 're around to say it .
my jury 's still out on that ,	then call it in . mr. curry . whatever 's happeninq to you - death is not the preferable alternative . i 'm in the life business - remember.. ?
do they keep everything 'out ' ... ?	as far as touching things , yes . but the vision - that keeps pouring into my head- it wo n't go away god - if i could just understand it .
what do you see ... ?	nothing . absolutely nothing-
just one . the bar 's closed .	the one time i want it to work ...
you know - doors and keyholes are common signposts in out-of-body -	you 're not gon na give me the textbook analysia , are you doctor ... ? my vision was just the chemical reaction of an oxygen-starved brain - and nobody -
harder ...	rowan ...
harder !	like this ... ? like this ... ? !
you 're very -- - different .	i 'll bet you say that to all the women who bring you back to life and then seduce you .
what else did you see- michael ... ?	what 're you - a mindreader ... ? who was the man on the kitchen floor . ~ . ?
my uncle . graham . he and my aunt , ellie raised me . he - he - had a stroke- just before ellie died - of cancer . last year .	you knelt there , helpless- you could n't save him . there was so such anger in you- . death infuriates you ...
it 's unbelievable that you can do that .	it - it feels like - like i 'm being filled up . crowded out of myself . like i 'm fading away-
my mother and i used to take long walks and make up stories about the houses and the people who lived inside . the queen 's house- . the gangster 's house- . the clown 's house- like that .	and whose houses do you design ... ?
oh . the green underwater ghost 's ... the man with the eyes in his hands ...	you still feel that crazy ... ?
i was born , in new orleans , too-	really ... ? your family there ... ?
too much ... too fast ... ?	mm-hmm . scared- i feel a little like the moth and the flame .
he 's very pleased with your response to the surroundings .	he fools around with his patients too .
you touched him -- - and saw him ... ? what was he doinging . kinky ... ?	it 's come to that , huh ... ? three weeks - and you need a psychic skin flick to perk up our sex life ... ?
you look very deep when you do that . it 's interesting . we 're complete opposites- i 'd never just sit and wait for insparation . i 'd skip my turn and swap some letters .	ms. yin , and mr. yang aha !
y-u-h-e-e-y-a-h. yu-hee-yah ... ? no way , busters use it in a sentence .	okay . y'all make sure and come back now , reeeeal soon - yu'heeyah .
why do n't you let at do that ... ?	just sit there and soak up the vitamin d .
doctor 's orders- - - ?	captain 's orders .
far from it , michael ... do n't put me up there .	all i meant was -
christ , michael - what the hell are we doing ... ? we do n't even know -	is this the part where you try and talk yourself out of how good this is ... ?
i 'm serious . you do n't -	let 's see ... next you tell me all the terrible things about you - and prove that we 're doomed to fail - right ... ? you hate kittens and puppies , you 've drivin all your lovers to suicide -- and those mysterious deaths at the hospital were really -
stop it .	you stop it . you 're loving , and gentel.. you 're the most remarkable woman i 've ever met -- - so stop telling me i do n't know what i feel just cause you 're scared . cause it wo n't work .
seems more like a year than a month .	michael - this place is increadible . you - you 're brilliant ... the things you created ...
i called dr. styles at the neurological institute in l.a. , remember ... ? he said he 'd see you . he was intrigned .	god knows , i 'm intriguing .
michael , do you want to wear those for the rest of your life ... ?	
we 're quite a pair , you and i .	mad . for each other .
hello ... ?	michael ! jesus i 've been trying -
rowan ... ?	listen . last night - oh christ , this'1l take forever to explain . god , michael ...
michael - i have to go - to new orleans . i 'll - i 'll call yati when i -	what about you coming down here ... ?
go to lax and get on a flight to new orleans . go to the ponchartrain hotel and wait for me . i 'll call you there .	wait a minute . rowan - what is going on ... ?
you know ... ?	i know . it 's not possible -- - but i know .
she - she said i - i was a -- -	- a witch .
it could 've been a tornado - or a - a hurricane . maybe -	michael - i saw him ! twice ! carlotta said i -- - killed graham - with - with my anger .
ro - you ca n't really believe that . nobody can murder someone with their feelings . i mean -- - that 's crazy .	is it more or less crazy than dying and coming back to life with hands that can see ... ? god , michael -- - what am i ... ?
c'mon . let 's go to the ho -- -	he 's in there ! or are you out for a stroll in the garden ... ? ! where are you , goddamnit ... ? !
even if it 's all true - that does n't make you a witch ! it 's 1992 , rowan !	but it scares the hell out of you , does n't it . michael ... ?
stop looking at me like that ! i 'm not some siren chanting to the moon . and my life is not a cosmic whim ! i am in charge of my life - - and i want to stay . everything that was taken from me is here , michael . all these years , she was there without me . helpless . i should have been here .	rowan ... think of what 's in that book . think of last night !
do you love me , michael ... ?	yes . i love you . very much .
it 'd take mounths ... and cost a fortune .	i 'm soon to be a very wealthy witch .
what about your work back home ... ?	they need doctors in new orleans too . michael - think what i could do with the money !
i 'll bet she had a wonderful smile .	let 's see .
you sure ... ?	it 's the next best thing to being there ' - right ... ?
everyone - this is michael curry .	hello..
i 'm wondering why the hell he has n't shown up .	he ca n't hurt us , michael . it 's us - our love . he ca n't find a crack in it . he ca n't find a way in .
maybe he 's just - waiting ...	if we married , we 'd shut him out forever .
ro , how long have we known each other .	i do n't think of us that way - ever .
either do i. i love you , ro . you know that . you 're a total mystery to me - but i love you .	than letts get rnarried , michael . i could put a spell on you - and make you say yes .
you 're a ve-ry bad witch , you know that ... ?	no , i 'm ve-ry good -- - and you aught to know .
smoking is bad for your heart , michael .	hey - i 'm getting married in the morning - i already gave up drinking . one crutch at a time , doctor .
you 're just afraid i 'll drop dead before i finish the damn house .	and i thought i was the mindreader .
i took off my gloves today - with aaron - - and it was okay .	that 's great !
are n't we supposed to love somebody for their moral rectitude or their courage or their beneficence -	their what ... ?

it 's not some fairytale in an old book . michael - look at me . i did n't choose this , michael . this is who i am . i love you .	i love you too .
fall in new orleans ... this whole town is waterlogged ! the matches , the wood , my clothes , my skin .	that 's cause we 're below sea level .
rowan we 're below sea level . i 've spent time there myself .	that 's not funny .

go home , stu i 'll call you .	bullshit ! let me in ! mikey - there are people who can help figure this ont .
on which planet ... ?	you ca n't just -
well , normie - you wo n't have to worry about this one being finished for a lonnnnng time . how are the hands ... ?	the guy i told you about - aaron ... ? he says i can learn to control them . that i could lose the gloves at some point .

mikey - pregnant women get crazy you know that . i mean - hell , they 're all crazy anyway - right ... ?	comes running out the front door - down the walk to them . michael seems to pull inside himself . cool . aloof .
we 'd better get to work on the papers .	papers ... ?
standard for a mayfair marriage . rowan - there is a codicil concerning the mayfair assets . they must be ... aahhh ... held separate from the other party ... michael that is it 's in the will - for centuries . tradition enjoins , rowan . of course , future earnings from your practice will not fall into -	i 've decided not to open a practice here i want to set up a research clinic . for infant genetic disorder .
that 's new territory for us ... but yes , we can look into that . explore shelter possibilities , funding bodies . we could -	no tax shelters . no funding . i want to fund the clinic - exclusively . the diedre mayfair research clinic . i 'd like to find an existing building and move in immediately - while we draw up plans for new construction .
that would mean liquidating sizable amounts of cash .	i plan on liquidating almost evetything .
which do you think is her best shot ...	the one on the left - definitely ...
i 've got a tenant coming over later - can i take the afternoon off ?	as long as you get the hacksaw piece done by friday ... friday ?
that 's not technically accurate - simpsons murders were n't sexually motivated .	you know that circulation is down for three months in a row .
i heard something like that	then it 's going to be 'i killed for sex ' ... listen darling , why wo n't you let us use your real name for the features - if people knew that it was the ellen carter writing the features and not just some pseudonym - then we might shift more units . you have n't written anything in four years darling - i know you need this job - and if circulation keeps dropping , there 's not going to be a magazine for you to write for ...
oh my gawd !	i 'm sorry - i did n't think
i thought you were someone else	well i 'm glad i 'm not them - what are you doing here so late ? come to that , what the hell have you got that for ?
i thought someone was following me - i - er - i just needed my computer and some things ... listen , i 'd like to work from home for a few weeks - is that ok ?	why do n't you take a few weeks off - you 're due some holiday time .
sounds good - thank you	do n't mention it - now can i get back to my accounts , or do you want to fillet me ?
you see , i am writing this article for chic magazine	chic magazine ?
when could i look round ?	well , if you could come sometime just before we close , then i could show you everything and then we could go for a drink to discuss the finer points ...
that 's very kind of you mr griffiths ... ?	brian ...
its cramped in here is n't it brian	yes it is ...
tell me brian , what would happen if the client lost the key ?	then we would have to call in our locksmith to break the lock
so there is only one key ...	that 's right ...
and it ca n't be forged ?	i did n't say that - i 'm sure it could be , but our clients must sign in first , checking signatures , and a photo ident - we had a nasty theft two years ago and we 've been very strict since then .
yes , i 'm sure you could - but i ca n't risk you loosing your job	no -it 's no problem - i do it all the time
all the time ?	no - not all the time - i mean
hello mrs steckler - we have n't seen you for a long time	no - i 've been abroad for a long time ...
i should n't say this - but you really remind me of someone i know	oh really - you must remember me from when i was a regular customer .
i was n't a manager here then mrs steckler - do n't you remember ?	i 'm terribly sorry - i have a bad memory ...
this must be one of the old keys -	yes - i have had it for years .
it does n't mention 'females only '	i really do n't know what to say
oh - tell me ellen , i can call you ellen ?	sure ...
i lost the touch	the touch ?
do you take sugar ?	yes , two please . i 'm sorry , i did n't mean to pry , it 's just that i really loved your book
what are you doing ?	i 'm sorry ?
what 's with all the locks - and hammering	it says in the contract i can have a lock fitted - is there a problem angela ?
my names is n't angela ...	yes - i 'm sorry ellen ...
if you want any - there 's some left in the kitchen	i think i will pass ...
sugar ?	yes , one and a half please .
so what do you do ?	i 'm a dentist
oh , about six years since i graduated	and how many people have you killed ?
i do n't know	you do n't know ?
no - the police say i 've killed fourteen - but i 've not - i 've killed many more . it amazes me how they just have n't found the bodies . what is society coming to when people just do n't get missed . i agree , some of them are well hidden - i probably could n't even show you where i put them - one girl , number eight i think the press called it - she was n't even mine - i do n't know who did it but i did n't	where do you kill them ...
oh anywhere - whenever i needed to - do you know how easy it is to take them ? you just pick up a hiker , or someone off the streets - they believe so easily you know , 'look , i have something to show you ' i would say - and that would be it . one girl , i think her name is debbie - she had broken down on the motorway , and i offered to take her to a service station to call for a tow truck - she just got in and i drove away . when i pulled into the layby and took out my knife - she just froze , and said - what do you want ? - i said , you know what i want . - but she did n't . getting rid of the bodies is just as easy - the first i cut up , put in bags with bricks in , and tossed them off eldridge bridge in broad daylight . the real problem with my work is the blood - there is so much of it - and it all spurts out so fast - like a fountain . it made such a mess of	my car i stopped working from my car . she could have stopped me you know - if she really wanted too . that is the difference between the confusion of humanity and the purity of the beast - if a dog attacked you - you could easily kill it without any damage to yourself - why then do people get bitten by dogs - savaged ? why ?
i do n't know	because a dog will attack with a ferocity and force that we poses , but centuries of social contamination has run it out of us - that is what sets us aside from the purity of the beasts ... society is rotting - men who once were strong and kept everything working are getting soft - women are making them soft - by the time a pretty girl has reached twenty - she has had three lifetimes worth of fun and attention- so she does n't deserve any more -
did n't debbie deserve anymore ?	no she did n't ...
what did you do with her ?	you know everyone accuses me of being sick - the press , the tv - but i 'm not you know - they are - i do n't watch it for entertainment every night - i do n't sit and watch it whilst eating my dinner - they all say , how could he cut her up ? she was dead - i ca n't hurt something dead - and all this whilst they slobber down their processed beef burgers by the dozen - i could n't eat one of those burgers , you do n't know what has gone in them !
the press think that the white angel is a woman - why is that ? do you dress up leslie ?	i do n't want to talk about it -
ok , the press call you the white angle because you only kill girls wearing white - why white - white clothes , blonde hair ...	i do n't know ...
is 'their ' colour an expression of their inner self ? by that i mean , extroverts wear bright colours - so what are people who wear white ?	i do n't know ...
is white an expression of innocence ? do you crave innocence leslie ?	let me ask you , why do you wear black ellen carter ? what are you running from ?
do you feel sorry for the girls you have killed	why should i feel sorry - they 're dead .
how long have you been watching me ?	i have something i have to show you ...
tell me about your wife ...	my wife my wife was the only one who really deserved it . leslie do this . leslie do that . leslie it 's your fault ... she used to tell me what to wear , where to go , what to do - she mothered me ...
then why did you marry her -	it seemed like a good idea at the time - why did you marry your husband .
what did n't you like about her ?	i hated being treated like a failure - looked down on - my sister used to do that - i hated it - i should have known , when we got married - in a registry office of course - she wore maroon - i just wanted a white wedding i think she thought i was a ticket to the good life . i had a good job , prospects . and she was a slut - i did n't know until too late . one day , i came
you are the first person i have ever told any of this to . we are birds of a feather ellen ... we 're in the same league	i do n't think so ... this is n't a game you know ... there are n't points or leagues . sure i killed my husband - but i am no killer .
you 've killed but you 're not a killer	that 's right ... do n't ever think that you and i are the same - we 're not even remotely similar . i did what i had to do for myself , for my own self preservation - not to live out some bizarre role playing fantasy . my husband was sick -
tell me how it happened ...	why should i ?
and how did it feel to be rid of him	wonderful - like a great release - he was a malignant cancer and i had to remove him - the world is better without him
my mother ... ? i never knew my real mother - i was adopted	tell me about your adopted mother
you think i killed my mother do n't you ?	did you ?
no ... i did n't do it ... i wish i had but i did n't . i was beaten to it . stephanie became my mother .	stephanie ?
my sister - my adopted sister -	did stephanie kill your mother ?
what was your relationship with stephanie ?	it was wrong - all my life i have been cheated - cheated of anything good - i should n't have been born - i was a mistake - my natural mother was a whore - that makes me ...
i want it to stop - it all to stop ...	then make it stop ...
what ?	i know this sounds insane ellen , but ... telling you all of this , writing the book ... it feels good . do n't get me wrong - i feel like a weight is being lifted from my shoulders ... when i tell you what i have done - i ca n't believe it is me ... yet i know it was . this is like a purging for me ...
psychiatrists would say that you are confronting your demons	demons ... this would n't have been possible without you ... you have given me incentive ellen - i can see clearer now ...
what 's wrong ?	nothing could be better ...
what 's wrong ?	i am ashamed of what i have done ellen . when i read what you had written it made me think - look into myself - i have n't dared look into myself for a long time - i have stopped ellen , i ca n't carry on - i wo n't carry on . all i want is to start a new life - i want a second chance ... you are good to me - you do n't condescend , you 're intelligent , and very beautiful ...
what is it ?	open it ...
yes ...	you want me to wear white for you ? you must be madder than i thought ...
but ellen , i told you i have stopped ...	but for how long - what will set you off again ? you 'll be walking down the street and some girl will be wearing a white hat - and that will be it - back on the merry go round ...
where are you going ?	out - i may be some time
we 've got nothing to talk about	leslie i 'm sorry - i - i did n't know what to think
i thought we had a relationship built on trust - and you just slap me in the face ...	i am sorry ...
leslie ? is that good enough ?	yes - i suppose so ...
ellen , would you like a cup - there 's plenty in the pot	no thanks -
first finish your tea ...	he does n't need to ...
why did you let him in ?	what was i supposed to do ?
i do n't like sugar	there is n't that much - you did n't even taste it - what 's wrong - do n't you like my tea ?
it 's not that - i just do n't want any sugar	why whats wrong with the sugar -
i have n't been using it recently leslie	crap ! - i wish i had taken a photo of your face when i gave some to that detective - what 's wrong ellen - you look pale - maybe you have been eating the wrong kind of foods lately - it could be food poisoning ?
whats wrong ... what have i done wrong ?	nothing leslie - i just think we should wait ...
i do n't want either of us to come to any harm - please ...	you killed my friend !
i loved you ellen - why did you do this ?	it 's what you would do to me
do n't you want me now leslie	no - i 'll have you after
i 'm sorry , i could n't - when is she due ?	at 2.00 ...
well , what do you think ?	i do n't know - it 's your house ellen
yes - but you live here too - if it were your house ?	i think he 's fine - i do n't know why you have this thing about men - it would be nice to have a guy in the house for a change - i do n't think he would hurt a fly .
what 's wrong with you ?	i would prefer it if you kept away from leslie
what ?	you heard me - keep away from him
you do n't own him you know - you ca n't tell me not to see him !	yes i can ...
i want you out now	leave ! ? who the hell do you think you are ?
what happened ?	i had an accident - i fell down stairs ...
is leslie here ?	no he had to - he 's just - he 's out ...
it 's been what , three years ?	what 's this all about ?
what brings the rats out of the sewers ?	i 'm here about the so called disappearance of your husband - it 's best if we let old bones lie . know what i mean ? i 'm working on the white angel case now - and i 've got to check all known murderers or suspected murderers for the last five years ... and that means you ... so where were you last thursday afternoon around five ...
it did give me a chance to meet you again ellen - it 's all routine you understand ... so where were you ?	at home alone - where were you ?
as it happens , i was at home alone - maybe we could solve each others problems ?	get out ...
i 'd watch her mate - she has thing for men - they disappear near her .	i think you had better leave
i 'm really very sorry - i was banking on this coming through , because it 's only five minutes from my surgery ...	surgery ? are you a doctor ?
just put it in my room	no worries
i 'm sorry , i did n't mean to shout ...	do n't worry about it -
you 're a novelist - why did n't you tell me ?	and not just any novelist - a great novelist - it was an impressive piece of work ellen ...
her husband left her	oh ...
i thought it was you - how are you ?	i 'm good - i was just making a delivery near here , so i thought i would see if you were about ...
that 's good	i 'd really like it if you would come round some time - then i could cook you a meal - what do you say ...
good - i 've got to dash - say that i said hello to ellen for me would you ...	yes - of course .
dr steckler ?	yes ... ?
dead ?	or was it , she wished he was dead - that 's it - i believe he left the country with another woman - all rather sordid .
so she did n't mention anything more about it ?	no - she is n't in any trouble is she ?
oh no sir - just making some enquiries ... just tell her that inspector taylor called on you - she 'll understand	i 'll be sure to ...
i should n't really - i 'm not your surgeon ...	who said anything about surgery ... it 'll only take a moment .
sugar ?	yes - one please .
angel ...	yes , sorry - he 's here to make sure that you are alright
come on , bro . spare yourself the humiliation , the degradation ...	you and your pep talks .
do n't get me wrong . we can salivate over all the christy malones of our lives . wishing we could devour them like melt-in-your-mouth filet mignon . but we 're strictly hamburger guys . ground chuck , sixty eight percent lean , is about the best we can hope for .	that 's charlie . my best friend . he 's into beef analogies , partly because he 's a butcher 's son , and partly because , well , he 's just into beef analogies . what can i say ? he 's also a photographer ...
i genuinely think she wants me . i feel a vibe .	that vibe is from your wrist , pal . you 've been over-tenderizing your meat , again .
see ? did you see that ?	she smiles at everyone , ted . she 's like a newborn with gas .
the only chick more untouchable than christy malone is miss april . `` hi , my name 's ginger . i love tofu burgers , rainy nights , and riding bareback . my biggest turn-off is cell phones during sex . '' here 's a tip : set it on vibrate , honey , and do n't be stingy with the lube . do n't knock it till you tried it .	were you always this sick ?
someday , i 'll find out .	you have a better chance of being hit by a mack truck with a refrigerated cargo bed full of sirloin tip .
i defy your hamburger theory of life , and all of the unfulfilled hopes and dreams it represents .	that 's crazy talk .
do n't do it , ted . do n't do it .	any time , any day , a man can completely reinvent himself .
think about it ... long tunnel , bright lights , it 's full of vaginal symbolism .	poor freud , turning in his grave .
seriously , it 's like we 're being reborn . we really could reinvent ourselves here , just like you said . nobody knows about your massive humiliation .	nobody knows about your mental retardation .
nobody knows you barfed during junior high school graduation .	nobody knows about your constant masturbation .
what are the odds of there being another ted nelson on our flight ?	astronomical .
who the hell was your father ?	well , dad said ...
... a bouncer ? are you serious ?	maybe he got promoted .
this is the life , baby . we get ourselves some tail and we 're talking spring break !	cut it out , before you break something !
do n't you know anything about limo etiquette ? everything in here is included for our pleasure .	wait a second , i thought we were hamburger guys .
i ca n't believe that 's your mother . we 're talking babe-a-licious chub fest , right here in the 501 's .	perv .
this is like my every wet dream come true . i do n't even care that you 're here , too , bro .	be cool . fake it if you have to .
i wonder how many of them will be at the orgy tonight ?	this is n't some 80 's porno film , you dip shit . there are no wild sex orgies .
oh . well . maybe not yet .	not ever . never .
you kiss your mother with that mouth ?	i 'd kiss your mother with this mouth . i mean , if she was n't , you know ...
so far away ? in xenia ?	yeah , whatever .
check this out . hurry !	i better go , dad .
hurry .	what is it now ?
do n't tell me . another vision of incomparable beauty ?	beauty ? no . we 're talking goddess .
i get it now . you and me . we 're dead .	dead ?
our plane crashed . in the grand canyon . a big fiery explosion . we never made it to l.a. they needed dental records to identify us . and this place . this . actually . is . heaven .	then there must be a whole room , made completely of chocolate .
do n't be such a pansy . all of this is yours .	it 's a lot to digest . imagine how you 'd feel .
i feel like i 'm entering a forbidden tomb ...	... where they get all the really good porno channels on cable .
oh , how inappropriate is that !	take a whiff of heaven .
how would you like it if i did that to your mother 's panties ?	i 'd call you a sick , twisted fuck . but this is different . she was n't your mother mother --
a couple of boys fighting over a pair of red silk panties is nothing compared to what he 's seen .	yeah , he 's probably been serving cocktails , so to speak , at the orgies .
you 're late , bro !	sorry . ginger got a little , you know , enthusiastic .
you 'll never believe who 's in there .	it better not be my aunt trudy .
i feel like i 've just been hit by a mack truck .	with a refrigerated cargo bed full of sirloin tip .
i thought i loved her .	chicks are like buses . if you miss one , do n't sweat it . there 's another coming 'round the corner .
hell yes , all hundred and seventeen of 'em !	no , leave one . somebody 's grandmother might want one .
and while you 're at it , i 'll take ten dozen of those puppies with the springy heads .	i love those springy head puppies !
get them together .	brilliant ! molly , give me all you 've got . for merk .
holy stinkers , what were you thinking ?	we wanted to challenge the notions of classic beauty . we wanted to showcase women throughout the world .
you got everything you ever wanted .	except the girl . the only one that really mattered .
naked girls , wild sex , video games . no wonder it 's called `` heaven . ''	this is a fun place ... but we do n't usually come here until after the orgies .
never say never .	oh , god . look . look .
every one of these women thinks she should be the next angel of the month . it 's your job , ted , to decide which of them is right .	let me get this straight ...
if it is n't straight by now , son , you probably should see a doctor .	these are real , live women ?
we do n't generally feature blow-up dolls in our magazine . but hey , if you think there 's a market for it .	god , i love being dead .
what gives , don corleone ?	we reinvented ourselves .
new hushpuppies do n't make a new man .	you 've obviously never had your dogs nestled in thousand dollar italian loafers .
that explains the emptiness that haunts me .	jealousy is so unattractive .
not bad for a hack . he has a future in yellow journalism .	he kicked major ass and you know it .
would n't it be awesome if we were about to say the exact same thing ?	from your lips , to god 's ears .
you go first .	ladies first . i insist .
well . the prom 's coming up .	yeah ?
and i was wondering .	yeah ?
teddy ? would you please please please take me to the prom ?	shut up ! are you serious ? of course i will ... of course .
ted , have you lost your mind ?	you like me . i like you . i guess it 's pretty obvious to everyone .
i do n't like you . we 're just friends .	but that smile .
oh , ted , duh . i smile at everyone since i got my braces off .	so you 'll think about it ?
you really do n't get it , do you ? i am genetically programmed to desire a big , buff , manly man who can defend and provide for me and my yet to be conceived offspring ! it 's , like , a caveman thing !	so that 's a maybe ?
great jacket , teddy bear .	yeah ? you like ?
hi , teddy bear .	christy ? you want to be in `` heaven ? ''
i thought i 'd be nervous , but you sure know how to make a girl feel relaxed , teddy bear .	i do ? i mean , yeah , i do .
i have to admit , i am so totally turned on . we should do it . now .	do it ?
i remember the first time you walked into mrs. temple 's class in 2nd grade . blue gingham dress . blond ponytail .	which you pulled , hard !
remember dress up day ? you and charlie lifting skirts during recess .	i miss those days , when schoolyard sexual harassment was without consequence .
well ?	you have changed since second grade .
i mean , what do you think ?	you expect me to think at a time like this ? there is n't a drop of blood in my brain .
i was always too shy to admit how much i liked you .	come on , i was hamburger . you were porterhouse .
god , you are so hot .	then you better get in the water , before you get burned .
we have a truckload of strawberries arriving on tuesday morning .	we own a small family grocery store .
we ca n't accept it . it 's much too expensive . right , dear ?	of course , dumpling . its very nice of ted but ...
sweetheart , what is it ?	i always wanted craftsman tools . he even got me the limited edition buckeye colors .
ted , we put a lot of love in our business .	we wanted you and jimmy to have it someday . something real and honest .
you have to understand . this was a big shock , for all of us . one minute you 're our little boy , of whom we could not be more proud . the next minute you 're the owner of this whole pornographic empire .	but that does n't make you the boss of everything , son .
we 're not ashamed of you , teddy . we do n't approve of the magazine or the models or the so-called `` flesh parties '' you attend . but we can get past all that .	we miss you . we miss our son .
we think you should give up the magazine . sell it . let someone else run it . whatever it takes .	we want you to go to college , find a career you love , marry a nice girl from a nice family , and live happily ever after .
we understand your disappointment , teddy . christy is a pretty , sexy , provocative , voluptuous ... we ... uh ... we understand your disappointment .	it 's my private business ! mine !
i remember spring break of my senior year . seems like a lifetime ago .	dad , please .
grandpa was so strong back then . working from the crack of dawn . so proud of his peaches .	remember how you struggled through that whole facts of life talk and then found out i knew more than you ?
you 're way ahead of me again ?	it was the year of the rhizopus rot . grandpa almost lost the farm . you sacrificed your dream to go to the prize hog festival . and in the end you saved the peaches and you did n't have to slaughter your sow .
the lesson being ?	sometimes you have to do stuff you do n't want to do . it 's all part of growing up . and it usually works out peachy in the end .
you guys are my parents .	of course we are .
son .	well , why should i ?
they had a rough life . your father was a bouncer . your mother was , well , a two-bit stripper . there was no place for a baby .	i guess .
they did do one great thing . they gave us our boy .	yeah .
be a sport . how bad could spring break in los angeles be ?	i guess we could go to disneyland or something .
think of it as a rite of passage to manhood .	like one of those `` national geographic '' specials with the topless chicks ?
whatever helps you cope .	i guess it 's better than having tribal patterns carved in my face .
there ya go . always remember , focus on the peach ...	... not the pit .
ted , it 's your dad . i have a question for you . i do n't know how to put it tactfully . you know i 'm lousy with words .	just say it , dad .
i know they were simple people , but did this trip help your college fund at all ?	dad , let 's just say i can buy anything i want in the whole bookstore . including the bookstore .
finally , some gratitude .	we 're grateful , ted . it 's not that . those craftsman tools ... they 're a dream come true .
but those are our dreams , son . we have to make them come true .	consider me your fairy godfather , except without the fairy part . no more mealy apples and bruised bananas , ever , for the rest of your lives .
sorry i --	it 's okay . you need me ?
i paid off the mortgage ! i ordered that winnebago you always wanted ! now you 're ashamed of me ?	you ordered a winnebago ?
that is your dream , not mine . my dream is so far beyond anything you people could even imagine .	watch your tone , mister .
shut your pie hole , jimmy .	i will not have my boys arguing .
i-i do n't have the keys .	they 're in the ignition , silly .
you do know how to drive ?	i do n't have much experience with a ... uh ... stick .
now release the brake . and slide the stick into first gear .	got it .
the first time can be awkward . you just have to get on and try again .	i do n't even know if i should be doing this . it 's a very expensive car .
it 's your car . these are all your cars .	some of them have to be automatics .
i 'm ted , by the way . i think i forgot to say that .	i know . i 'm ginger . miss april .
the one with the horses .	that 's me .
hey , ted . wan na go shopping ?	shopping , really ? i should tell my friend .
do n't worry . he found the chocolate room .	hi ho , silver .
who exactly are you ?	what do you mean ? i 'm ted nelson .
or do you have a taste for the good life , ted ? it 's in your blood .	i always knew there was more . i felt it .
teddy ? i was thinking .	hmmm ?
after graduation ... maybe we could go away together ?	whatever you want .
teddy , i thought we were having a moment here .	of course we were .
ted ! do something !	what do you want me to do ?
this is humiliating . we 're being ejected from a prom !	hang in there , i 'll think of something .
well ?	i guess ... i do n't know ... i guess we should leave if we 're not wanted .
oh , sweetheart ! we wish we could be right there to hug the living daylights out of you !	but if you 're watching this , then it means we bit the dust .
but do n't worry ... we 'll be in heaven . the real heaven , i mean . not that heaven is an actual place , but more like a state of being . or not being . who knows . maybe we know now .	if you 're anything like yours truly , then you probably figure we did n't want you when you were born , so who cares if we 're dead ? am i right ?
but we did want you . it 's just that you do n't always get to keep what you want . we knew you needed a real mom and dad .	we had no idea the nudie magazine we started in the garage would turn into all this .
can you believe that was me ?	before we knew it , we created the most popular men 's magazine in the entire nation . the rest is history .
so here we are . dead . but we never want you to want for anything . that is , we want you to have everything .	everything .
you 're on the next plane home .	i 'm helen mcdole . your father 's executive secretary .
no problem , consider it done . i had this idea of shooting on location . outdoors , you know ? maybe at some famous xenia landmarks . you think that would be a problem ?	we 'll send you the release forms , ted . our staffers will help in any way they can .
it 's a little more serious than that , bill . the stockholders have requested a meeting . they want our guarantee that this will never happen again . some of them are even calling for ted 's resignation .	look , the girls of xenia are gorgeous , you 'll see . next month we 'll be back to normal .
your parents never wanted to interfere with your life , ted . they knew your mom and dad loved you very much . they knew they did the right thing . but that does n't mean they did n't watch you and miss you , from afar .	you mean they knew who i was ?
i wondered about them , for so many years . i wondered if i looked like them , acted like them . i wondered why they gave me up .	giving you up was the most unselfish thing they ever did . when they founded `` heaven , '' they wished they could take you back but it was too late . all they could do was build the empire , knowing that someday it would all be yours .
my legacy .	your parents would be crushed to think you were n't happy with it .
they 're not my parents , helen . my parents are back in xenia and i hurt them very much .	i understand .
and the girl i love , she hates `` heaven . '' if i keep it , she 'll never respect me .	but how can you respect yourself if you do n't ?
how are the hometown folks treating you , back in xenia ?	well , jay . they 've been exceptionally supportive .
i 'm no stranger to the notion of philanthropy . andrew carnegie has long been one of my idols .	what about the future ? you planning to rock the boat at all ? stir things up in `` heaven ? ''
matter of fact , jay , my uncle and i are planning to rethink the magazine . to expand the traditional western notions of `` beauty . ''	i see , so you 'd be open to little ladies from pasadena , who want to show you their knickers ?
mom , dad . meatloaf has come to represent all that ted hates about his mediocre life and the world we live in . he 's what you 'd call clinically bummed .	why ca n't we have pot roast or stroganoff or even a little london broil ? i mean , for god 's sake , we own a grocery store !
james , what are you doing here ?	you can call me jimmy again . sheryl petersen said james sounds too pretentious .
sheryl petersen is , what , nine years old , what does she know ?	she knew exactly where you were staying , which you neglected to tell me , your own brother .
impressive . this is bigger than our whole house .	most places are , jimmy .
they say money ca n't buy happiness but this is a reasonably good facsimile .	so , what brings you here at his hour ?
my new bike .	very funny .
i came to ask permission to take custody of your room .	my room ?
better view , more spacious , new carpet . it 's a no-brainer .	it 's not up to me .
mom and dad said it 's yours . they seem to think you 're coming home .	you can have it , then . i 'm not going back there .
if you could just sign right there .	you want it in writing ?
that 's it ? i mean , you do n't want to order room service or anything ? we could play games and watch movies and stuff .	are you kidding ? mom and dad discover i 'm gone and i 'll be doing hard time .
are they okay ?	aside from the fact that mom 's eyes are nearly swollen shut from crying and dad spends all his time under the car trying to fix stuff that is n't broken , things could n't be better .
i miss them , too .	you ca n't come back . that is , you can , but your things will be in the room you currently think of as mine .
you 're a peach .	funny you should say that . my grandfather was a peach farmer .
he was my grandfather , too .	i meant biologically .
that 's a crappy thing to say .	look ted . i 'm cool with everything . you 've long been dissatisfied with our mediocre little town . you 've always had an itch for the good life . i 'm happy for you . this could n't happen to a nicer guy .
but just for the record , my mom is a kick-ass schoolteacher and my dad is the best damn auto mechanic this side of the himalayas . you seem to have forgotten they opened nelson 's family market so they could build something permanent , a legacy , for us . their kids .	i did n't forget .
great .	from my wise , albeit youthful , vantage point , the world is your oyster . you scored big .
so , william randolph . your last big scoop contrasted the popularity of rice crispie treats and chocolate snickerdoodles at the annual bake sale .	that 's just one example . my reporting has made a difference .
let me guess : retail sales of little chocolate sprinkles have gone through the roof !	the school dumpsters used to overflow to the point where the stench was unbearable . my award winning expos changed all that . the city added an extra weekday trash pick-up .
is it true ? is ignorance bliss ?	look , i loved `` exposed ! '' and i hate it that you got busted . i know the school paper sucks in comparison , but it 's really not that bad .
do n't even tell me you 're hot for miss titty pom poms over there .	christy 's a very talented journalist . i see a pulitzer in her future .
i did n't know they gave them for best lip gloss retention during a blow job .	me-ow .
go ahead . ask her to the prom . get it over with .	i have absolutely no intention --
i tried to warn you , william randolph . she 's got stiletto heels hidden in those keds .	but you triple-dog-dared me .
a few billion bucks and suddenly he 's cro-magnon man of the year .	it 's so nice to have friends like you , christy .
what is it , william randolph ? your balls need scratching ?	your article sucked .
in what sense ?	in the sense that there is no `` hidden agenda '' behind a bake sale that raised five hundred dollars for seeing eye dogs .
ah ha ! it was so well hidden , you did n't even know it was there .	come on , julie . do n't screw up . you have some real talent .
just because someone died and made you king of the publishing world does n't mean you 're even one ounce smarter than you were a week ago .	i 'm trying to help .
i 'm still better than you . nothing changed except the decimal point in your savings account .	that 's not entirely true .
what do you want from me ? i 'm trying to be fair . but i ca n't keep you on staff if you turn every pta meeting into an agent orange cover up .	then i 'll write about you .
me ?	`` local boy inherits more money than god . '' call me crazy , but i smell human interest .
i have to admit , i always felt ... different .	different how ? different like a dwarf at a basketball game ? or different like a lesbian in pumps ?
i do n't get the distinction .	could everybody else tell you were different , or were you the only one who knew ?
i felt limited . i felt confined . i felt like i was suffocating .	i see . so more like a tight rope walker who secretly wants to be a trapeze artist .
i guess .	interesting .
she said peanuts , you cretin .	you never know around here .
do n't write that part .	is this an gritty expos or a candy ass press release ?
write what you want . just try not to make it so obvious that you 're crazy about me .	life must be peachy on planet ted .
funny you should say `` peachy . ''	i did my homework . your grandfather was a peach farmer .
my adoptive grandfather . who knows what my biological grandfather did .	undoubtedly an aristocratic bartender of some sort .
considering this is your first time on a private jet , on which you are interviewing the world 's most eligible bachelor , you are extremely cavalier .	i bet there are lots and lots of mirrors on planet ted .
see ? you 're impertinent , rude , sarcastic .	and this is not my first time on a private jet , so quit acting like i 'm rebecca of sunnybrook farm .
well ? what do you think of her ?	you 're so twitterpated you do n't even see the miner 's hat and the pickax .
charlie 's right . jealousy is so unattractive .	second only to unbridled , narcissistic conceit .
why ca n't you be nice to me ?	you 've got enough people kissing your ass .
wow ... you clean up nice .	put your eyeballs back in your head , william randolph . i 'm on assignment . a girl has to fit in .
where are we going ?	to the best hiding place in the world .
i ca n't believe your dad built this for you .	he did n't . he had it built .
whatever .	not `` whatever . '' it 's two different things .
he cared enough to want you to have it .	he phoned it in .
i see .	i doubt it .
now it makes sense , the whole neo bohemian , down with hypocrisy , fight the power crap . you 're a poor little rich girl .	the ozone must be fully depleted on planet ted .
you think my dad would have been like that if i knew him ? you think he would have bought me a stadium , instead of teaching me how to play ball ?	your dad taught you everything .
i mean my father .	a father is nothing but sperm , ted . it takes a real man to be a dad .
it 's all so complicated .	it 's incredibly simple .
i feel like i 'm being drawn and quartered . like every part of me is being pushed and pulled and tugged in a different direction .	eventually you 'll let go .
and then what ?	then you 'll see who 's really holding on to you .
you 're amazing .	i know .
even when you infuriate me , i still want to kiss you .	but you never do .
cut to the chase , william randolph . your audience is way ahead of you .	in a word : merk . exposed .
that 's two words . and i 'm out of the `` exposed '' business , remember ? i need to graduate . besides , merk 's a boy scout .	there 's got ta be something . we have to dig deeper .
you forget , i dislike you at least as much as him .	he shut down your paper ! you 're stuck writing articles about swap meets and raffles and pta brunches !
a good journalist can take lemons and make lemonade . i 'm honing my craft .	then you wo n't mind covering that watermelon seed spitting contest next week ...
that 's probably my office .	well ? where the hell are you ?
he 's on the move ?	i got an anonymous tip and an address in cincinnati .
i do n't know . this place seems pretty tame .	you expected whips , chains , merk being cattle-prodded by some dominatrix in a leather hood ?
at least it 's not another 4-h meeting or a big brother barbecue .	amen to that .
look at us . it 's one o'clock in the morning , on a school night . we 're in a smoky nightclub , hoping to catch our principal with some big city tart .	i 'm trembling with excitement .
that has more to do with your proximity to me .	my desire betrays me , like goosebumps on my flesh .
i have a bit of a goosebump fetish . not many people know that .	i figured you for more of a hairy armpit guy .
shoes , if you want to know the truth . shoes are my thing .	wearing them ? or humping them ?
my fantasy is a totally naked woman , wearing nothing but a timex and suede clogs .	that 's refreshingly deviant .
what about you ?	i 'm very aural .
tell me more .	sounds , voices , music , humming . all of it can turn me on , or off , like a switch .
i see .	i had a portuguese boyfriend who could read the phone book and melt me .
a portuguese boyfriend . sounds very `` cosmo . ''	you live and learn . i realized the most important thing to me , above all , is trust .
turned out to be a scoundrel , eh ? i saw that one coming .	you lose trust in someone and it 's over , done , gone , forever .
do you trust me , julie ?	not a chance .
come on .	trust is something you earn , over time . you do n't just inherit it overnight like a gazillion dollar empire .
i want you to trust me .	maybe someday .
julie , i 'll tell you something that is the god 's honest truth . i 've seen a lot of really beautiful girls . i mean a lot . but none of them make me feel like you do .	that 's hard to believe .
i have to be honest with you , ted . i really despise `` the girls of xenia . ''	i know , their small town mentality can be maddening .
i mean your pictorial . it bothers me , profoundly .	aw julie , it 's my job . it 's like being a doctor .
you 're telling me you do n't get aroused by a roomful of naked breasts .	you 've seen one naked breast , you 've seem them all .
which explains the continued success of `` heaven '' for how many decades ?	you 're quick . i like that .
you think you 're working with chimps here ?	the thing is , i made a commitment . i said i 'd do it and i have to keep my word .
julie , wow . i was afraid you left . i was afraid i 'd never see you again .	i 'm not going anywhere , ted . you 're the one with the champagne wishes and caviar dreams .
and i thought maybe i 'd take up boating . i 've always wanted to be a `` coxswain . ''	very ambitious . i like that .
the thing is , i 'll need a first mate .	i know where you can find any number of naked girls who 'd love to hop on board .
planet ted . five years from now . what 's happening ?	i graduated from college . did great , summa cum laude and all . and i 'm about to launch a brand new magazine called `` exposed ! '' an homage to miss julie conroy of xenia , ohio .
i know where you can find an excellent editor-in-chief .	yellow pages ?
they 're playing our song . dare i ask for this dance ?	you better .
what is this ? does everybody know everything i 'm about to say or do every freakin ' minute of the day ?	no cursing in this house , young man . use the strong vocabulary god gave you .
that 's part of growing up , honey .	what ? having spring break ruined by will readings ?
what about charlie ? you boys could make it a little adventure .	charlie , at a will reading ? what did i do to deserve this ?
i 'm all right , mom . i 'm not in siberia , you know .	did you have a nice flight ? are they taking good care of you ?
yeah , i 'm doing fine . i have so much to tell you . i do n't even know where to begin .	save it , honey . we want to hear every detail when you get back , but we do n't want you to run up mr. zukerman 's phone bill .
well ? surprised ?	what is all this ? when are you coming home ?
just a few tokens of my affection . i 'll be back soon , do n't worry .	everything is lovely , ted , but much too expensive .
oh , good lord . are those neptunes ?	only the best for my mother .
you promise you 'll finish school ?	i 'll make you very proud .
you do n't have to work another day in your lives .	but how would we pay our bills ?
do n't you get it ? in one day i earn more interest than the store 's entire annual revenue .	oh . goodness .
you 're free . you can do anything you ever wanted to do !	like what ?
but who would run the store ?	forget the store . think big .
everything i am is because of you . can you ever forgive me ?	oh , teddy . we missed you so much .
i need your help . i 'm really in deep shit .	do n't say `` shit , '' honey . use the strong vocabulary god gave you .
i like you , ted . you know that . i liked you before you were filthy rich .	thanks , principal merkin .
i 'll be blunt . i know you can take it .	yes , sir . i 'll brace myself .
ted , you are the best editor this school paper ever had . you do n't need to be pandering flesh . it 's nonsense . it 's beneath you .	you think i ought to just tell them thanks but no thanks ? i do n't want your silly billion dollar empire ?
that 's a good start , yes . a very good start .	are you kidding ? this magazine is my dream . it 's every red-blooded , heterosexual male 's dream .
i never figured you for a pimp .	have you ever even looked at `` heaven ? ''
what kind of sick question is that ? i 'll be watching you , young man . your money and power mean nothing here . nothing .	i guess you wo n't be wanting that rolex i sent you , then ?
with all due respect to merk , he does n't have to read my magazine . but he has no right to stop others . ever hear of the first amendment ?	we can not afford free speech if it excises the moral fiber of this community !
honestly , merk . it 's like you were never seventeen and the head of a media empire .	rules are rules .
come on , it 's our only senior prom .	deaf ears , mr. nelson . i answer to a higher power .
you 're crossing the line , mr. nelson .	a statue in front of city hall , dedicated to principal dick merkin ?
i 'm warning you .	a new pediatric wing at the hospital ? a presidential campaign ? name it . anything .
you kicked us off your turf , merk . do n't rain on our parade .	mr. nelson , you disappoint me . first you break our school board rules . then you break the law .
what law , merk ? having fun ? letting down our hair on prom night ?	our state has a zero tolerance policy for underage drinking .
you called the cops on us ?	alcohol does horrible things to a developing young mind .
smashing ! welcome to the family , ted . you are going to breathe some new life into this place . you are going to set the world on fire ! you are going to ... call me uncle billy ? please ?	uh , sure . uncle billy .
you do like girls , do n't you ?	of course i like girls .
a lot ? i mean , a whole lot ?	as much as possible .
the parties are held in here when the weather dips below seventy . which is seldom .	seldom ? no kidding ?
ah , in other words , this is the apres-orgy salon ?	indeed it is . during the day , visitors prefer to be outside , au naturel . as it were .
maybe she needs help , ted . you should be a gentleman .	i ... uh ... i think she 's doing fine on her own .
we do n't allow tipn , ted .	tipping ?
there you are , ted-baby . everything all right ?	yeah . everything 's cool .
you ready for your big coming out party ? everybody 's dying to meet you .	just a couple of finishing touches . my parents always said you never get a second chance to make a good first impression .
truth is , i 'm a little nervous .	you ? nervous ? why on earth should you be nervous ?
all those people out there . it 's a lot of pressure .	huh ! you laugh in the face of pressure !
i do ?	you are a multi-media magnate . the tycoon of tits . the baron of bottoms .
you 're the sultan of semen . the monarch of masturbation . the merchant prince of lust . you . ted . are the king of coitus .	me ? the king of coitus ?
the supreme sovereign of sexuality .	whoa . but ... that 's the thing ... i 've never even actually ...
i told you you could do it .	i was like a different person tonight .
you were the new and improved you .	i would have been laughed right out of xenia .
no one will be laughing at you now , ted . you can take that to the bank .	it 's really going to be strange going home in a couple of days .
you are home . but go ahead , finish school , do what you feel you need to do . in the meantime , i 'll be your point person here on the magazine .	really ? you 'd do that for me ?
i 've been very lazy for a long , long time .	you seem like you 're anything but lazy , uncle billy .
i never finished school myself . never had to . my brother built this empire from nothing but his wife 's perky tits and a whole lot of gumption . he gave me a cushy job on a silver platter . i never struggled for a second .	my parents always say hard work builds character .
it 's not like i did n't have ideas , i had plenty of ideas . but i never even shared them with your father . never had the guts .	what kind of ideas ?
well ... for one thing ... i think it 's despicable that we exclude so many women that only fit our western notion of `` classic beauty . ''	you think we should be more open minded ?
the world is a big , beautiful place . we can open new markets in africa and asia . imagine the dali lhama reading our magazine .	in other words , our scope is too narrow .
at our press conference tomorrow , i think we should announce our plans to explore the world . not just a few leggy 36d 's , with blond hair upstairs and down .	that 's perfect .
do n't forget to tell them all your qualifications .	i 'm ted nelson . i guess you already know that part . for two years i 've been the editor of the high school paper in xenia , ohio . i 've won some awards , made a difference . i 've always had journalism in my soul . now i know why .
so far , so good . some of them have real angel potential .	really ? so i 'm doing ok ?
my father must 've been amazing .	he was in a league of his own .
i never saw anybody turn so many shades of red .	i ca n't wait to see the pictures .
such enthusiasm . have i told you lately how proud i am of you ?	seriously ? i 'm doing all right ?
i owe it all to you . without your help i 'd be lost .	i wish i knew you years ago , when my brother was alive . i wish he never gave you up .
i 'd love to , but i really need to crack the books . final exams are coming up and i 've been slacking .	you 're right . i should work , too . our first issue together is almost ready to print .
thanks , uncle billy . thanks for everything .	you 're a great kid . do n't you forget it .
yes ?	we 've got a huge problem with the magazine , ted-baby . our readers hate it . hate it . we need to talk .
i loved my brother . i stood by his wishes to let his son run the company . a son he never knew . a son that he and his wife gave away at birth . a son who was raised in a world quite different from our own . nevertheless , i was there for the lad . i guided him as best i could . but he 's only seventeen , with a mind of his own and judgment that is , well , frankly , not a chip off the old block . there is only one clear solution ... and i think we all know what that is --	-- peaches ! canned peaches !
what are you doing ?	my job . back off , benedict .
thanks for teaching me an important lesson . what makes a family is love , not blood .	all is fair in `` heaven , '' ted-baby .
that 's right . and guess who 's the new king of the unemployment line .	aw , come on , kid . throw me a bone . i 'm your uncle for gosh sakes .
in a hurry , are we ?	i was in the middle of a melodramatic exit . it would n't really make a statement if i tiptoed out the door ... what are you selling ?
bad news .	people pay good money for that ?
oh no . no way . i 've had all the bad news i can take for one day .	it 's about your parents .
my parents ? what do you mean ?	i 'm terrible at this . i blurt . i 'm a blurter . your parents ... they ... well ... they exist no further . skinny-dipping . the amazon . piranhas . it was n't pretty .
you 've got the wrong guy . the closest my parents have been to the amazon is the brazilian pavilion at epcot .	well kid , i 'm speaking of ... your biological parents .
how quaint .	it 's spring break . i do n't want to go to a will reading .
are you familiar with `` heaven ? ''	i 'm seventeen . i know it like the back of my hand .
so , did you set 'em all straight on the ugly facts of life ?	i have the feeling , they got it down already . they 're a step ahead of us , artie .
talk to me artie .	kelly van ryan ...
... is accusing me of rape . jimmy told me . apparently i 'm the last to know ...	sam ... i ... sandra van ryan 's been on the horn with every member of the school board all day long . she 's pushing for suspension ...
all i can tell you sam , is hang in there . they clear you of this mess , you get reinstated , with back pay ...	that 's great . i 'll just tell my creditors i 'm not a rapist . no problem ... shit . i ca n't believe the board 's going to act without even hearing my side of it .
how you doing , artie ?	i ... you know ... i ...
not that i 'm going to be much good after last night ...	eat a power bar .
is that sandra van ryan 's kid ?	kelly .
she 's going to wash your jeep ?	senior class fund-raising gig . i told 'em they could hose down the jeep . hey , come on . it 's for a good cause .
you look pretty .	thanks .
hey , i 've got it , i may as well spend it , right ? i 've always wanted to live where i could dive for my dinner .	and where might that be ?
i was thinking , antigua , maybe .	i love antigua . maybe i 'll come visit you .
how soon can we get something ?	we can get blood type right away . dental records will take longer . you want dna , that can take weeks .
merritt , forensics .	the teeth doin ' any talkin ' ?
ray . stop calling . i told you the dental records will take time ...	what about the blood ?
could be hers . types match . could be a lot of other people 's too ...	second you get something on those teeth , i want it
gator ca n't see what 's in front of it for shit . they see out the sides . that one do n't even know walter 's arm 's in his mouth .	what if something distracts it and it snaps anyway ?
you come all the way out here to watch walter ?	i was wondering if i could ask you a few questions .
about suzie ?	actually , i was wondering if i might ask you about ray duquette .
got sort of hung up on her , from what hear .	she still work there ?
no . not after that night . i do n't know what happened . maybe he caught her with some john ... all i know is , the next morning the girl was gone and there was a dead boy ... indian kid named davy . used to live down the road there in a wrecked car . him and suzie were at the glades that night . it was right after that , ray got suzie busted and sent her away . that 's what there is to say about ray duquette .	was there ever any kind of investigation ...
was n't enough van ryan had to destroy the people who invested here . he got to be old , he and his rich cronies would come down here , hunt and whore , act like assholes . one trip he showed up with this young girl he 'd picked up somewhere , gotten her pregnant then dumped her in the swamp . that came with her .	and the child ...
she had it , before she drank herself to death . was n't exactly a love child ...	suzie . then you 're not her grandmother ...
so suzie and sandra van ryan were half- sisters .	and the other girl , kelly . suzie 's niece .
you okay ?	i 'm fine . nice tv .
how are you , kelly ? would you like to take a break for a minute ?	i just want to get it over with . my mom 's making me do this . i just want to forget it .
the next thing ... his hand was in my shorts ... you know , from behind . his fingers ... his fingers ...	take your time .
they were in me . both places ... you know .	i understand .
he said something like , `` do you want it dirty7 '' or something . i tried to turn away , but he pushed me to the floor .	was there penetration ? did he put himself inside you ?
yes . i said stop . i screamed . i mean that 's how it sounded in my head . he hurt me ...	that 's okay , kelly . you 're doing fine . but i have to ask you something here . when you say it hurt . was this the first time a man was inside you ?
no . i 've done it a couple of times , i mean with guys i dated . but this hurt ... like , he was built ... you know ...	he was large ?
did you try to fight him ?	i ... he had my wrists pinned behind me . i remember my hands were cold . '
then what ?	he kept saying , `` let it happen , let it happen . '' then he just stopped .
you mean he withdrew ...	not at first . he was still inside but he was n't moving or anything ... he said we had this secret . and that now he 'd be able to help me ... because we were close ... something like that . i do n't know . it 's hard to remember , exactly .
try , kelly .	i know one thing he said . it was when ... when he took himself out and was standing up . he said , `` do n't worry , i did n't come . '' i ca n't forget that . he said , `` no little girl can ever make me come . ''
if old pictures interest you , come back some time , there 's quite a collection down in the pagoda . i 'll see you get a proper tour .	i 'd like that .
and when you turned her toward the door , where did you expect her to go , without a car ?	again . i think we covered this . i told her i was going to call a cab .
did you call anyone ? did you call her house to see if she got home ? did you call the masons ?	no .
were n't you a little worried about her ... ?	there 's a strip mall not half a mile from my house . there 's phones there . i cruised the place , but i did n't see her . i figured she was probably there but that she was angry and did n't want to be found . i do n't know ... maybe i should have called . but it 's not like kelly ca n't take care of herself . i figured we 'd just take it up on monday , in the office .
is n't that against the law , peeking into windows ?	suzie toller is missing .
how long ?	she did n't cone home last night . we found her car at the bus terminal , but nothing to suggest she bought a ticket .
maybe she used another name .	ray thinks she was murdered .
i do n't know what to say ...	you could tell me where you were last night .
kelly 's file . read it . you 're going to find an angry , sexually confused girl who 's made threats on her mother 's life and a female lover she 'd never identify .	suzie ?
i 've got that two o'clock in town .	back to the land of grownups .
that would make it about the time of her old man 's suicide . you do n't think that could explain some erratic behavior ?	all i 'm saying is , i think we should go slow here .
it 's our job , gloria .	hunter 's making it our job because sandra van ryan 's got a bug up his ass . you know that as well as i do . we 're gon na trash this guy 's life and i keep asking myself if it 's really necessary .
same as him . they saw her come . they saw her go . they saw him follow .	still does n't explain why he could n't catch up with her . i mean how long does it take to put on a shirt ?
we failed to mention the mower guy 's a drunk , that he was after more beer and never really saw kelly go into the house , so he ca n't say how long she was in there . same with the kids . they saw her running down the street , but that 's it . with no physical evidence , what do we have ? her word against his .	you 're telling me you believe the guy ?
you can go up to one of those trees and peel the bark . you know what you get ? more bark . and more bark . there 's no core . tree 's not good tar anything but sucking up water . and now they ca n't get rid of them . they 've tried poisons . nothing works . they do n't die .	yeah , well , van ryan got his . i do n't imagine he gives a shit now .
you remember that little girl walked out of our talk at blue bay ?	the skinny brunette .
this is where she lives . she wants to talk . beats the shit out of me why she would call me at all . i busted her once for possession . she wound up doing about six months at camp nine .	you mean camp sixty-nine .
that 's what they called it when i was in juvenile . it 's a pretty dismal place .	it 's a shithole . but she was dirty , what was i gon na do ?
you saw the news today ?	lombardo 's settlement ?
think back , before the suit was filed , before the trial . lombardo had an affair with sandra , right ? so why not tell us about the affair ? i mean it could be a hell of a motive for kelly to fabricate her charge in the first place .	maybe lombardo 's attorney was saving the affair for the trial .
i thought of that . then i said , come on , you 're lombardo . your reputation is getting trashed . you want to stop the bleeding . you do n't want to sit in jail for three months . unless ...	unless what ?
they chumped us , gloria , right from the start .	why ? you ask me , lombardo had it pretty good already , nice job in a beautiful setting , popular , an active social life . he 's gon na put this all on the line for some dicey play like what you 're describing ...
so what about the girls ? suzie 's poor , but why would kelly have to steal from her own mother ? surely her father ...	her father did n't leave her squat . the kid 's got money in trust from her grandfather , but she ca n't touch that till her mother dies and sandra seems to have the idea that kelly ought to learn the value of a buck .
this one 's got you working overtime , has n't it ?	i flat do n't like the guy , glory . he 's dirty . and i 'll tell you something else . you want to know how old man lombardo lost his money ? he was fucked out of it by old man van ryan , on a little item known as the salt creek land deal . it was after the war . van ryan set up a corporation to develop swamp land , got investors like lombardo to put up money , then turned around and got the state to declare the area an ecological preserve , on the sly , of course , but everyone knew it was him . the freeway went to the coast , right where van ryan wanted it .
eliminate the competition .	you got it . the rich got richer . while the saps like lombardo went belly-up in the swamp .
where 'd you come up with this stuff , anyway ?	i net a guy in a bar .
which she might have saved , if she had n't set out to destroy the man 's life .	what ? you would n't go after some guy you thought raped your daughter ? cone on . she bought the same story we did ...
guess i kind of lost it there .	you could say that .
we all have ...	i mean something bad , gloria , something bad you saw coning , and you did n't do anything , and then it happened . i did that once . i do n't want to do it again .
it 's starting , gloria . this is how it begins ...	ray . we do n't know anything yet . she could be anywhere ...
i 'm gon na take you back to the office . will you put out a call on suzie 's car for me ?	you have someplace to be ?
if you want company ...	just check out the car .
two kids could 've gotten into a fight , lost a couple of teeth .	those are suzie toller 's teeth .
where 's the body ?	the swamp , most likely ... lombardo 's a swamp rat , knows the body will never be found there . but he 's made a mistake .
her grandmother said she 'd been threatening to run away . and i found the car at the miami bus terminal .	you do n't think sam could 've put it there ?
poor dumb suzie , she never had a chance .	we do n't know that , ray ...
will you do me one favor ?	ray , you heard him ...
stick with me on this gloria . i need you ...	and if the teeth are n't suzie 's ? you 'll give this up ?
i 'm tired , ray . i 'm going home .	where 's lombardo ?
he 's leaving the country . and i do n't give a shit .	the blood type on the rocks matches suzie 's .
that bothers you ?	yeah , maybe , a little .
you did n't tell me you were gon na put me on the fucking news .	we need to tape the interview , suzie . no one will see it but us . now when was this , that mr. lombardo gave you the ride ?
about a year ago .	he dropped jimmy off first ?
yeah .	and when he arrived at your house , was anyone there ?
no .	so you were alone .
yes .	did he come in with you ?
at that point were you able to fight him off ?	no . he stopped by himself . okay ? that 's all . let me go .
he did say something .	what was that ?
why ?	i think she 's acting . i think she set it up to be alone with him because she wanted him to come on to her . i think maybe she 's upset that he did n't ...
that does n't make him a child rapist . there 's something else . this girl 's had some problems . wrecked a couple of her mom 's cars . ran away ...	where 's this coming from ?
i want a full-scale investigation .	you know what that will mean for lombardo .
or maybe she thought that was what she wanted and she got a little more than she bargained for ...	the line i get on this guy , is that he 's done half the women in blue bay .
not that stuff about her running away , him trying to find her . that 's bullshit .	what about witnesses ?
we 've got three . guy mowing his yard , couple of kids playing hoops .	and what do they say ?
are you crazy , ray ?	you heard kelly say `` sam . '' that was lombardo on the phone . and you saw the girls ...
ray . the conversation on this tape is totally unintelligible . what we have here , is you on the van ryan property , without a proper warrant , shooting a porn flick ...	i do n't believe i 'm hearing this . a month ago you were pulling these two apart at the courthouse . they were acting . they were all acting , from the beginning . and we bought it , hook , line and sinker ... and now they 're home free with six million of sandra van ryan 's money .
oh , ray ... no ...	you think this is just about money , about us looking foolish ? question him . you 're gon na find a stone cold manipulative psychopath . and those girls are going to wind up dead ...
kelly 's next , gloria .	get off this ray , now . if there is any evidence here , it 's for homicide . you get an id , you call me .
i fucked up . i lost control of the situation , the one thing they train you for ... god , what did i do ?	just tell us what happened .
she bit you ?	bit , scratched . but i had her pinned . she calmed down . i was going to cuff her ... she said she thought she was going to be sick . she asked to use the bathroom .
i told her i was coming with her . she nodded , like she understood . we stood up together .	you did n't cuff her ?
the teeth , were they ...	suzie toller 's . and that 's the only thing saving your sorry ass .
you guess ? did he or did n't he ?	yeah ... okay ... he did
and then what ... he touched you ? did you maybe flirt a little ...	i wan na go home now .
what did you do then ?	shit , what difference does it make ... nobody 's gon na believe me anyway ...
suzie ! did this man rape you ?	okay ! he did . he pushed me to the floor and he did it to me . now , can i go home ?
he pushed into me ... i could n't stop him ... it hurt .	i 'm sorry ... you said it hurt ? why ?
ms. toller ?	i said he did .
this was n't my idea .	i 'm sorry ?
he was my friend at first . then i got busted ... he did n't even stick up for me . i had to go away to that hellhole . it 's like , you 're his favorite , then who cares ? you wan na know something ? when kelly said we should do this , i thought cool , all these big shots screwing me over , like that cop , duquette . now they 're gon na get screwed .	your honor ... please ...
come on . beats study hall , does n't it ?	no !
thank you , jimmy .	hey , man , at least in study hail i could meditate .
you know , i want to thank you for getting me into this class ... no way was my old man going to spring for the fees ...	hey , you 're working for it . least you 're supposed to be .
what about you , jimbo , you need a ride ?	what ?
a ride . you want one ?	yeah . but i got my bike .
it 's those rocks , up there .	you and suzie used to come out here together ?
yeah , sometimes . lots of the kids hang out here . you really think something bad happened to suzie ?	lombardo ever come out here ?
i say something funny ?	no . but i mean ... just the idea that mr. lombardo would ...
way i hear it , he was pretty tight with the kids , one of the guys ...	yeah , but ...
will you calm down . duquette 's gon na come to you just like he did to me . you 're gon na have to be ready for him .	yeah , but he ca n't push you around like he can me . you 've got family and they 've got clout . with we it 's different ... with me ...
yeah , i 've got family and they 've got clout and now you have me . right ? and sam . believe me , suzie , this dickhead 's not going to send you anywhere . he 's gon na try and rattle your cage , and that 's it . stay strong and he ca n't do shit .	man , i wan na smoke a joint .
i ca n't believe you called sam . what 's the matter with you ?	i 'm scared , that 's what . i 'm scared there 's no one to trust .
you 're gon na fuck me over , are n't you ?	oh , for christ 's sake .
you are .	are you retarded , or just brain dead from whiffin ' fumes out there in the swamp ...
anybody ever tell you that stuff will rot your brain ?	what brain ?
what are you looking at ?	nothing .
i thought we were goin ' to a movie .	i think we just need to get wasted .
i wan na live at the beach someday .	shit .
is there some reason why you 're here ?	curiosity , i guess .
excuse me ?	you all gon na go down to the caribbean together ?
the thing about it is , threesomes so rarely work out .	you 're out of your mind .
am i right , did sam sell you on the idea right up front , of whacking suzie ? that 's murder , kelly .	police -- god -- get a life .
get off my property .	i 'm not on your property !
is that sam lombardo ?	hi , mon .
which one of your `` bodyguards '' is that ?	whichever one i want .
okay , what 's the matter ?	you notice my new jumper ?
my friends buy me clothes , so i do n't look like trash .	i would hardly say you look like trash .
kelly . what is it ?	i miss dad .
jesus . well , i do too , sometimes ...	no you do n't .
what ?	i was raped . by sam lombardo .
he ... sam lombardo ?	yes . god , mom ...
you did n't have to fly back -- from -- wherever , for me ...	i 'm here to congratulate my friends and their children . i 'm leaving again tonight .
do n't bother . i 'm taking a trip .	where , the mall ?
okay , try me on sunday . i 'm going out to the everglades on saturday . you guys can wash the mud off .	deal . you know , i just looked out front . my ride was n't there . you suppose you could give me one ?
do n't forget the car wash .	i wo n't .
look , he forgot . i knew it .	no i did n't . check out the jeep . it 's nice and dirty for you . but you might want to wait a minute . the mercedes is leaving .
where 's the hose ? we can set up .	in back of the garage .
so , where you off to now ?	are n't you forgetting something ? your coupon . we got ta have it .
jeez , that thing ... ca n't you ...	rules are rules , mr. lombardo .
all right . i 'll have to look for it .	mr. lombardo . we 're running kind of late . how about if nicole goes on to the mansons ? you could give me a ride when you find the ticket .
kelly ...	drop dead ... you know where my mom is trying to get the money to pay you off ? she 's trying to break my trust . how do you like that ? i ca n't touch it until she 's dead and she wo n't give me a dime and now she 's trying to break it to pay you ...
jesus christ , what are you doing ?	so you got my mom 's money .
how much ?	about six and a half million dollars .
god , you scared the shit out of me . you must be crazy coming here .	of course i 'm crazy . ask my mom .
from now on , if we 're seen together , it 's got to be accidental . i thought that was understood ...	hey , come on ... we 've got to have at least one victory party .
the only way we 're gon na blow this now , is if we do it ourselves ...	do it to ourselves ?
we have to stick with the plan .	stick ?
kelly . is suzie there ?	yes .
shit . i was afraid of that . she left this garbled message on my machine . can you calm her down ?	why ca n't you come ...
no ! christ . listen , kelly , i 'm counting on you . you calm her down . i mean do whatever you have to , whatever it takes ...	you know what it takes .
i 'm here .	okay . i want you to hear this too . we 've got to be cool . all of us . people think i 'm rich , for christ 's sake . i 'm doing what rich guys do . i 'm spending my money . it 's more suspicious if i sit around doing nothing . now do n't let this cop fuck with your minds .
i 'm sorry , kelly . i 'm sorry it had to happen like this . she was losing it ...	there was no way . that cop would 've gotten her to tell him ... everything . she was weak and dumb ...
hello ?	hello .
i 'm really serious . that cop , he keeps watching me .	duquette . forget him ...
i ca n't help it . he gives me the creeps ... i mean why was suzie so scared of him ? she 's not that way . i think he did something ...	yeah , he got her busted for possession ...
i do n't know ... i think it was something else ... suzie says the bust was bullshit ...	and you believe her ?
i do n't know . i want to see you ...	kelly ... relax . take one of your mom 's valium or something . in another week you get on the plane . it 's over . we 're rich .
so if they 're tapping your phone , we 're dead . stay in the guest house . skip the graduation parties . you 'll never see duquette . okay ? i love you .	okay . i love you too .
that never seemed to worry you at the glades .	that 's not your line .
say you love me .	i love you . now give me the line .
i 'm running away .	you think that 's wise ?
but check this ...	ken . i 'm in some trouble . i need an attorney and you 're the only one i know . so i figured i 'd start here .
good thinking .	you can tie whoever did it to sandra van ryan ...
forget it .	lady has some deep pockets . that 's all i 'm saying .
ca n't you take that stupid thing off ?	not in here . chiropractor comes in here for lunch sometimes .
you 're not in bad shape , really . i know you think you are , but you 're not . let me tell you why . sandra van ryan .	what 's that supposed to mean ?
nellie gail ranch ...	sound nice ? it 's a fucking drug rehab farm . it 's where kelly van ryan went when her morn fished her out of the swamp . meanwhile , you get educator of the year i mean there 's no way they can put this thing in front of a jury . shit , they have n't even taken your statement yet . reason ? they 're still shoveling dirt and my guess is , they 're coming up empty . now tell me i 'm right .
there 's nothing for them to get .	good . so what we 're going to do is march right to hunter 's doorstep . we 're going to insist they take a statement . we 're going to tell them to charge your ass or get off your back . they 're walking a fine line here . defamation of character , malicious prosecution ...
i just want my life back ...	fair enough . let 's go make a statement .
come on , let loose !	i was just thinking about where i 'm gon na stay . i lost the house . it 's like waking up from a goddamn nightmare .
you 'll get over it . we 've got a knockdown , airtight , motherfucker of a lawsuit against sandra van ryan .	just like that ?
you 're saying that kelly was raped by sam lombardo .	that 's right .
who is it ?	detective duquette , ms. van ryan . let me in . now .
where is she ?	where she lives . in the guest house . now will you tell me what this is about ?
i 'm placing your daughter under arrest .	you ca n't ...
meet my partner , gloria perez .	i did . at blue balls .
it 's celine . he 's okay . he had a pretty good line on what cheap fucks people are .	so suzie , you called us , remember ?
no .	will they ?
it does n't look like it .	then he 'll be back at blue balls ?
you ought to watch it with that shit , suzie . you get busted again , you go back in a two-tine loser .	you got something against cigarettes ?
yeah , they 're bad for your health . i 'm tryin ' to look out for you ...	that 's cop bullshit .
well , you 're half right . best thing you could do for yourself right now would be to talk to me .	about what ?
every triangle i 've ever seen never lasts . somebody 's got to go .	is this supposed to mean something to me ? what triangle ?
you , kelly , sam .	i do n't have to listen to this . and you ca n't shove me around . i have friends now ...
is that what you think ? you have friends ? is that what they told you ?	i do n't mean who you 're thinking . i have other friends ...
get away from me .	do n't you see what this means ? you really think sam and kelly are gon na give you a third of the money ? you , the pill-head with the rap sheet ?
davy .	that 's right . that was his name .
you ... i should 've killed you myself . should never have left it up to him ...	shoulda , coulda , woulda ... get him in the water .
sam , for godsake .	hey , ray . guess whose name is on the numbered bank account besides yours and sam 's ?
why do n't you tell us one more time , how kelly came to be with you , alone in your house .	story 's the same , detective ...
i had to go look for this coupon .	the one you bought at school .
like i said , i had n't really expected to use it . anyway , i 'm going through a drawer . i hear a car . i look out the window . i see nicole driving away . i leave my room , and there 's kelly .	in cutoffs , a wet t-shirt .
yes .	and she wanted to talk .
yes .	but you ca n't tell us what she wanted to talk about .
i could , but it 's confidential . look , the point is , we did n't talk . i told her this was not an appropriate time or place .	and she began to cry . and you put an arm around her .
but she ran away .	that 's right .
but you do admit to touching her , to putting your arm around her . is n't that against the rules ?	it is and i do n't . ordinarily ... but , i mean ... there 's this kid standing in front of you crying ...
fuck you . this is bullshit . i 'm outta here .	sit down , lombardo .
yeah , well , you fixed that . what the hell happened , anyway ?	the bitch shot me , is what happened .
hey , what did you want me to do , die ?	well , shit , you 're the cop , they do n't teach you to disarm people , shoot them in the leg or something ? you were n't supposed to kill her for christ 's sake .
did you become squeamish about these things before or after you bludgeoned little suzie toller to death with a wine bottle ? jesus , man . it could n't have worked out better . they 're convinced kelly whacked suzie . i ca n't talk 'em out of it . we should be celebrating . this thing worked out just like you said , only better .	kelly was supposed to be framed , not killed . what i 'm telling you is , i do n't like surprises .
you mean this thing ?	yes , we call it a winch . and these are shrouds , and these are stays .
i thought this was supposed to be a vacation . why did n't you buy a nice big power boat ?	come on , man . i 'll make a sailor out of you yet .
jesus , man ... you okay ?	that how you planned it ? you take cut suzie , get me to hang it on kelly , then dump me in the ocean ...
how much is about six and a half million divided by three ?	jesus . two million one hundred thirty-three thousand three hundred thirty-three and change .
sam ...	put kelly on too .
but i..	shut up . do n't fall apart . the only people who can blow this is us . remember ?
yeah , right .	good . just keep telling yourselves that , the only people who can fuck this up is us .
i was worried about you , suzie . i decided we should all get together , one more time , before we split up .	are you mad at me ?
that was about as grim as it gets .	the guy was history when he killed kelly . you knew that .
but then you knew what he was like all along ... maybe his killing kelly was a thing you had counted on ...	but then it is better this way , do n't you think ? no loose ends .
what ?	that was the same thing ray said .
what 's wrong ?	fuck the winch . i wan na drive .
seems to like some of the same places you do . funny you never met .	yeah , real funny . you 're wrong about this , i could get busted on the spot .
i 've seen you out there in your old air boat , thinking about what might have been , old man van ryan had n't fucked you out of it . what if i told you i had a way we could get a big piece of it back ?	we ?
how ...	walter . he 's been aimin ' that brownie through knotholes for years . i saw these , i knew he 'd finally struck gold . i ca n't decide which came out better , that little straw kelly 's got up her nose , or that vibrator you 've got up her ass . what do you think , mr. lombardo ?
what ? you 're going to drive off without even saying hi ?	hi , sandy .
why do n't you come in , have a drink ?	ca n't . got a passenger .
i ca n't , sandy . i 've got to run .	i 'll bet . look , sam . why do n't you come by this weekend . we 'll take the boat out ...
sorry , sandy . i 've got plans .	what ? running over alligators with that silly swamp jalopy when you could be sailing a real boat ...
sandy ... what 's up ?	listen , kelly skipped school . have you talked to her ?
no .	shit . here we go again .
did n't you see her this morning ?	to tell you the truth , i have n't seen her since friday .
look . i know you 're seeing barbara baxter . so what ?	so maybe i 'm a one-woman man .
grab a clue , sam . you 're a hired hand around here . enjoy it while it lasts .	goodbye , sandra .
j. s. bach .	jim west .
artemus gordon . bach , he 's the composer .	i do n't mind him , but who the hell are you ... my valet or something ?
valet ? you jest of course . i am a u.s. marshal .	funny . so am i .
congratulations . unfortunately , my train is about to leave , and i really must insist you disembark .	your train ? listen , friend , you 're obviously lost . ... i 've got orders here to take possession of this train and to investigate a certain crime .
just another bureaucratic foul-up . you know how these pencil-pushers are . so , why do n't you just run on back and explain what happened ?	funny , i was just thinking you should do the same . since i am already in residence , and am obviously the man for the job , it 's been grand making your acquaintance , sir . and best of luck in all your future endeavors .
you 're quite the wordsmith , fiddle boy . but nobody smooth-talks his way into my assignment .	if you 're implying our little imbroglio has reached an impasse whose only resolution can be found in a more primitive fashion , then i for one am fully prepared to do so ... al fresco .
but do n't pull that again .	would n't dream of it .
eight scientists . eight different fields of endeavor . hydraulics , optics , ballistics ...	put them all together and what do we have ?
a giant ... hydraulically operated microscope ... that explodes ? or maybe just someone who hates scientists .	then why kidnap them ? why not just kill them ?
sorry . did n't mean that . just a little device of mine ...	wait a minute . now i know where i 've heard of you . you 're the gadget guy .
attractive buttons , yes ? but yank one off , toss it , and poof ! it emits a cloud of sleeping gas .	you need that real often ?
always hoping . or this ...	no offense , but all i ever need ... are these ... and this .
good lord , man . the world is changing . and mark me , it is always the criminal mind that is the first to exploit modern invention . we , as defenders of the right , must keep pace !	all right , if it 'll make you happy , i 'll try that .
your little jack-in-the-box gun . that might be useful .	well ... it 's the only one i have . it 's gotten me out of quite a few tight spots ...
that should put us ahead of the criminals .	i 'll work on it .
aha !	aha ?
yes , aha . a brass screw .	is this leading somewhere ?
potentially . this is the painstaking process of piecing together clues . the cornerstone of the modern science of criminology . piece by piece we reconstruct the identity of the villain .	starting with a screw ?
yes . starting with a screw . now , it 's not fair of me to expect someone who 's spent his life wrangling with western desperadoes to fully appreciate what i 'm doing here , but ...	what about the explosive ?
limestone quarry ?	limestone quarry , southern mansion . easy to get them mixed up ... i say we invite ourselves to the party .
doyle , once around the park . i need a moment to prepare .	prepare what ?
come llewellyn , do n't tarry .	call me that again , and you 're going to find a boot where it does n't belong .
that 's a lot of butler .	quite . come , let 's mingle .
doctor v. l. pemberton . i knew it . he 's a scientist all right . inventor of the pemberton condensed steam engine . i 'm telling you , artemus , loveless is our man .	whoa , jim . maybe . but we ca n't arrest this little pillar of society on maybe .
all right . how about this ? we put a watch on this pemberton , somebody tries to grab him ...	then we 've got our proof . excellent . and where do we find this fortunate scientist ?
you know your morse code almost as well as i .	almost ?
you feeling all right ?	come on , jim . i 'm serious . dot ... dash . it 'll be our secret means of communication should we ever need it .
now , what was that ?	you 're either having a seizure or you just said `` hello . ''
what was all that back there ?	all what ?
all that jumping and kicking .	that ? oh , it 's a kind of chinese fighting ... i was sort of caught once with a lovely chinese girl out in san francisco . her big brothers were kind enough to teach it to me i 've got a book on it , if you 're interested .
garrison ... ? then the president was right . except it 's not a foreign power , it 's a bunch of die- hard rebels trying to make the south rise again .	and if they 've got dr. loveless building weapons like those flying bombs ... they just might do it .
could i just point out , this is a perfect example of the criminal mind exploiting modern invention .	i 'm going to hit you .
never seen a gun fire so fast !	it 's a repeating steam cannon !
at least i tried something .	hey , i tried the board .
damn it , this is ridiculous .	at least the thing 's not that fast . we just follow it . whenever it stops , we 're there , waiting .
jim , are you all right ?	no , i 'm not all right . they got away . and we ca n't even follow them . they can get off the tracks anywhere they want .
if you do n't mind my asking , were you always the way you are ?	what way is that ?
so ... spontaneous . all that leaping off buildings and chinese fighting and whatnot .	`` spontaneous . '' i like that . most people say something like `` hare- brained reckless son-of-a-bitch . ''
well ... that , too .	nothing much to it really . when i was younger i got into a pretty bad run-in with the wyler boys . i saw them coming . but i did n't act fast enough . second-guessed myself . and it cost me ... cost me dearly .
so ... what happened ?	those kids , they took my wagon . never got it back .
uh ... how long ago was this ?	i was six . and ever since , my policy is : act first and worry later .
you might have mentioned you had that .	i thought all you needed were your fists and your gun .
strange ... you 'd think he 'd have this place better guarded .	i find most criminals slip up somewhere ...
they 're so precious when they 're asleep .	you really enjoy yourself , do n't you ?
can you fill me in here ?	sure . we have no idea what 's going on .
thank you .	come on , let 's at least see if we can find dr. pemberton .
know what this is ?	sure . it 's a wind-up ... thing .
this is good .	shhh ! come on . tell us something !
oh , damn ! that 's it .	it 's better than nothing .
it is ?	he 's going to put on a pith helmet and kill some guy named willard .
no record of him .	you 'd think if loveless is going to kill him he could at least be a prominent citizen .
what 's this ?	sounds like a train . looks like a train .
willard ...	it 's not a guy ...
got to be somewhere that 's hot . he said it was `` damnably hot . ''	that rules out willard , vermont ; willard , minnesota ... willard , new mexico ?
damn , i wish this thing would go faster .	relax . we 're almost there .
what is that ?	this ? i 'm testing a new spirit gum , to see how it holds .
and people are actually fooled by that ?	my disguises have helped me solve many a difficult case . i spent three years on the stage , you know . remind me sometime to regale you with my lear .
not again .	i adjusted it .
so the idea is if a guy punches me , he really hurts his hand ?	you said it popped out too easily . nothing 's ever good enough for you , is it ?
when we find him , he is mine .	oh , no , we split him fifty-fifty .
what if these tracks are just leading us to an indian village or some old coot 's mining claim ?	not likely . there must be tracks of twenty different wagons . freight wagons , carriages , buckboards ...
excellent detective work , sir . you should have the honor of going first .	oh , thank you .
artemus , you ready for this ? his next target is albuquerque .	what ? president grant is ... !
i know ! i know !	i do n't have to tell you what that would do to our careers !
we 've got to stop him right here , now ! with that armored steam engine of his it 'll be a slaughter .	i 'd love to stop him , but have you noticed the hundred armed men ?
there 's only seventy-eight .	oh , well , then let 's kick some ass !
it was in your book .	well , hell , maybe we do have a chance .
are those just button buttons or ... ?	of course not .
my hat is off to you , sir .	thank you .
god in heaven , what is that ? !	that 's ... that 's the criminal mind about to stomp our sorry butts !
my god ! he 's so excessive !	where have you been ?
pull the balloon right in front of him ! we 'll board the damn thing !	oh , i see , an easy plan !
the machine was stopped ! it seemed like a perfect time to disable it ! why 'd you have to throw it into full throttle ? !	he was going to shoot me ! do you mind ? !
all right , all right ... it 'll be okay . i mean , eventually it 'll just run out of steam .	in the next two minutes ?
artemus ! look at that . brand spanking new . she 's a beauty , huh ? let 's get rolling .	what is this ? a whole new train ?
well , we 'll stay in touch ... you know .	i 'm sure we will .
terribly sorry . i 'm always sticking this where it does n't belong . federal agents , ma'am . we 're rescuing a kidnap victim ...	yes , me !
you did n't tell us you had this on !	my lord , he was telling the truth !
he calls it the tarantula .	but it only has six legs .
he 's not giving up ?	well , see , he had this little wagon when he was a kid ...
time for you to get off , ma'am .	like hell ! i 'll see it through ! ram the bastard !
a new friend ?	we 'll see .
anyone ?	here . mr. tyler . he claims a certain skill at handling firearms .
i could get used to this , looking down on people .	they do n't even realize they should be frightened .
my name 's tyler . frank tyler . pleased to meet you , ma'am .	i get that feeling . you know , mr. tyler , i 'm the kind of woman who does n't believe men are much more than a complete waste of time . but after spying you across the room , i 'm tempted to suspend my disbelief , at least for the evening .
you know , ma'am , you remind me of a pearl-handled pistol i once owned . a beautiful thing to look at , but too hot to handle .	i do n't recollect ever being compared to a pistol before .
please do . i 'm a man who appreciates a good firearm .	really ?
well , where i come from it kind of goes with the territory . texas .	my ... the wild west .
well , sir , you are proving to be one of my more interesting guests .	your guests , ma'am ?
oh , do n't worry . i 've already overlooked the fact your name 's not actually on our guest list .	well , i owe you one , do n't i ?
you must excuse the doctor . no one has ever beaten him at his little game .	i do n't like to lose , either .
have you taken a wrong turn , mr. tyler ?	you tell me .
i 'm not so sure dr. loveless would like to find his social secretary dancing in the dark with an uninvited stranger .	forgive me , but you do n't strike me as the social secretary type .
thank you . but the truth is , i 'm a single woman in a man 's world . that leaves me very few choices , does n't it ?	i suppose so . but life can be hard for a man , too .
just a little insurance ... against the unexpected .	would that include me ?
you 've ... done ... this ... before .	i 've had some practice .
she 's perfectly safe .	really ? like general garrison or did n't you hear all that shooting ?
my . it 's gotten longer .	you bring the best out in a man .
you know , i really hate being toyed with before someone shoots me .	fine , i 'll stop .
look , i 'm captain james west ...	well , captain , then the answer is your train is still here .
your private train , sir .	private train ?
doyle 's the name , sir . of the connemara doyles . and there 's not a man riding the rails who holds a candle to meself . that having been said , sir , you 're five minutes late so let 's be on our way ! your friend 's already aboard .	my friend ?
would you be thinking ... ramming speed , sir ?	i would , mr. doyle ! are you game ?
do n't try to bamboozle me , colonel . has another scientist been kidnapped or not ?	well , yes sir . a professor morton , but with just a little more time , sir , i can assure you a breakthrough on this case ...
listen , in two days i 'm embarking on a tour of the western territories . and i want to know at least one problem is being handled competently in my absence .	of course , sir , that 's why i 've assigned a new man . and he 's no ordinary marshal . he 's quite sophisticated . three college degrees . a master of disguise . speaks french ...
french ?	yes sir .
why surely , mr. president , there must be some mistake . i mean ...	a mistake ? to assign this case to the man who blew up all the bridges on the chattanooga river and single- handedly trapped jackson 's entire cavalry ? how is that a mistake ?
mr. president , good to see you again , sir . sorry about all that .	that 'll be all , boys .
good work . really .	this is colonel richards .
but what would anyone have to gain from all this ... ? unless it were a foreign power .	exactly . any number of nations would love to cripple our scientific growth . and what better way to tip the scales in their favor than by killing off the greatest minds this country has produced .
we find ourselves at the dawn of the golden age of science . and it is the god-given destiny of this glorious nation to carry the torch that lights the way !	nicely said , sir .
goddamnit ! what am i doing ? what 's happened to all my cigars ? colonel richards here has had a dozen agents on these cases for over a year . no arrests , no leads , no clues ...	and ?
... well , of course you can . mr. president , what a surprise . what brings you here ?	on my way to denver ...
where 'd he say he was going to do this ?	he did n't . that 's your job . i 'm taking you off that other case until you 've nabbed this lunatic . good luck . nice train . but mine 's nicer .
i admire a man with a sense of humor .	when you 're three and a half feet tall , sir , life turns you into a comedian whether you like it or not ... . come with me , wo n't you ?
i must compliment you on miss thompson ... an exceptionally charming assistant .	thank you . i confess to a preoccupation with acquiring precisely that which the world says i can not have .
very good , sir ! i think my guest might be a sharpshooter by trade .	no , sir ... just a businessman .
really ? must be a dangerous business .	i deal with some tough customers .
sir ... i believe you have only two barrels .	how embarrassing . did i hold up three fingers ?
why do n't we just cut this routine short ? whatever you do to us , we 're not going to talk .	talk ? about what ... ? oh ! about who you are and all that ?
... and do give me some room , voltaire . you 're breathing on my head ! i hate it when you breath on my head !	dr. loveless ?
you 're not that big .	restrain yourself , voltaire . he 's just the sort of coward who would shoot an unarmed giant .
still alive . hmm . i suppose that does n't bode well for poor bruno .	he had a pressing engagement .
you got that right . now get up . we 're walking out of here .	has it penetrated that adrenaline- addled skull that you are surrounded by seventy-eight of my loyal followers ? you are in my domain !
the u.s. is my jurisdiction .	exactly ! you are on foreign soil . you are a representative of the occupying forces . or have n't you checked a map lately ? !
these lands were taken by force from mexico in the illegal war of american aggression .	that would be ... the mexican war ?
i 've even printed my own currency .	`` emperor miguelito ... ? ''
the first .	well , your highness , what makes you think we 'll ever sign a treaty with you ?
because i am holding all the western territories hostage , mr. west ! a town a day will disappear ! willard was merely a test run , a stroll in the park . next , i level all of albuquerque ! yes , that 's right . only yesterday i learned what you undoubtedly already know : your own president will be there . what an added bonus ! the gods are shining on me ! after tomorrow every american citizen will rise up and demand i be given back my humble little empire !	so , i 'm the only one here who can tell the difference between an emperor and a murderer ?
easy now .	easy ? easy ? on just what grounds should i take it easy ! ?
dr. pemberton ?	yes !
got ta get the doctor someplace safe .	who were they ? what do they want with me ?
i only met him once , but that was enough . for such a little man he had quite an oversized opinion of himself . he offered me the `` rare and unparalleled opportunity '' to develop a new steam engine for him . he claims to have some sort of factory in texas , i believe . said i could have the run of the place . he had all sorts of specifications . but when i questioned him closely , it became obvious he was just another mercenary businessman . both he and his partner had no real love of steam . it 's sad . so few men do .	who was this partner of his ?
a southern gentlemen . i do n't recall his name . i suppose it 's unkind of me to say it , but he had the most disconcerting glass eye .	a glass eye ? that 's who it was ! one-eyed jack garrison . otherwise known as general garrison , confederate third army . i saw him at dr. loveless ' party , but i could n't place him . he used to wear an eye-patch .
are you all right ?	for the moment . but i fear not for long . i 'm of no use to him now .
he ... he 's planning to kill us , is n't he ?	he 's just full of plans that are n't gon na work out .
this is something .	it 's a smelting retort .
now it 's a bomb .	it is ?
i beg your pardon ?	you do n't know what he 's built ? ! surely you do n't think he kidnapped all those geniuses to have them make something as rudimentary as this .
well ?	they 're coming .
when are they coming ?	they 're rounding up a posse . figure an hour ?
hey ... !	you 're not going to use it , are you ?
well , come on , that 's half a dozen armed men ...	right .
we 're going into battle , little one . find a woman to take care of it .	he thought you were a woman , airk !
madmartigan ! what did you do this time ?	nothing you would n't have done it my place !
i always knew you 'd end up in a crow 's cage .	least i 'm not down there herding sheep !
airk ! come on , airk . lem me outa here .	hey , remember ? you do n't need my help , madmartigan . little rabbit trap like this ? come on ! i could open it for you , but i would n't wan na insult you !
you left me to die , friend .	you managed alright .
it 's you they 're after , madmarti- gan . what did you do this time ?	they 're not after me . they want the baby .
you gon na be a hero , madmartigan ? i 've lost half my men fighting kael , and bavmorda , and the nock- maar army . now you and this peck , and that magpie up in the rafters , are gon na take 'em on alone ?	then come with us .
you 're chasing a dream .	just get me some horses .
out for a little ride in the coun- try , airk ?	thought you might get lonely , mad- martigan !
thank you , friend .	let 's go .
willow ufgood .	yes ... ?
you mean , you know who this baby belongs to ?	she belongs to all of us . she is the future queen and ruler of all kingdoms on earth .
no , willow . your journey has just begun . it has been foretold that this child shall bring about the downfall of queen bavmorda , whose evil powers have darkened our world . upon you depends this princess 's life .	me ?
you are the guardian , willow . you must take her to tir asleen .	what is tir asleen ?
the way has been lost in time . but there is one person , a druid sor- ceress , who might guide you there . she was exiled by queen bavmorda many years ago . her name is fin raziel .	you need a warrior for this job . i 'm nobody .
you are very important , willow .	no i 'm not . have you really looked at me ? i 'm short ! even for a nelwyn !
why ca n't you do it ? you have mag- ical powers .	my prsence can not extend beyond this forest . but i can give you these ...
they look like acorns .	anything you hurl them at will turn to stone .
sir ! i have to talk to you .	not today , willow .
earlier today you tried to tell me something , willow .	my family found this baby in the river , high aldwin .
now , you know where you 're going ? down there , through those trees , follow the river . you 'll know the crossroads by a big daikini struc- ture . willow , this is serious business . do n't waste any time , the outer world is no place for a nelwyn . give the baby to the first daikini you see , then hurry home as fast as you can .	if i 'm not strong enough to be your apprentice , how can i do this ?
you 're strong enough . but you 're going to need courage , willow .	i do n't want courage . i do n't want to be a warrior . all i 've ever wanted was to do magic , real magic , like you !
go in the direction the bird is flying .	oh , if i could do that i 'd -- i 'd turn burglekutt into a toad !
you ! are you the mother of that child ?	no . i mean yes .
i ca n't .	let me see it .
i ca n't .	why not ?
gawd ... you 're ... beautiful ...	you 're not a woman .
mmmm , i love the smell of a woman .	my step-father 's going to tear you apart .
i do what i 'm told .	too bad you 're not more like your father .
you 're a fool . now put her back .	i 'm not going to let this baby die .
why did you say that ?	say what ?
because it 's true .	i do n't believe you .
sorsha .	madmartigan .
we 'll probably die here , sorsha .	i have no family .
willow , why do n't you use your mag- ic to get us out of here ?	he 's no magician .
then you get us out of here .	i will ! but i need help !
who is that girl , anyway ?	sorsha , queen bavmorda 's daughter .
we 're a tiny version of all that ?	as above , so below .
bavmorda can not transform you . i 've protected this camp with a spell .	can you use your magic to get our men into the fortress , raziel ?
please ? i 'm dyin ' of thirst in here .	good . how long will it take ?
do n't make me angry , peck .	you be careful . i 'm a powerful sorcerer . i could turn you into a toad just like that .
do any other daikinis ever come by here ?	why .
hey ! somebody 's coming !	peck ! quick ! douse the fire !
thanks for your help , peck .	are you okay ?
as if you care . i saved your life , peck . those guys woulda killed us ! you wan na give your baby to them ? ? they eat babies !	i do n't know .
you a woodcutter ?	farmer .
you all right ?	these burns . my arms . ouch ...
smells like a battle .	are you a warrior ?
what 's that ? i hear something !	you hear trouble .
i 'll be around long after you 're dead , airk ! you slime ! when i get outa here i 'll cut your head off and stick it on a pig-pole !	friend of yours ?
whatcha thinkin ' about , willow ?	i hate this .
nobody 's gon na take your baby . know why ? nobody cares ... except me . you wan na go back to your farm . you wan na go back to your family . i could take care of that baby . i 'll look after her like she was me own .	you do n't know anything about ba- bies .
you got ta promise to feed her .	i will .
fresh goat 's milk .	absolutely !
and give her a bath everyday , and do n't let her get cold . and keep her diaper changed .	of course ! i promise !
here are her diaper rags . and this is her milk bladder . and when she cries -- she 's either hungry or she 's tired -- rock her on your left shoulder . she likes that .	do n't worry , willow . she 's in good hands . you have n't made a mistake .
you ! !	where the hell did you come from ?
hey ! give me that baby !	these pecks make terrible nurse- maids .
time to change her diaper .	time to leave .
because she 's sick .	because she 's sick .
where 's the baby ? ?	i thought you had her !
now willow , i know you 're gon na blame me for this but it was n't my fault ... !	elora danan !
when i left the crossroads , i got ambushed by an elf !	madmartigan ! you saved her life !
so you 're on your way to tir asleen , huh ? i hate to tell you this , willow , but tir asleen dos n't exist .	yes it does . the fairy queen told me .
madmartigan , i need your help .	my help ? a great magician like you ? you do n't need any help .
i was in love once , willow . she had a hold on my heart . i could barely function . i *was* a great swordsman ! i was knighted ! i could have been king !	you ?
i 'll help you ... !	i wo n't .
i 'm beginning to think you two *deserve* to be locked up .	the universe is a living creature , like you and me , madmartigan .
did she ask about me ?	who ?
she said lots of thing.s	willow !
she asked about you , madmartigan .	well what did she say ?
she 's in love .	you 're crazy . i think you 're in love .
you ?	what are you gon na become , raziel ? queen of the rodents ?
madmartigan ! i ca n't stand being in closed-in places .	want me to carry elora ?
willow ... this may be a bad time to ask this question but ... what if raziel 's wrong ?	she ca n't be wrong . she 's a very very very powerful sorceress .
she 's a bird , willow .	that 's my fault , not hers . i 've got to keep practicing . i 'm still in the learning stage but magic , madmartigan , requires concentration and --
watch it !	ahhh !
i have an idea . back in my village we catch a lot of hedgehogs .	willow , this is war , not agricul- ture !
i do n't know , willow .	madmartigan , you promised me you 'd take care of elora danan like your own daughter . she is all that matters . are you going to abandon her ?
it 's not a nelwyn baby .	no , it 's too big to be a nelwyn baby . it looks like a daikini ...
ca n't we keep it , dada ?	absolutely not .
dada , what 's a daikini ?	daikinis are giant people who live far far away .
i could be you rguard ! i could carry your spear !	what a great son you are , ranon . i wish i could take you with me . now go to sleep ...
who are you ! who are you !	i 'm willow ufgood . i 'm here to find fin raziel .
what do you want !	we need your help . to take this baby to tir asleen . she 's a prin- cess .
kill him !	no !
did *you* give that acorn its power ?	no .
you must learn magic .	that 's all i ever wanted !
willow . to learn magic , first you must make your own philosopher 's stone !	what do i need for that ?
i hope she 's all right . how much more do i have to do of this ?	till it 's in a powder . the energy exits within you ...
i know , and the magician 's goal is to find his true self . but what 's this got to do with it ?	as below , so above . you hold the univers , willow , in your hand .
i 'm all finished . now what ?	burn it to a fine ash .
how am i gon na do that ?	patience . concentrate . you will find a way .
we do n't have much time left ! go on ! go on !	i must concetrate my imagination ... to creat a new ... reality !
what 's the magician 's weapon ?	the limitless power of ...
your will ! your will ! what else could it be ?	i ca n't remember all these things . what am i learning ?
but what am i gon na transform ? ?	me !
oooh , this smells terrible .	that 's the life spark . exxence of magic and sorcery !
ouch ! !	shhhhh !
what 'd you bit me for ! !	we need blood . to nourish the stone . charge the stone with ener- gy .
again : what is the magician 's weapon ?	his will .
i just wanted to test it first .	no ! change me back into a sor- ceress , willow .
tir asleen .	there 's nobody here .
how ? ?	use the philosopher 's stone ! hur- ry ! invocation ! release them !
i did it ! madmartigan ! come here ! look ! you got ta see this ! i did it !	more ! more !
raziel ! i transformed them all ! i 'm a magician !	you did n't transform them , willow , you released them . that was noth- ing . now change me .
get down ! the ritual chant ! quick ! protect yourself !	why ?
i 've come all this way and now elora dana 's going to die !	no ! i can still defeat bavmorda !
time is running out .	surrender ! !
patience , willow .	courage , willow .
elves ! they 're always tormenting babies . they make them cry and take their tears .	somebody has to do it .
watch this . right between the eyes .	he never misses .
i 'm not going in there .	me neither !
are you sure ?	yes ! raziel ! she lives out on that island !
we got ta follow them .	us ? ? we 'll never catch them . any- way , we 're all done , teemo . let 's go home .
get back here , rool !	ouch ! let go of me !
if you rest the baby on your shoulder , she 'll stop crying .	shut up .
she needs to be changed .	i changed her already !
she needs to be changed again . sorsha crosses her arms in a hugg and watches as willow changes the baby . soon the baby stops crying . re- lieved yet still anxious , sorsha paces to a mirror . willow rocks the baby gently , absently looking at the fire . then his eyes focus on the fire .	who is that horrible friend of yours ?
madmartigan .	who is he ?
she 's hungry .	i know she 's hungry . i tried to feed her but she would n't eat a thing . i 'm not a wet nurse .
we are emissaries of her majesty , queen cherlindrea , of the land of coshairm .	queen cherlindrea ?
she requests the presence of your- self and the young princess .	who ? ?
i 'm getting her out of there !	no ! you let us handle this . come along , rool !
ohhh , i hate this .	take your time . do n't worry about the elves . they wo n't come out here .
this is not going well .	hurry ! queen cherlindrea will know what to do .
talk ! say something !	i ca n't see anything -- she 's too bright !
hey , careful there !	how do these work i wonder ? i got- ta save one to show the high aldwin .
its branches are supposed to be made of gold , solid gold .	how are we going to get out there ?
we 've traveled a long way . we 're looking for fin raziel .	the sorceress .
obviously .	without raziel we 'll never find tir asleen . we 'd better go .
this ca n't be right . this is n't a sorceress . this is some kind of animal .	queen bavmorda transformed her .
sure , i 'm sorry . hope you do n't mind me plugging in to your battery . mine 's dead ... how can i help ? what can i do ?	maybe milking .
milking ?	cows . you know , cows ?
i 've seen pictures .	good , you start tomorrow .
did n't you hear me , book ? pull ! you never had your hands on a teat before ?	not one this big .
eat up , book . what 's the matter with your appetite ?	guess i 'm not used to so much .
how could you do this to me tonight ? i told you i had company	sorry . it 's important .
where 's timmy and buck ?	upstairs , asleep . where 'd you think ?
you 've got a man here and the kids are upstairs ?	that 's none of your goddamn business ! so keep your goddamn holier-than- thou mouth shut ! anyway , they like fred .
who are these orphans , anyway ?	they 're amish .
put my car in the garage and close the door .	john , i do n't understand any of this .
you do n't know anything ... borrowed your car . did n't say why . and you never heard of that woman and her boy .	john , why ? ...
good morning . book , is it ? you are the yankee they talk about ?	i thought i was the english .
i came to see rachel lapp .	try the house .
eli says you 're a carpenter , book .	it 's been a while .
your hole is healed , then ?	pretty much .
nail it !	yes , sir .
everything is all right , john .	pick up the hat .
i saw him .	who 'd you see ?
who 'd you see , sam ? the man on the floor ?	no ... i saw the man who killed him .
he was ... like him .	black ... i understand . what else , sam ?
you ever handle a pistol like this , samuel ?	no pistol . ever .
tell you what i 'm going to let you handle this one . but only if you promise not to say anything to your momma . i 've got a feeling she would n't understand .	okay , mr. book .
that 's luke . he does n't like strangers .	you do n't say .
hey , sam ...	... i want to say a thing .
is it them ?	it 's them , sam . now , sam , listen to me and listen to me carefully . listen to me as you never listened before .
are they going to kill you ?	listen to me , sam ! i want you to go across the new corn to stoltzfus ' . run as fast as you can . and stay there !
what are you going to do ?	i 'll be all right . you just do as i say .
do n't let them hurt you .	i wo n't . now run . fast as you can !
are you really ever coming back ?	got to , sam . you and i are going to a courthouse together , put some people behind bars .
have you got your gun on now ?	sure have , sam .
how reliable is this kid ?	oh , he 's good .
amish .	yeah .
what have you got ?	zenovitch was about to deliver a list of names tonight street chemists ... the guys processing this p2p into speed .
so one of them got to him .	maybe .
you know who ?	maybe .
you 're still convinced there 's a link to the department ?	if there is n't i 've just wasted the last six months .
that 's the problem . we need results . the press is driving us crazy over this p2p thing . calling us the 'speed capitol of the country ' . you know the sort of thing . it 's getting political . the commissioner 's getting very uneasy .	the amish boy saw him , paul . i 'll make it , but set donahue and the homicide department off my back or they 'll blow the whole thing .
when word gets out that zenovitch was a cop , all hell will break lose . you 've got 24 hours . that 's all i can give you . 24 hours on your own . after that the case and the witness go back to the homicide department .	tell you what ... why do n't you and that blonde what's-her-name come over for dinner sunday . how 'bout that .
what's-her-name moved to buffalo .	well , anyway , do n't get crazy . i 'll do something for zenovich 's wife .
last guy i would have figured . but he 's part of it .	i hope you do n't have any doubts about that .
if i did , i 'd have kept my mouth shut ... it fits , paul ... fifty-five gallons of p2p confiscated four years ago ... guess who was in on the collar ? mac . he salts it away somewhere ... he knows the stuff is potent , but the street chemists have n't figured out how to process it . but they do now . and now the stuff is worth five-grand a pint and there are a lot of pints in a fifty-five gallon drum .	who else knows ?
just us .	okay , what are you going to need to clean it up
more people ... got ta pick up where zenovich left off . people from outside the department .	maybe the bureau . or those bastards at treasury . i 'll take care of it . i hate this shit , johnny . you cut their balls off for me . i 'm counting on you .
what 's your first move ?	a hot shower ... i have n't changed clothes in two days .
who else knows ?	just us .
you made a mistake , paul . you should n't have taken elton out .	how bad did mac get you ? we figured pretty bad .
i 'm fine . i 'm going to live a long time . that 's what i called to tell you .	johnny
you might want to pass it along to mac .	listen to me , johnny . come in ! you 're out there all alone ... we 're getting close ... real close ... maybe if you listen to me for a minute we can work something out so you can come in
you 're going to have to do it right here , schaeffer .	do n't try me , johnny !
it 's all over , paul .	move ! or you die right here !
i 'm a police officer . i 'm going to have to talk to the boy . what 's his name ?	samuel . samuel lapp . but what happened here is none of his affair . my sister is expecting me ... our train is leaving soon .
where are you taking us ?	we 're looking for a suspect . we 've reason to believe he 's still in the area .
you have no right to keep us here .	yes i do . your son is a material witness to a homicide .
you do n't understand , we have nothing to do with your laws !	does n't surprise me . i meet a lot of people like that .
what was that ?	he wants to know who you are . your name . i told him we do n't need to know anything about you .
now what 's the problem ?	the problem is i do n't happen to think my son should be spending all his time with a man who carried a gun under his coat and goes around whacking people .
whacking ?	yes . and i also want to leave this city .
believe me , i 'm trying to get this over with as fast as i can . but samuel will probably have to come back and testify .	we do not go into your courts .
look , i 'm genuinely sorry ...	no you 're not you 're glad , because now you 've got a witness . i heard the other police talking last night . they do n't seem to like you very much .
they kid a lot .	i would not be too sure .
but not a good tired .	what 's a 'good ' tired . tired is tired .
your sister said you do n't have a family ?	no .
oh ? anything else ?	oh yes . she thinks you like policing because you think you 're right about everything . and you 're the only one who can do anything . and that when you drink a lot of beer you say things like none of the other police would know a crook from a ... um ... bag of elbows .
why do n't you arrest that man ? are you protecting him because policeman ?	listen , i 'm the cop that polices the police . i 'm not in the business of protecting crooked cops . i 'll make an arrest when i know everybody involved .
but why would they murder ...	because somehow they knew i was getting close . look , it 's narcotics ... they make dope out of chemicals ... they sell it on the street for millions of dollars . they 'll do anything . and they can get away with it because they 're cops .
i 'm afraid . i 'm afraid for samuel . i want to go home .	you 'll be safe . you do n't have to worry .
where are you taking us now ?	home .
you said we would be safe in philadelphia .	i was wrong .
stay for awhile . rest . i 'll make coffee and breakfast .	i ca n't .
but john ... why did n't you go to a hospital ?	no , no doctor ...
but why ?	gunshot ... they 'll file reports ... they 'll find me .
who are they ?	the leadership of our district ... the diener . bishop tschantz is the one with no hair on top . they decided to come and see you for themselves . except stoltzfus , of course . he came the first day . i think he saved your life .
does anybody know i 'm here ?	only the elders .
how long ?	what ?
how long have i been here ?	two days .
listen , thank you . thanks for everything . but i 've got to go .	but you ca n't .
tell him his tea stinks .	you tell him . when you 're able .
john book , i would appreciate it if , during the time you are with us , you would have as little to do with samuel as possible .	nobody meant any harm . the boy was curious . i unloaded the gun -
enjoying your reading ?	very interesting . i 'm learning a lot about manure . what 's that ?
your husband 's ?	yes . it 's good that someone can have the use of them . besides , in your clothes you 'd stand out to strangers .
i should tell you these do not have buttons . see ? hooks and eyes .	something wrong with buttons ?
buttons are hochmut .	hochmut ?
vain . proud . such a person is hochmutsnarr . he is not plain .	anything against zippers ?
you make fun of me . like the tourists . driving by all the time . some even come into the yard . very rude . they seem to think we are quaint .	quaint ? ca n't imagine why .
where 's the nearest telephone ?	telephone ? the gunthers across the valley . they 're mennonite . they have cars and refrigerators and telephones in the houses even .
well ... the store at saltzburg ... but you wo n't be going to saltzburg for a while .	i 'm going this morning .
but stoltzfus said ...	i know what he said .
the ... bullets ?	oh . the bullets .
eli is a fine carpenter . best in the district . he and his father built the big house themselves forty years ago .	oh ? what happened to hochstetler ?
we had some lemonade and he left .	a real fireball .
you know carpentry ?	i did some carpentry summers when i was going to school .
what else can you do ?	i can whack people . i 'm hell at whacking .
whacking is not of much use on a farm .	now hold on . there 's a lot of people who think being a cop is a legitimate job .
sure .	but ... you may not be well enough .
when will you be going ?	not long ... a few days .
won him over just like that .	i see . but i hope you have a lot of sugar . eli is ready to go to zook 's .
you should not bother with that birdhouse . if you 're leaving tomorrow .	i 'm leaving tonight . i 'm going to need my clothes . and my gun .
there was a time when i thought you might have stayed .	there was .
there was a time when i would have welcomed it .	i know .
i was being foolish ?	no . i was being unrealistic . even thinking about living this life .
you 're so sure of that ?	are n't you ? after today ?
i 'm not so sure of anything as you are , john book . you could live this life if you wanted to bad enough . just as i could live yours !	oh , come on , rachel . no way .
there is always a way ! but you are such a ... a glotzkopp you can not see ! you 'd rather go back to that city ! to nothing ! no woman ! no children ! no land !	land ! are you crazy ? i 'm no amishman and i 'm no farmer ! i 'm a cop . that 's what i know and that 's what i do !
what you do is take vengeance ! which is a sin against heaven !	that 's your way , not mine .
that 's god 's way !	well in the city of philadelphia , god needs a little help !
i want you to take this ... to remember by .	where 's my baggy pants ?
anybody know about this ?	i did n't even know about it .
i got there late , john .	let 's just find coalmine . listen , zenovich made a mistake . you did n't let anybody down . it happens
listen carefully , i wrote the amish woman 's name and address on my desk calendar , i want you to lose it for me , now . tonight .	what the hell are you talking about ? what 's happening .
nothing . i 'm not going to be around for a while . i 'll call you when i can .	johnny , what the fuck ?
yeah ... i can put it all together when i get back , 'til then , you know nothing , understand ? business as usual ...	i hear you .
it 's me .	johnny ! where the hell have you been ?
never mind . i 'm coming in to take care of business . how hot am i ?	too hot . do n't do it . do n't come in .
i 'm coming .	listen , johnny , do n't do anything stupid . you could n't get within a mile of schaeffer right now . so stay put ... stay in touch i 'll let you know when maybe it makes sense .
you hear me ?	i hear you . i 'll stay in touch .
where i 'm at is maybe 1890 .	say again ?
you know where he is .	wrong .
you 'd lie to protect him .	probably .
you admit you 're lying ?	i admit i do n't know where he is .
you 're the first one he 'll contact .	he 's got my number .
either you 're a member of the club or you are n't , elton . tell me what you know ...	what i know , paul , is ... he 's going to take you out ...
did you find him ?	not yet .
elaine , i 've come to apologize for lt. mcelroy . he overstated the department 's position .	he accused john of taking kickbacks . and you know anybody who knows john knows that 's a goddamn lie !
of course , elaine . but as long as there 's any question , better johnny should come back and clear his name .	better you should get off my front porch before i get my mace !
elaine , i do n't want to have to take you in for questioning . you 've got his car , you were the last to see him	i do n't know where he is .
everything okay ?	yes , thank you very much .
john said you 're amish .	yes .
good morning .	you did n't have to ...
i wanted to . you were kind to take us in last night . anyway , i needed something to do . i was so angry with your brother . he 's so ... agaanisish !	aganishish ? yeah , that sounds like john .
just a minute . i 'll pour you some coffee .	you 're not carrying a bullwhip ... how 'd you manage to put my kids to work ?
what 's so funny ?	fred . the way he looked when you screamed at him .
god , fred ...	at home you 'd never hear a woman scream at a man that way .
no ? why not ?	you just would n't . it 's not the amish way . but i think it would have done me good if i could have screamed at your brother last night .
who was that man ?	his name is john book .
is the english dead ?	no ...
that has no place in this house .	i know .
did n't you hear stoltzfus ? what if he dies ? then the sheriff will come . they 'll say we broke their laws	we 'll pray that he does n't die ! but if he does , then we 'll find a way so no one knows !
rachel , this is a man 's life , we hold it in our hands .	i know god help me , i know that , eli . but i tell you that if he 's found here , the people who did this to him will come for samuel .
eli , john is a carpenter . as well as being a fine policeman .	eh ? well then , maybe he can go to zook 's barn-raising , eh ? see how good a carpenter .
how can this be ? how can you do such a thing ? is this plain ? is this the ordnung ?	i have done nothing against the ordnung .
eh ? nothing ? rachel , you bring this man to our house . with his gun of the hand . you bring fear to this house . fear of english with guns coming after . you bring blood and whispers of more blood . now english music ... and you are dancing to english music ! and you call this nothing ?	i have committed no sin .
no sin ? maybe . not yet . but , rachel , it does not look ... do n't you know there has been talk ? talk about you , not him . talk about going to the bishop . about having you ... shunned !	that is idle talk .
i am not a child .	you are acting like one !
i will be the judge of that .	no ! they will be the judge of that ! and so will i ... if you shame me !
no , rachel ...	i have to help him !

well , dorothy was walking along the --	i saw you tinkering with that contraption , hickory . now , you and hunk get back to that wagon !
all right , mrs. gale . but some day they 're going to erect a statue to me in this town , and --	well , do n't start posing for it now . here , here -- ca n't work on an empty stomach . have some crullers .
as mayor of the munchkin city in the county of the land of oz i welcome you most regally	but we 've got to verify it legally to see ...
to see ?	if she ...
if she ?	is morally , ethic'ly
then this is a day of independence for all the munchkins and their descendants !	if any !
from now on you 'll be history	you 'll be hist ...
our echo .	tap - tap - tap - tap - what was that - that - that ? our echo - echo - echo .
oh , come on - come on ! we 'll soon find the wizard !	the wizard - the wizard - the great and powerful wizard of oz - oz - oz-oz - oz - oz - oz - oz !
... have you come back ?	please , sir . we 've done what you told us . we 've brought you the broomstick of the wicked witch of the west . we melted her .
... resourceful !	yes , sir . so we 'd like you to keep your promise to us , if you please , sir .
if you were really great and powerful , you 'd keep your promises !	do you presume to criticize the ... .
... -- oz -- has spoken !	who are you ?
well , i -- i -- i am the great and powerful -- wizard of oz .	you are ?
uhhhh -- yes ...	i do n't believe you !
yes-s-s -- that ... that 's exactly so . i 'm a humbug !	oh ... .
frightened ? you are talking to a man who has laughed in the face of death -- sneered at doom and chuckled at catastrophe . i was petrified . then suddenly the wind changed , and the balloon floated down into the heart of this noble city , where i was instantly acclaimed oz , the first wizard de luxe !	ohhh !
oh ! come back ! do n't go without me ! please come back !	i ca n't come back ! i do n't know how it works !
oh --	goodbye , folks !
oh ! oh , it feels like my joints are rusted . listen , dorothy , do n't let hunk kid you about miss gulch . she 's just a poor sour-faced old maid that -- she ai n't got no heart left . you know , you should have a little more heart yourself , and have pity on her .	well , gee , i try and have a heart .
now look , here 's something that really has a heart . this is the best invention i ever invented .	this ?
sure . it 's to break up winds , so we do n't have no more dust storms . can you imagine what it 'll mean to this section of the country ? i 'll show you . it works perfectly now . here 's the principle . you see that fan -- that sends up air currents into the sky . these air currents -- oh , stop it !	oh !
who did it ? now wait a minute .	hickory !
oh ! oh , zeke ! help ! help me , zeke ! get me out of here ! help !	are you all right , dorothy ?
... did n't you ?	no -- no ! it was an accident ! i did n't mean to kill anybody ! ... .
what are you going to do with my dog ? give him back to me !	all in good time , my little pretty -- all in good time .
oh , please give me back my dog !	certainly -- certainly -- when you give me those slippers .
but the good witch of the north told me not to .	very well ! throw that basket in the river and drown him !
no ! no -- no ! here -- you can have your old slippers -- but give me back toto .	that 's a good little girl . i knew you 'd see reason .
ahh ! ah !	i 'm sorry . i did n't do it ! can i still have my dog ?
run , toto , run !	catch him , you fool !
are you a good witch , or a bad witch ?	who , me ? why , i 'm not a witch at all . i 'm dorothy gale from kansas .
toto 's my dog .	well , i 'm a little muddled . the munchkins called me because a new witch has just dropped a house on the wicked witch of the east . and there 's the house , and here you are , and that 's all ...
the munchkins are happy because you have freed them from the wicked witch of the east .	oh . but , if you please -- what are munchkins ?
i thought you said she was dead .	that was her sister -- the wicked witch of the east . this is the wicked witch of the west . and she 's worse than the other one was .
pooh -- what a smell of sulphur ! i 'm afraid you 've made rather a bad enemy of the wicked witch of the west . the sooner you get out of oz altogether , the safer you 'll sleep , my dear .	oh , i 'd give anything to get out of oz altogether -- but which is the way back to kansas ? i ca n't go the way i came .
no -- that 's true . the only person who might know would be the great and wonderful wizard of oz himself !	the wizard of oz ? is he good or is he wicked ?
oh , very good , but very mysterious . he lives in the emerald city , and that 's a long journey from here . did you bring your broomstick with you ?	no , i 'm afraid i did n't .
well , then , you 'll have to walk . the munchkins will see you safely to the border of munchkinland . and remember , never let those ruby slippers off your feet for a moment , or you will be at the mercy of the wicked witch of the west .	but , how do i start for emerald city ?
oh , will you help me ? can you help me ?	you do n't need to be helped any longer . you 've always had the power to go back to kansas .
... toto , too ?	toto , too .
oh , now ?	whenever you wish .
are you ready now ?	yes . say goodbye , toto .
yes , i 'm ready now .	then close your eyes , and tap your heels together three times .
and think to yourself -- `` there 's no place like home ; there 's no place like home ; there 's no place like home . ''	there 's no place like home . there 's no place like home . there 's no place like home . there 's no place like home .
let 's see -- you 're -- you 're travelling in disguise . no , that 's not right . i -- you 're -- you 're going on a visit . no , i 'm wrong . that 's ... you 're -- running away .	how did you guess ?
professor marvel never guesses -- he knows ! now , why are you running away ?	why --
no , no -- now do n't tell me . they -- they do n't understand you at home . they do n't appreciate you . you want to see other lands -- big cities -- big mountains -- big oceans --	why , it 's just like you could read what was inside of me .
yes --	please , professor , why ca n't we go along with you ?
oh , yes - you - you wanted to go home , huh ?	oh , no , i wanted to go along with you .
oh --	nobody cares about me at home . they would n't even miss me .
aw , come , come , come --	no , they wo n't - honestly .
oh --	auntie em was even going to let them kill toto yesterday for biting miss gulch . oh , please , professor , why ca n't we go with you and see all the crowned heads of europe ?
that 's our farm !	oh -- yes .
... her face is careworn .	yes ... that 's aunt em .
that 's right . what 's she doing ?	well , i -- i ca n't quite see . why , she 's crying .
oh --	someone has hurt her -- someone has just about broken her heart .
i had the measles once -- and she stayed right by me every minute .	uh-huh .
... room --	has it poppies on the wall ... .
... paper ?	i said it had poppies on the wall paper ! eh -- she 's -- what 's this ? why , she 's -- she 's putting her hand on her heart -- she 's -- she 's dropping down on the ... .
... bed .	oh , no -- no !
that 's all -- the crystal 's gone dark .	oh , you ... .
... you do n't suppose she could really be sick , do you ? oh -- oh , i 've got to go home right away !	but -- what 's this ? i thought you were going along with me .
oh --	but you could n't have been , could you ?
that dog 's a menace to the community . i 'm taking him to the sheriff and make sure he 's destroyed .	destroyed ? toto ? oh , you ca n't ! you must n't ! auntie em ! uncle henry ! you wo n't let her , will you ?
now you 're seeing reason .	no --
here 's what i 'm taking him in -- so he ca n't attack me again .	oh , no , no ! i wo n't let you take him ! you go away , you ... . ! oooh , i 'll bite you myself !
here ! i 've got an order ! let me have ...	stop her !
oil can ... ..oil can ... .	did you say something ?
where do you want to be oiled first ?	my mouth -- my mouth !
... m ... m ... my , my , my , my goodness -- i can talk again ! oh -- oil my arms , please -- oil my elbows .	oh ...
oh --	... oh , did that hurt ?
no -- it feels wonderful . i 've held that axe up for ages . oh -- -	oh , goodness ! how did you ever get like this ?
... and right in the middle of a chop , i ... i rusted solid . and i 've been that way ever since .	well , you 're perfect now .
my ... my neck . my ... my neck . perfect ? oh -- bang on my chest if you think i 'm perfect . go ahead -- bang on it !	oh -- !
oh --	all hollow . oh --
oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , are you all right ?	i 'm afraid i 'm a little rusty yet .
oh , dear -- that was wonderful ! you know -- we were just wondering why you could n't come to emerald city with us to ask the wizard of oz for a heart .	emerald city ? why , that 's a long and dangerous journey . and it might rain on the way .
well , suppose the wizard would n't get me one when we got there ?	oh , but he will ! he must ! we 've come such a long way already .
oh ! they 're - they 're gone now .	oh , goodness ! did any of them sting you ?
i - i guess they tried to , but they bent their stingers .	oh , dear . i do n't know what i 'd do if a whole swarm kept -- oh ! oh ! oh , there 's one on me !
oh - i 'll get it !	oh ! oh !
oh --	oh , see - i killed it . oh , i killed that poor little honey bee !
and i was standing over there rusting for the longest time .	still , i wish i could remember . but , i guess it does n't matter anyway . we know each other now , do n't we ?
we might .	oh --
and bears !	what sort of an animal is that ?
and him a brain .	i 'm sure he could give you some courage .
ca n't that female take no for an answer ?	oh --
oh , he 's just ascared again .	do n't you know the wizard 's going to give you some courage ?
no . why only -- oh --	oh ! oh , tin man ! oh !
oh ! something bit me , too !	now come on - you 're acting silly --
dorothy !	i knew you would !
tomorrow ? oh , but i want to go home now .	you 've had plenty of time already !
ahh -- - oh , it ticks ! listen !	yes ... !
... yes .	look -- it ticks !
now i know i 've got a heart -- 'cause it 's breaking .	oh -- goodbye , lion . you know , i know it is n't right , but i 'm going to miss the way you used to holler for help before you found your courage .
oh , my !	lions and tigers and bears !
oh , my !	lions and tigers and bears !
oh , my !	lions and tigers and bears !
oh , my !	lions and tigers and bears !
what -- what did you do that for ? i did n't bite him .	no , but you tried to .
it 's bad enough picking on a straw man , but when you go around picking on poor little dogs --	well , you did n't have to go and hit me , did you ? is my nose bleeding ?
well , of course not . my goodness , what a fuss you 're making . well , naturally , when you go around picking on things weaker than you are -- why , you 're nothing but a great big coward !	you 're right -- i am a coward .
... has been simply unbearable .	oh .
a home --	the nerve .
it 's beautiful , is n't it ? just like i knew it would be . he really must be a wonderful wizard to live in a city like that !	well , come on , then . what are we waiting for ?
yes -- let 's run !	yes .
oh -- unusual weather we 're having , ai n't it ?	look ! he 's rusted again . oh , give me the oil can -- quick ! oh-oh , quick !
ho -- ho -- ho -- ho	hah !

oh , but -- but please . it 's very important .	and -- and i got a permanent just for the occasion .
i 'll be home in time for supper !	in another hour , i 'll be king of the forest . long live the king ! if ... .
your majesty , if you were king you would n't be afraid of anything ?	not nobody , not nohow !
how about a hippopotamus ?	why , i 'd thrash him from top to bottomamus !
supposin ' you met an elephant ?	i 'd wrap him up in cellophant !
i 'd be too scared to ask him for it .	oh , well , then -- we 'll ask him for you .
i 'd sooner wait outside .	but why ? why ?
because i 'm still scared !	oh , come on .
oh -- oh , come on .	huh ? what 'd he say ?
does it work ?	no , but it 's wonderful for threatening with .
that noise do n't come from no ordinary bird .	it may be just a cricket or a critter in the trees .
as monarch of the forest i do n't like the situation .	are you gon na stand around and let 'em fill us full of horror ?
oh -- oh -- oh ! toto -- toto !	did they hurtcha ?
they 're coming back !	ohhh !

well -- i would never 've found it if it had n't been for you .	i think i 'll miss you most of all .
now lookit , dorothy , you ai n't using your head about miss gulch . think you did n't have any brains at all .	i have so got brains .
well , why do n't you use them ? when you come home , do n't go by miss gulch 's place . then toto wo n't get in her garden , and you wo n't get in no trouble . see ?	oh , hunk , you just wo n't listen , that 's all .
why , zeke , -- you 're just as scared as i am !	what 's the matter -- gon na let a little old pig make a coward out of you ?
... do n't talk .	it 's pleasant down that way , too .
down ? no , you see , i 'm -- well , -- i 'm --	oh , well , here -- let me help you .
... yes .	ohhhh --

oh , no -- i just keep picking it up and putting it back in again .	ohhh --
... free !	oh ! oh ! ohhh !
did i scare you ?	no , no -- i -- i just thought you hurt yourself .
wonderful ! why , if our scarecrow back in kansas could do that , the crows 'd be scared to pieces !	they would ?
um-hmm .	where 's kansas ?
that 's where i live . and i want to get back there so badly i 'm going all the way to emerald city to get the wizard of oz to help me .	you 're going to see a wizard ?
um-hmm .	do you think if i went with you this wizard would give me some brains ?
i could n't say . but even if he did n't , you 'd be no worse off than you are now .	yes -- that 's true .
but maybe you 'd better not . i 've got a witch mad at me , and you might get into trouble .	witch ? huh ! i 'm not afraid of a witch ! i 'm not afraid of anything -- - except a lighted match .
i do n't blame you for that .	but i 'd face a whole box full of them for the chance of getting some brains . look -- i wo n't be any trouble , because i do n't eat a thing -- and i wo n't try to manage things , because i ca n't think . wo n't you take me with you ?
hooray ! we 're off to see a wizard !	oh -- well -- you 're not starting out very well .
oh , i 'll try ! really , i will .	to oz ?

oil can what ?	oil can ? oh -- oh , here it is !
he said his mouth .	here -- here --
the other side ... .	yes -- - there .
but you 've just been saying how much you want a heart .	and i 'll keep the oil-can handy .
... just that the witch is so wicked . i do n't think you two ought to come with me because you 'll get into trouble .	oh , you do n't think we 're going to stand by and let her get away with fireballs and bees , do you ?
oh , you 're the best friends anybody ever had ! and it 's funny , but i feel as if i 've known you all the time . but i could n't have , could i ?	i do n't see how . you were n't around when i was stuffed and sewn together , were you ?
i do n't like this forest ! it 's -- it 's dark and creepy !	of course , i do n't know , but i think it 'll get darker before it gets lighter .
oh , that 's too bad . do n't you think the wizard could help him , too ?	i do n't see why not . why do n't you come along with us ? we 're on our way to see the wizard now . to get him a heart .
... along .	oh , no -- please . i have to rest for just a minute . toto !

how can i ever thank you enough ?	well , you ca n't . as for you , my fine friend -- you 're a victim of disorganized thinking . you are under the unfortunate delusion that simply because you run away from danger , you have no courage . you 're confusing courage with wisdom . back where i come from , we have men who are called heroes . once a year , they take their fortitude out of mothballs and parade it down the main street of the city . and they have no more courage than you have . but ! they have one thing that you have n't got ! a medal ! therefore -- for meritorious ... .
as for you , my galvanized friend , you want a heart ! you do n't know how lucky you are not to have one . hearts will never be practical until they can be made unbreakable . i could have been a world figure , a power among men , a - a successful wizard , had i not been obstructed by a heart .	but i still want one .
stop that dog !	this is a highly irregular procedure ! this is absolutely unprecedented !
-- ruined my exit !	help !
you new ?	yes . viktor davidov , miss ... ?
doctor . jones . christmas jones . no jokes , ive heard them all .	dont know any doctor jokes .
what happened to len tashka ?	couldnt make it . splitting headache .
he is an impostor . theres no davidov at miratom .	heres your imposter . hes paid off the men on the plane outside . theyre not taking the bomb to any russian facility , theyre flying it wherever he tells them .
shame you had to spot i wasnt the real thing .	so who are you ?
they wont get far . every warhead has a locator card . a miratom device . emits a high-pitched signal on russian emergency frequencies . we can track the bomb .	with this ?
when this is over we should bury the hatchet . celebrate . a champagne dinner ?	when this is over our bodies may be blown to smithereens .
the plutonium is missing . theyve taken the core !	then its no longer a bomb ?
what the hell were you doing ? you nearly killed us !	i did kill us . she thinks were dead . and she thinks she got away with it .
what the hell are you talking about ?	its part of some plan . she dresses it up like a terrorist attack . the explosion covers up the theft of the plutonium .
whos she ?	elektra king .
elektra king ? are you insane ? this is her pipeline .	makes her look even more innocent .
what would she want with weapons grade plutonium ?	i was hoping you could tell me .
what is it ?	she just upped the stakes . all her chips are on the table now . and ms life is part of the bet .
nuclear .	not just nuclear . powered by a nuclear reactor . hes not loading any cargo . they want the sub . the sub itself . put weapons grade plutonium inside the subs reactor : instant , catastrophic meltdown .
but why ? eight million people would die , the land irradiated for a hundred years . a cloud of radiation the size of europe ...	because an explosion like that would kill all the other pipelines . there would be only one way to get the oil out of the caspian and pump it to the world ...
the king pipeline .	elektra would control it all .
zukovsky ...	if i dont get to the boa before he gets to maidens tower , m is dead .
is there another way ?	we go down to the torpedo bay .
hes sealed himself in .	hes going to insert the plutonium .
do you know what youre doing ?	like riding a bike .
what kind of bikes did you ride ?	just wanted to put him on edge ...
count to twenty . when you get to twenty open the hatch . it can only be opened for a few seconds or well sink .	but what if ...
weve got to get out .	we cant .
i love christmas in turkey .	so isnt it time you unwrapped your present ?
dislocated collar bone . if any more tendons snap ... it wont just be two weeks out of action .	i need you to pass me fit now , molly .
its just a scratch .	james . it wouldnt really be ...
then maybe id be ... open to that .	perhaps after this ... test ?
... yes ? ...	i could come for a second opinion ?
constructions not exactly my line .	quite the opposite , in fact .
old friend ?	since oxford . i knew him when he had nothing but a brilliant mind and enough guts to conquer the world . hes a man of great integrity .
elektra ? running king industries ? ive known that girl all her life . im not sure she knows what shes walking into .	shes not a girl anymore .
ive scheduled a medical for you .	its barely a scratch . the dome broke my fall .
007. what do you know of the caspian sea ?	caviar capital of the world . matchless beluga . firm , yet subtle . largest landlocked body of water on earth . oil-rich . hitler wanted it . stalin beat him to it .
who told you to look at elektras files ?	i took the initiative .
you havent been given an assignment in this case .	i was the one who brought that money in ...
im well aware of your stake in this , 007. if you have a point , get to it .	the amount of money that killed robert king is the same amount as the ransom demand for elektra .
its a message . he wants us to know hes back .	who ?
claude serrault . a.k.a ...	renard .
sir robert tried to deal with the kidnapping with his own ... resources , at first . when elektras ear was delivered to him in the post , he came to me . i advised against paying the ransom . i knew it was renard . i played it out as long as possible to get a fix on him .	sacrifice the girl to take out the terrorist ?
he survived ?	the doctor who saved him couldnt get it out , so renard killed him . when interpol found the x-rays , there was mild jubilation . effectively , hes a dead man .
the bullet is moving through the medulla oblongata , killing off his sense of touch . he feels no pain . he can push himself harder , longer than any normal man .	that which does not kill me makes me stronger .
now robert is dead . he got his revenge .	hes not through yet . renard doesnt blow up five million dollars unless he knows theres more coming in . hes working for someone . someone who wants to stop the pipeline . and they hired the perfect killer . one with a vendetta against king ... and you .
get out to the pipeline . find the insider who switched the pin . if your instincts are right , renard will be back . he hasnt completed the job . the pipeline is still going forward , and we have elektra to thank for that .	the worm on the hook again .
the report king bought . its a manual . renards men used it to remove this radio tracking device from the warhead .	then robert was right about a russian connection .
theyre getting their weapons from the russians , but where are they getting the money to buy the weapons ? i cant help thinking ... the person close to king , the one who switched that pin ...	the inside man ?
not the usual swiss procedure , mr. bond , but you understand , a man in my position..	which is neutral , no doubt .
i did not get the report from an mi-6 agent .	who did you get it from ?
i am just a middle man . i am doing the honourable thing and returning the money to its rightful owner ...	and we know how difficult that can be for the swiss .
your last chance . take the money .	your last chance . give me the name .
the name ?	i cant tell you ... alright , alright ! but you must protect me !
i see my friend davidov ran into some difficulty .	indeed .
revenge isnt so hard to fathom . whats clever is getting someone else to pay for it .	not many people in this world have that kind of fortune .
who is it ?	you think i fear death ? i welcome it . i get on my knees and pray for it . you , on the other hand , you have something to live for , no ? shes beautiful isnt she ? you should have seen her before . flawless , and still so innocent , not such a whore in bed ...
you will never touch her . you will never get near her .	have you forgotten who saved your life in geneva ?
consider me ungrateful .	its i who should thank you -- for taking that money back to mi-6 . so distressing for m. an explosion inside her lair .
shell get over it .	you even brought the plane for us . we really couldnt have done it without you .
in case youve forgotten . im dead already .	havent you heard the news ? so is she .
beautiful , isnt it ?	yes .
today , of all days , the sun decides to shine .	perhaps sir robert had a word with the man upstairs .
a word ? im sure by now hes engineered a hostile takeover .	you knew him well ?
he was my father .	im sorry .
i met you at my fathers funeral .	yes .
i havent been able to recall a single moment of that day ... until now .	funerals arent exactly memorable .
god no . all those horrible loved ones and relatives . i dont want to talk to those people . i just want to ... talk to my father . i loved him . im not sure he knew that .	is that why you want to finish the pipeline ?
who is he ?	my bodyguard . he follows me everywhere . hes decisive , vigilant . and he makes an excellent omelette .
how long has he been with you ?	since the kidnapping . why do you ask ?
does this look familiar to you ?	its my fathers pin . he wore it everyday of his life .
are you trying to break my heart ? or is it just your way with women ?	its not the pin your father wore . its an exact duplicate . inside is a tiny electrical detonator . we have reason to believe the assassin had an inside accomplice , someone who worked at this company .
the killer doesnt want to see this pipeline continue , doesnt want to see you take over ...	thats every man within a five mile radius . including you . thats why youre here , isnt it ? you think i cant do it . you think im going to screw up . or get myself killed .
i think running this pipeline would be a difficult job for anyone . especially kings daughter .	you are wrong , mr. bond . in fact , i am the only person who can do it .
i have to check the upper lines . gabor will drive you back .	always wanted to see the upper lines .
you dont take no for an answer , do you ?	no .
oh my god ... were buried alive ...	were alright .
i cant stay here .	youre not going to .
no ! it will cave in !	its the only way out ...
i cant stay .	i know .
the way i acted , in the snow ... you must think im a coward .	i think youre one of the bravest people ive ever met .
what is it ?	... you should rest .
james ...	i have to go .
then take me with you .	no . youll be safe here .
i dont want to be safe !	i have to go to work .
vodka martini .	two . shaken not stirred .
what the hell are you doing here ?	someone wants to kill me , id rather die looking him straight in the eye . what are you doing here ? looking for a woman a little more your type ? how about that one ?
if this little show is for my benefit , ill take you home right now .	you had your chance , james . now im looking for a bigger thrill .
i understand its normally good practice to get the feel of the cards before going off the deep end .	really ?
surely you believe in living dangerously .	not at that price . time to surrender .
you knew when you first saw me . you knew it would be like this .	shush .
how did you survive ?	i used my body on the guards . it gave me control . i got to a gun and i took my chance . ive never told anyone that .
whats wrong with you ? are you crazy ?	a little . does it matter ? after all , whats the point of living if you cant feel alive ? isnt that right , elektra ? isnt that your motto ?
what are you talking about ?	or did you steal it from your old friend renard ?
... what ?	we had a run-in , he and i. he knew about us , he knew about my shoulder , he knew exactly where to hurt me ...
are you saying ... renard is the man whos trying to kill me ?	you can drop the act , its over .
i dont know what youre talking about !	i think you do .
how dare you ! how dare you ! that animal ! ? that monster ! ? he disgusts me ! you disgust me ! so he knew where to hurt you , is that it ? you had a sling on your arm at the funeral ! i didnt have to sleep with you to find that out .	he used your exact words .
im coming with you .	you do what you have to do , but ive called in m. shes en route from london even now .
i could have given you the world .	not interested .
wheres m ?	soon shell be everywhere .
all this , because you fell for renard ?	five more turns and your neck will break .
since i was a child , ive always had a power over men . when i realized my father wouldnt rescue me from the kidnappers , i knew i had to form a new alliance .	you turned renard .
so you killed your father .	he killed me ! he killed me the day he refused to pay my ransom .
was this all about the oil ?	it is my oil ! mine and my familys !
it runs in my veins , thicker than blood . im going to redraw the map . and when i am through the whole world will know my name , my grandfathers name , the glory of my people .	no-one will believe this melt-down was an accident .
know what happens when a man is strangled ?	elektra , its not too late . eight million people neednt die .
one ... last ... screw ?	oh james .
valentin zukovsky .	bondjamesbond . what brings you here ?
you , of course . i need some information .	bond , im a civilian . this is my place . used to be the royal familys , now its mine . i run my little business , i stay out of trouble ...
mafia warlords , diplomats and spies , consortiums from every country in the world . a nice little rats nest .	have some of the rats nest caviar . from my own fishery . they buy my caviar , drink my champagne , lose to my house .
see ? youre upsetting my customers . what do you want ?	how does a terrorist like renard supply his men with state-of-the-art russian army weapons ?
if i remember my cyrillic that says 101st airborne division .	where did you get this ?
that too . everyone does what they can to survive .	how high up does this ... arms dealing go ?
bond . if someone wants you dead , it is renard . our government has nothing to gain by killing you .	but you would have something to gain by killing robert king . and stopping his pipeline .
what are doing , bond ? trying to impress this innocent thing ?	shes no innocent . this is my nuclear consultant .
really bond , couldnt you find a nice russian scientist with hair growing out of his ears ?	whats your business with elektra king ?
i thought you were the one in her business .	she dropped a million and half dollars to the house -- your house . and you didnt even bat an eyelid . she was paying you off . what for ?
that is 5,000 dollars of beluga ruined !	you are out of your league . shes working with renard .
now ... where were we ?	a rope !
alright , alright ! sometimes i smuggle machinery for her . russian stuff .	and the payoff on the tables ?
wheres the sub going ? !	no ! get me out !
this is too big for even you . where is it ?	this is a family matter ! if my nephew is in danger , we do it my way , or nothing ! now get me out !
so . my way . no mi-6 , no interpol . just you , me and my people .	where ?
mother of god .	the right kind of explosion in the right spot -- it would block the bosphorus , cut off the black sea .
the maidens tower .	how appropriate .
what ?	to haul some cargo . my nephew , he is captain of a sub in the black sea fleet .
no ! bond !	bond !
what is this place ?	former kgb surveillance post . the dye factory was just a front ; now it turns a good profit .
in the good old days , the kgb had three or four spots where our submarines could surface without anyone knowing . but yevgeny is supposed to be loading cargo .	what class sub does your nephew run ?
ill send someone out .	could ... could you come ?
perhaps this isnt the time ...	please .
your people ? your people will leave you here to rot just like you left me . you and my father . he didnt think my life was worth the chump change he spent on a day at the stock market .	your father ...
now you know how it feels . to be locked away , to wonder if theyre coming for you , if anyone will ever come for you .	someone will come .
warm .	is it ?
so beautiful . so smooth , so warm .	how would you know ?
why are you like this ? because bond is dead ? its what you wanted .	of course ...
he was a ... good lover ?	what do you think ?
this is the end .	no . it is the beginning . the world will never be the same .
everythings under control up here . are you ready ?	yes . au revoir ...
weve been pawns in someones game . they tricked us into bringing the money to king . not just elaborate . cock-sure .	and expensive . cost three million plus .
do we have the range of renards plane ?	anywhere in this circle . iran , iraq , pakistan , syria , afghanistan ...
the parcels in the post .	its heading for the oil terminal .
any word from him ?	still no contact yet .
major adamson , i ca n't seem to get in the door .	laurie , i 'll have to ask you to come with me .
why ? what 's the problem ?	i ca n't tell you that . it is quite urgent .
the access code 's been changed . your card wo n't work anymore .	what ? !
what about our end ?	well , sir . . . in a worst-case scenario . . . we 'd assume that twenty-five percent of the russian birds get through .
what kind of time frame are we talking about ?	thirty minutes maximum . of course , i assume we 'd be in the fortified command bunker at the time of the launch order .
as you can see , we may be able to salvage a good-sized chunk of the farm belt .	what about the aftermath ? this so-called . . . `` nuclear winter '' theory ?
we do n't really know , sir , but bluntly , our survival capability . . . may depend on a quirk of the weather .	the weather . i see . keep me posted . i want hourly forecasts and a full report on optimum strike conditions .
had a lot of blood in him .	you oughta see upstairs . it 's a slaughterhouse .
no idea who 's behind this ?	small army , from the looks of it . he put up one hell of a fight .
he would -- you might as well know . it 's gon na get messy . we got a call from washington .	washington ?
walter --	do n't call me that .
walter -- you 're just telling me what you think i want to hear .	wrong answers ?
there 's no right or wrong . but if you do n't give me an honest response , i ca n't help you . i want to help you . i want to know all about you .	hnnrr . -- like to masturbate . shit once a day .
a whore fucking .	who is she ? do you know her ?
and what -- split -- the dog 's skull open ?	why , doctor . i did . he was a bad dog .
walter . this compulsion of yours -- to punish transgressors . in your mind . . . what gives you the right to judge ?	god is n't there to do it .
that man , then , he was the first . the first you --	saw the world that night -- random , empty , hideous . god did n't make it that way . we did . we make the world -- in our own image . what else can i illuminate ?
hi , jon .	hello , adrian .
the bearer of bad news .	we 've lost a colleague . the comedian is dead .
rorschach 's on the case . he 's got dreiberg in a lather . he seems to think that someone is `` stalking '' the watchmen .	oh ? the ctu suspects a libyan hit squad .
what 's your theory ?	life and death are unquantifiable abstracts . they do n't concern me .
i guess you 'll be dismantling russian tanks soon .	you mean afghanistan ? it wo n't require my attention . what i 'm doing here is far more interesting .
what are you doing , veidt ?	jon ! get back ! you do n't understand .
blake ? dead ?	yes . i heard this morning . washington 's asked me to attend the funeral as a matter of protocol .
i 'm here , laurie .	is it time ? d'you have to leave for the funeral ?
would you like me to stay ?	mm hmm .
i could stay and go .	. . . and just how would you manage that ?
i 'm not here . i 'm still on mars . i 've come to collect you .	collect me ?
in the immediate future we 're on mars . i 'm telling you goodbye . you 're trying to convince me to cure your illness . . .	jon , no -- i ca n't --
the atmosphere . i 'm sorry . these things slip my mind .	jesus , jon , i nearly choked to -- where are we --
this whole place is ticking . does it -- keep time ?	yes . in about . . . thirty seconds , for example , you 'll tell me you 're sleeping with dreiberg .
jon , does anybody know what the hell you 're talking about ? dan 's just an ordinary guy , but he talks to me . when he looks at me he 's seeing something more than just a -- a collection of atoms .	then you 're sleeping with dreiberg ?
well , i just , you just said -- do n't act surprised .	that 's how time works , laurie . everything is preordained . . . even my responses . we 're all puppets . i 'm just a puppet who can see the strings . -- thirty seconds .
jon -- there 's something i have to know . did you love me once ?	yes , i loved you . i left the earth when i lost you .
yet you must 've known all along that you 'd give me cancer . just be being with me .	i did n't give you cancer , laurie . not you , not the others . i do n't know what did .
but you knew that i 'd -- die .	memories of the future are just like any others . i 've tried not to dwell on the unpleasant ones . . . you wo n't die of cancer , laurie . there wo n't be time for that .
then it 's going to happen . the world 's going to end . -- and you 've always known .	always . ever since the day i died .
then why do n't you . . . do something about it !	because --
because you ca n't , i know , it 's preordained . so sorry . i forgot . jon . this , this `` script '' you 're following . . . who writes it ?	i do n't know yet . i should be able to tell you in -- roughly six hundred years .
i ca n't stand any more of this . i want to go back . if i 'm going to die i want to be with -- other people .	please , laurie . not yet . i 've got eons stretching before me , a universe to explore . i 'll be alone . you 're the last human being i 'll ever see .
jon , i do not want to hear it .	i 'm sorry . look -- there 's a gas storm on the valles marineris . . .
oh god . i 'm no more than a bug on a windshield to you .	you 're the only human being i care for .
then do me a favor . if the world 's going to end , it should n't matter a bit . i want you to cure me .	i wo n't do that .
you have the power to do it . i want you to do it . please .	i explained this . i ca n't . that 's not the way it happens .
what -- am i --	cured , yes .
its very strange . times flowing backwards . . .	jon -- what ? ?
jon , where are we ?	veidts complex .
jon --	space and time . i finally understand , laurie . i see it all now .
jon -- for gods sake , what do you see ?	i see what the watchmaker made . i see the universe !
the comedian . he 's dead . murdered . that 's all i know .	my god . murdered ? -- what 's this have to do with rorschach ?
it 's -- he 's got some kind of conspiracy theory . he thinks someone 's . . . i do n't know , stalking us .	us . you mean the watchmen .
i know , i know , it 's just -- he 's back on the street , he smells blood .	you know how he is . he goes on these binges , kills a couple of thugs -- then he 's satisfied . it blows over .
he 's bound to get caught . i do n't want my name coming out . not at this late date .	if he comes here , i 'll handle him . remember -- i 've always protected you . have n't i ? do you need money ?
no . i just wanted you to --	you did the right thing , daniel . let 's stay in touch , okay ? good night .
who ?	i do n't know , but . . . in the wake of all that 's happened , i 'm starting to think rorschach may have been right . is laurie okay ?
she 's with me .	good . be careful , daniel , do n't let up your guard . look , i 'm going to head south for a while -- hole up at karnak until all this blows over . you two would be welcome to join me .
yeah . see , i 've been working on a little project . top secret , of course . . .	the missing scientists .
what ? ?	i could n't let him interfere with my project .
it is jon . twenty-four years ago . before he turned into dr. manhattan .	good lord . how 'd you get it on tape ?
gentlemen , the past . unfolding before your eyes . stand back from the field . it 'll blow you to bits .	what is it ? how does it work ?
it 's a tachyon chamber . it generates subatomic particles which flow backward in time . there are other worlds , daniel , other timelines -- existing parallel to our own --	adrian -- you 've lost it .
dont be obtuse , daniel . if i kill jon in the past , none of this will happen . we wont even be here , will we ?	and what if youre wrong ?
im not .	what if youre wrong ? ?
your problem , dan , is a lack of vision . you spent all those years chasing after muggers , and drug dealers , and jaywalkers . . . as if the world was any better for it . as if any of it mattered .	you ruthless son of a bitch . you really believe this mad-scientist bullshit is going to save the world ?
sorry , it 's this thing with blake . i mean , you do n't really think anyone 's out to get us -- do you ?	dan , are you really that paranoid ? let 's face it , eddie blake was no mother teresa .
psychotic pig . he had it coming . mr. ctu . . .	now wait . we all had the same option as blake . it was work for the government or do time .
okay , okay . you made your choice . you went underground . some of us made other choices .	
damn straight .	damn straight ! we were heroes .
of course , we looked like idiots in those bondage outfits .	well , that was adrian 's idea . i know he 's the smartest man in the world and all that , but -- talk about publicity hounds . . .
hey . you remember that nut in the hockey mask ? with the asthma ? what was his name . . .	oh yeah . the one that used to confess to everything ? hoping we 'd beat him up ?
that 's the one . whatever happened to him ?	he pulled it on rorschach . . . and rorschach dropped him down an elevator shaft .
christ yes , i went in for a cancer scan first thing . gave me a couple of rough nights , i 'll tell you . . . how about you , laurie ?	oh , yeah . they gave me a clean bill of health and then booted me the hell out . no expense account . no place to live .
they 're not following me , dan . i mean -- jon 's gone , we 're right on the brink of world war iii . nobody cares about the watchmen .	maybe not , but why take chances ?
laurie , wait . i 've got a spare room . it 's empty . if you 'd like . . . laurie oh daniel , thanks , but i could n't . you 'd just be all nervous about --	no , screw that . what you were saying before , it 's absolutely right . -- i 'd love to have you stay .
oh . no . sorry . i 'll be right down the hall if you want me . . . i mean , if you need some aspirin , or --	i 'm gon na take a warm bath and sack out . -- you 've been really sweet . sleep tight , okay ?
his what ?	his . . . whatever .
i told you i was a little bit out of step . a lot of the old stuff i listen to -- it never came out on crystal .	i 'd say you stalled out about forty years ago . nellie lutcher -- louis jordan -- i 've never even heard of these people .
no wonder adrian 's rich . you use that stuff ?	sure . it works . i mean , look at this face , daniel . i 'm thirty-eight years old !
i do n't mind getting older . i 'm obsolete anyway . why try to hide it ?	i like the way you look . it 's strange with jon . he does n't age . his face does n't change . but you , daniel , you look . . .
old ?	not at all . you look very -- dashing . here , you pick one .
. . . what ?	pick a record . i feel like dancing .
eight cops ? oh , great . a jury 's gon na love that .	are you kidding ? if they put him in jail he 's dead . he 'll never get to trial .
i just realized . i 'd never seen his face . i guess it was just a matter of time . he 's totally -- daniel ? what 's wrong ?	the comedian . . . jon . . . now rorschach .
ohh . i could use some dinner . who was that on the phone ?	one more down . someone tried to kill adrian . . . . first time i 've ever heard him scared .
-- what is it .	i know what you 're thinking . you 'd be a lot safer if i were n't around .
laurie --	i 'm an open target , dan . if you 're with me --
enough is enough , daniel . where exactly are we ?	memory lane .
the owlship . i ca n't believe it .	-- i thought it was time for a routine maintenance check .
i took her out a couple of summers back . scared the hell out of some cows . -- i wonder if she 'd make it down to antarctica .	antarctica ? ?
adrian 's headed down to his secret retreat . he invited us to come along . i 've been thinking . if things do get nasty . . . it would n't be a bad place to sit out a war .	would you want to sit out a war ? i mean -- what would be left .
dan ! the spare costumes ! i ca n't believe you kept them .	me neither . mine barely even fits . the thing is , i try to remember why we did it , and i ca n't . helping people , or righting wrongs , or trying to save the world . . . i do n't know . it all seems so abstract .
god , you sound like jon . -- turn around .	what are you up to ?
this 'd better not be what i think it is .	okay !
what the hell -- ?	it 's a peace rally . the ctu 's just opened fire on the crowd .
they 're following us .	all right . mission accomplished .
missed 'em dan . you 're aiming high !	i do n't want to take 'em out . just want to keep 'em interested .
they 're practically on us . . .	that detroit shit ? i 'm so worried .
what ?	the costumes . am i right ?
no way . i 'm not that much of a pervert .	yes you are .
no offense , laurie , but it was silk spectre i had the crush on . tonight was the first time i 've felt like myself in ten years .	that 's because --
you 're full of yourself . what are you doing ?	long as we 're on the subject of perverts . . . i miss rorschach . let 's spring him .
what 's he doing ?	i think he 's going to the john .
i beg your pardon . . . ? some gratitude .	will you two lovebirds keep it down ?
welcome back , night owl .	what now ? fly south -- hook up with adrian ?
what was he doing ?	trying to change the past . he said it was the only way to save the world --
he saved himself . he changed the past .	where did he go ?
dan , is this -- is this new york ? ?	those cars . what year is this ? ?
dan -- what do we do now ?	wherever we are , it 's better than what we left . backs together --

maybe . or maybe somebody 's finally caught up with us . somebody with a grudge . thought you might want to spread the word .	hey . hey . if you do n't mind , use the back stairs , all right ?
. . . that was quick .	toilet clogged . short fat turd . let 's get out of here .
i do n't know if you heard . a hired gunman tried to off adrian .	veidt 's a fool . tried to warn him about new information . sicced his mangy cat on me .
what new information ?	blake investigating missing scientists for ctu . dr. manhattan somehow involved . . .
ctu . could be behind dr. manhattan frame-up .	what do you mean , frame-up ?
obvious pattern -- all ties in --	are you saying that someone would risk starting world war iii just to get back at us ? what about all those poor shits with cancer ?
how do we know they 've got cancer ? could be part of massive propaganda scheme . . .	come on , rorschach . gim me a break --
where 's laurie ?	i do n't think she 's coming with us .
we 're running , rorschach . we 've got no place to go . we 're hightailing it down to adrian 's .	veidt 's assassin . leads to follow . ca n't just --
cases , leads -- they do n't matter , rorschach . the world 's about to end . if someone is trying to kill us , it does n't matter .	coward . giving up .
sorry , daniel . you 've always been a good friend . i know that . sorry about laurie .	okay , let 's just . . . thank you .
what happened ?	the guidance system 's fried . i had to switch to manual . -- some kind of massive electromagnetic shockwave .
what caused it ?	do n't know . nothing i can think of -- -- outside of a nuclear blast .
adrian . what are you doing ? why would n't you let us in ?	he 's the one . he 's been the one all along . stalking us .
. . . and they call me a fucking nut .	adrian . its too late . the world is blowing up as we stand here .
i 'll say . if we ever get off this looney-tune project , i 'm gon na head straight for civilization and buy me a big thick steak .	with lots of ketchup ?
nothing wrong with ketchup .	jon osterman , you do n't act like a princeton boy . what 's a big lug like you doing in a place like this ?
anything for science , i guess . janey , there 's something --	we should get back -- what ?
nothing . what were you going to say ?	we should get back to the lab . you okay , jon ?
stupid watch . stopped again . do you have the --	janey , will you marry me ?
i can fix it .	-- what ?
sphinx brand . when i got out of weapons design , i wanted to move into a more . . . humanitarian area . i was thinking : what would do some good in the world ? and i thought : why not a genetically-altered tobacco , that no only does n't cause cancer -- but cleans out your lungs as you smoke it ? in fact i think i 'll have one now . care to join me ?	thanks , no . but it 's a wonderful product . now adrian -- your old colleague dr. manhattan has just left the planet amid rumors --
no . no . cut . -- justine , we agreed . no questions about the watchmen .	oh sweetheart , just a quick one .
no comment .	did you know he was back on the streets ?
i did not . now get out of my way !	is n't it true that you --
their real names , please .	i do n't know their real names .
you 're lying , miss juspeczyk .	i do n't know their real names !
you 're not `` protecting '' anyone . these people 's lives may depend on the answers you give . these are all former associates of dr. manhattan --	then why do n't you ask him ? ! ?
sit down , miss juspeczyk . as i mentioned , the people in this file are all close associates of dr. manhattan . they have something else in common as well . they 've all developed a fairly . . . exotic form of lymphatic cancer .	what are you saying ? that jon is radioactive ?
i 'm terribly sorry .	what does this mean ? what does it --
six to eight months . that 's with treatment . -- perhaps now you can see why it 's so vital that we locate your . . . friends .	that 's it . this is all a trick , is n't it ? some kind of horrible joke to make me --
all right , miss juspeczyk . pack your things .	am i free to go ?
you 're free to do whatever you goddamn well please . let 's move it .	i do n't know why you 've been keeping me here , but you 're in deep shit --
oh , i am , honey . you see , russian tanks are crossing the afghan border this very minute . and we are all of us , every living soul , in deep , deep shit -- because our number-one strategic weapons has finally flipped out .	jon ? ? you mean he 's --
adrian .	laurie ! good to see you .
do n't rub it in . i live here .	and how 's life with the walking h-bomb ?
adrian ! do n't leave so soon . i --	i 'll take a raincheck , laurie .
he 's a little farther gone every time .	stay , adrian . i just -- every once in a while , i need to talk to someone human . he does n't think like we do . he does n't even feel what we feel . i mean -- he even scares the research teams .
laurie -- he 's the most powerful man who 's ever lived . he 's changed the world .	i know . i should n't be saying this . he 's happy , he 's content , he 's doing his work --
what about you ?	i suppose i 'm serving my purpose , are n't i. i 'll ring for the guards .
nasty cough . -- try one of mine . darling , you need to get out of the house . why do n't you give daniel a call ? i 'm sure he 'd be glad to hear from you .	maybe i 'll do that .
i do n't know who you are buddy , but i swear to god , you got the wrong guy .	edgar william jacobi , aka william edgar bright , a.k.a . moloch .
terrorist . radical agitator . stool pigeon .	all right ! all right ! ! -- how 'd you find me ?
rorschach , you 're talkin ' heavy duty stuff . i got nothing to do with --	worked both sides of the fence . ask your old buddies in the ctu .
ctu ? jesus . you do n't think --	do n't know . ask around . i 'll be back .
two things i hate . street mimes . . . users of recreational drugs .	no , no . you got it all wrong . i been on the case , rorschach , i got something for you .
new information .	ever see one of these before ?
too important for telephone . comedian -- dr. manhattan . all linked up .	what is that ungodly smell ?
bigger than i thought . ctu involved . . .	yeah , i 've heard all about your conspiracy theories . now i 've got a roomful of cameras in there . i want you out . now . and whatever you 're doing , knock it off . you 're making us all look bad .
gila flats -- place where jon turned into . . .	dr. manhattan , right . now if you boys care to join me , we 'll go save the world .
veidt . you 're the one who started world war iii .	no . i just hastened the inevitable . he 's been ready to blow for years . i knew all it would take was a little push . so i , uh . . . gave his friends and associates cancer .
call off the cat and i 'll kill you , veidt .	before you do that , you might want to look at what i 've been looking at .
who the hell are you ?	the name 's gibbons . you were saying ?
what is this place ?	looks like a diner .
most guys we ran through this either took off or helped them rob the place . i expected you to do the same .	that shows me already that you do n't have a clue . what 's it to you , anyway ?
whether you thought this was for real or not , you jumped in and helped the waitress on instinct . that tells me something about your character .	good for you . now why do n't you stop wasting my time and tell me what you want . you did n't go through all this for my benefit .
it 's your lucky day . you just might get the chance to pay back our wonderful country for all the freedom you enjoy .	a fed , i shoulda known . who else would have this kind of budget ? now you 're gon na hit me with the sales pitch .
alright , cage , you 've got me . this is one of those moments . `` many are called , few are chosen '' , that kind of thing . your government needs you . are you up for the challenge ?	..if you 're trolling around for narcs , man , have you got the wrong guy .
why is that ?	look at me , dude , do i look like a fan of law enforcement ? forget the tests , you shoulda just asked me . i woulda saved you a lot of trouble .
oh i do n't know , i think the tests work pretty well . sometimes they give me answers you would n't admit to in a million years .	are we done now ? you 've got nothing on me . so if you ai n't booking me , i 'm walking .
you 've got this wrong . you 're not under arrest , you 've been abducted . and until i say different , you belong to me .	is that a fact ?
sure as gravity . i 've had a feeling about you from the start , cage . it 's nausea .	you know what i hate ? any scumbag with a clean shirt and a bad haircut can get one of those tin stars and suddenly they think they 're god .
congratulations , you 've just graduated at the head of your class .	you 're a cold piece of work . you almost got three people killed out there .
you 've really got me confused , cage . on the one hand you showed leadership , courage under fire , a willingness to protect men you hardly knew ... and on the other you have an arrest record that pegs you as near sociopathic . help me out here . i 'm not following your evolution .	you want the cheap backstory ? the runaway mom , the suicide dad and the foster homes ? gim me a break . you 're not interested in my past , you 're interested in my future as some kind of spy .
you 're perceptive too . i forgot to add that to the list of surprises . i 'm with the national security agency . and unlikely as it may sound , i need your help .	i 'm not interested . i 've already got a job .
you 're an adrenaline junkie with one foot in the penitentiary . you risk your ass building a daredevil myth that means nothing and you 're not getting any younger .	i plan on getting a lot older . and playing spy games sounds like a quick way to get yourself dead .
now i 'm the one who 's nauseous . so what 's the deal ? what do you need me for ?	there 's some folks i want to keep tabs on . dirty , tattooed , uncivilized . your kind of people .
what do i get out of it ?	if you find out what i want to know , and if i 'm able to successfully use that information , you get to go back to your degenerate little life . if not , you take a bath .
not bad for a gimp .	what 's with that `` x '' on the back of your head ? does that mean you 're `` extreme '' ? i 've got some news for you , mr. x , you 're a three time loser . so maybe you should tattoo another couple of x 's on your head .
how about a pedicure as long as you 're down there . what 's this ? lo-jack ?	wherever you go on the planet , i 'll find you . there 's no quitting . if you try to take it off , a ring of needles will inject enough curare into your bloodstream to kill you before you hit the ground . is all that clear ?
i expect you to call in regularly with progress reports .	fine , but i 'm not gon na be no bulldog omega 5 .
up yours .	crude and defiant as always , triple x. it fits so well because you 're obscene .
is that all ?	just remember , i 'll be watching .
i guess you got my e-mail . i set up a purchase . ten cars .	if you 're trying to push my buttons , you 're on the right track . do n't make me question my own judgment , x .
buddy , you sent me here to get close to their organization , that costs money .	one point two million dollars ? i did not authorize you to spend one point two million dollars !
i 'm already on a first name basis with these dudes , i got a deal set up , you want me to hammer it or not ?	we 're not after car thieves here .
what the hell am i after ? you 're telling me dick .	that information is classified . you 're there to gather information on their operations , period .
call me crazy , but i thought hooking up a million dollar deal was a great way to get on their good side . what else ? you gon na hassle me about the weapons and spy stuff too ?	my friend , if you 're planning on crossing me ...
you did say `` ahab '' ? you 're sure about that ?	yeah , i sent you pictures . here 's what i 'm thinking . if they take out the cameras and sensors , they could probably put a bomb in this thing . you drop it in the water in the red sea and three weeks later it 's swimming up the potomac .
this is good work , x , damn fine work . you need to press on at all costs , find out what they have planned with this `` ahab '' .	hey , one miracle at a time . they 're on to me now , remember ?
thanks .	you 're a grungy little phoenix , you know that ? keep up the good work .
snow covered fortress . army of bad guys . the usual .	i 'm on the way with a team to relieve you . what 's the latest ?
they retrofitted ahab with some kind of rocket launcher . they were loading canisters of liquid into it , light colored and dark colored in the same tube but separate . something tells me this it that `` classified '' stuff you did n't want me to know about . does the song `` silent night '' mean anything to you ?	yes it does .
come on , gibbons , you can do better then that .	silent night is the name of a top secret binary nerve agent . the glass canister is shot into the air and detonated . the black and white chemicals mix , forming a toxic cloud . when it settles down to earth , it 'll kill everything in the vicinity .
jesus christ , gibbons , this is something we came up with ?	yeah , that 's right . so now that you know , you understand why it 's important that we get it back .
kinda funny , though , is n't it ? we 're not supposed to be making weapons like that anyway . guess we shoulda played by the rules .	somebody else makes those decisions , not guys like you and me . you 've done your job , x , head back to prague . i 'll be landing in 90 minutes . this is my operation now .
thought you bought the farm down there , x. glad as hell to see you .	i 'm pretty happy to see me too . so are you done with me yet ?
you 've kept up your end of the bargain , i 'll do the same . but you really should consider staying on , you make a decent agent .	but i hate cops , remember ? except for her .
cut the crap , x , i saw you down there . you 're a hero . do n't be afraid to join the good guys .	who says you 're the good guys ?
you know what they say , the only way to change the system is from the inside .	oh yeah ? why do n't we start by taking this thing off my ankle ? the poison needles ?
on come on , x. did you really think we were that barbaric ?	no needles , huh ? what about the acid bath ?
all for show . just a psychological mind game to get you to do the right thing .	you 're a jerk-off , you know that ?
what do you have ?	not a whole helluva lot . his final transmission was mangled . about something or someone called `` ahab '' . whatever it is , it cost him his life .
he was the best there was . that makes three agents lost .	they 're ruthless and they have a lot of firepower . it 's only a matter of time before they figure out how to deploy silent night . then we 're gon na have a catastrophe on our hands .
silent night in the hands of a bunch of impertinent cowboys	we 're gon na have to step in , sam . those cia boys could n't find a clown in a field of cactus . let me take care of it .
how will you fix it ?	i 'll go in with a team . but first i 'm going to need some intel . i 'll have to put someone inside , someone new , someone they wo n't see coming . one of their own .
so you 'll dredge the bottom again . you 've done that before . the results were ... uneven .	you wan na find out about rats , ask a rat . i 've had my people put together a talent pool . i downloaded it to your desktop .
the usual prospects . convicts , contract killers , murde ...	the scum of the earth .
but programmable . and expendable .	i 've seen enough . turn it off .
they 're degenerates . there 's not a man in there that would give a damn if the chinese took over .	that 's exactly why we need them .
ridiculous . cut him off . i 'm sorry gibbons , you pulled up a shark this time .	i think we should send him whatever he wants .
you what ? a wire transfer of this size ?	if it means getting silent night back , absolutely .
you 're talking about a very expensive risk here .	he 's gotten closer in 24 hours than all of the other operatives combined . he got us an account number to boot . now even if he 's just dumb and lucky , i say we back his play . i put him out there , sam . if he does n't come up with the money , they 'll kill him . i ca n't let that happen .
alright , do what you want . but keep the screws on him . he 's a wild card . that could be either good or bad .	so the odds are up to fifty-fifty ? i can deal with that .
whatchu doing here ?	oh , i do n't know . it was an accident .
we seen this kind of parachutes before , you know . u.s. army . you got some friends here , jump out with you guys ?	we 're anti-social . we do n't have any friends .
we 're on to the game , ese . you got the fake blood splattered all over the walls , you got your torture tools ... it 's all very cute . but come on , let 's quit while you 're ahead . i 'm only trying to save you a beatin ' .	you saving me ? you talking pretty tough for a guy got himself chained to the ceiling .
alright . you wan na eat through a tube , be my guest .	now you 're gon na make me enjoy this , funny guy . now i 'm gon na take the whole foot off . whatchu think of that ?
what game is that ?	slick graphics , huh ? see these dudes ? they 're called `` anarchy 99 '' , they 're the bad guy bosses .
do they have any special powers ? the bosses always have special powers .	you wan na check it out ? come here .
next we got a siberian redneck , viktor . into snowmobiles and snowboarding . so naturally , he covers prostitution and the drug trade .	naturally .
this guy 's kinda dorky lookin ' .	kirill , the sniper . looks like a bookworm , but he had 72 confirmed kills in chechnya , they called him the `` finger of god '' . assassination and weapons .
yorgi masterminded the take-over of three red mafiya clans . cops called it `` blood week '' . he combined all of their global enterprises into one huge crime syndicate : anarchy 99 .	`` anarchy '' 99 '' ?
what are you gon na do ? they 're euro- trash .	what weapons do you have ?
just about anything i want , it looks like . this is gon na be tough , though . there 's no way to save this game . i got ta get it right the first time through .	what do you get if you finish ?
nothing , really . my guy is just doing it to stay alive .	oh . i bet by the end he gets something out of it .
like what ?	he gets to be the hero .
ten is hardly worth the effort . we 're talking a lousy million five u.s .	i have japanese buyers who are looking to move a fleet , if you have the quality of merchandise they 're after . and it 's a mil two , max .
do you know what a wire transfer is ?	is she for real ? honey , maybe you should quiet down and let the grownups have a conversation .
my goodness , a word with four syllables . i should get some ice before your brain gets too hot .	sure . just chisel some off your heart .
if you got a problem with me , why are we dancing ?	yorgi asked me to .
you do everything yorgi says ?	go to hell .
it 's gon na be like that , huh ? you got all bent out of shape as soon as he started dancing with someone else . why 's that ?	mind your business .
where are you going ?	why are you still hanging around ? your business is finished , you should go home .
i was invited . what 's your story ?	i do n't know who you are or where you come from , but i do n't like you . you ask too many questions .
come on , do n't front like that . you 'll put a guy right off you .	do n't even bother , x man , i 'm not your type .
who are you ?	we hung out last night , remember ?
i also remember you drove your car here . who are you really ? make no mistake , i will shoot you and not feel bad about it . who are you working for ?	hey , take it easy . i 'm just a dude trying to make a buck .
bullshit . i see you look at everything , study everything , ask questions . i know exactly what you 're doing . empty your pockets .	you 've got to relax , baby , you 're paranoid .
hey , you 're good .	maybe we should start again , yes ? i know so little about you , except that you 're not what you say you are .
i do n't know what you 're talking about .	the eyes do n't lie . all this has gotten to you , has n't it , petra ? you came in as yorgi 's girlfriend and you stayed because it was fun . now you do n't like it so much , but you 're in so deep you ca n't get out anymore . tell me if i 'm wrong , petra .
go to hell !	look at you . you 're helping run things now . you 're a gangster . i bet that snuck up on you . you woke up one day and you were a criminal .
what are you ?	i 'm an information gatherer . you wan na go somewhere and talk about it ?
that 's how you eat ? it 's like a gerbil .	i 'm from l.a .
so why do n't you tell me something about who you gather information for . they obviously have very deep pockets . are you from a rival clan ?	let 's just say i 'm freelancing and leave it at that .
whoever sent you knew what they were doing . you and yorgi are practically twins . two nihilistic fashion victims who make a lot of noise but do n't say much .	do n't judge a comic book by it 's cover .
you agree with a lot of what he says , do n't you .	i know where he 's coming from . the only thing i really do n't get is why he dumped you . up until i found that out , i thought his judgment was pretty sound .
do n't even start . i 'll be honest , i do n't trust you . bur lets pretend for a minute that what you say is true , that i want to leave . what can you do about it ?	the people i know want facts , the kinds of things an insider would know . they 're interested in putting anarchy 99 out of business .
all i have to do is risk my life providing you with these facts .	we could work together . then maybe we could both get the hell out of here . there 's a beach in bora bora with my name on it .
a beach named x ? that i 'd like to see .	so there you have it . i guess you just have to ask yourself , how bad to you want out ?
they tell me you 're an american agent .	what are you talking about ?
there 's no more time for games . they made you . there 's a sniper out front waiting to put a bullet in your eye . tell me if it 's true .	it 's a long story , but yeah , more or less .
jesus christ . you 're going to have to go out the back . the data that you copied with your toy . tomorrow , at six o'clock . look it up . we 're taking a trip . be there at six and you 'll have plenty to tell your people .	if i go out the back , he 'll know you 've warned me .
that 's alright , i 'll figure something out .	not an option . just get up slowly like everything 's cool . petra , trust me . you just hung yourself out to dry for me , i 'm not gon na let you down .
i ca n't let this happen . i want you to go out the back . i 'll make up some excuse .	they 'll kill you , you know they will . besides , there is no back door . keep smiling . ready ? now .
so what 's the plan with this ahab ? are they selling it or what ?	no , something worse . he says it 's a surprise , but i know him . this is his masterpiece .
we 've got to find out what it is . can you handle that ?	there 's something i did n't have time to tell you before .
what 's that ?	i 'm a agent as well . kgb . i 've been undercover for over a year .
you 're what ? what the hell have you been doing ?	i do n't know . eight months ago i stop hearing from my people . no explanation , just silence . so i stay and i wait like i was told . soon i 'm in so far , they 'd kill me if i left . now every day i get farther and farther away from what i was . i 'm like you said , a criminal .
no , i guess i 've been no help at all to you .	get your head back in the game . there are lives at stake here .
of course . i 'll do what i can . i have to go , before they notice .	when can i see you again ?
are you alright ?	what the hell are you doing ? you could 've killed me !
i heard you talking . i could tell where you were in the room .	i do n't know what 's going on anymore . i thought i was square with that dude . now everybody 's switching sides like it 's the wwf .
what are you doing with the ivans ?	i know which cops are good and which are bad . come with me . come on , right now .
where are we going ?	we 're getting out of this place . we 've done enough .
wait a minute , whoa . we ca n't go now . what 's yorgi got planned with that nerve agent ?	it does n't matter anymore , forget it .
of course it matters . hey , hold on !	what do we owe our governments ? yours kidnapped you , mine abandoned me .
petra , this ai n't about the people that sent us here , you know that .	no , now it 's about us . let 's do something for us before we both get killed . do n't you want to get to bora bora , xander ?
we ca n't leave now . we have to do something .	why ? you 're the one who believes in nothing . screw the world , or whatever you said .
they left . to a fortress in the mountains .	we 'll have to go after them .
are n't you afraid ?	a long time ago i learned how to put fear away in a little place in my head . maybe that 's my problem . if you do n't feel fear you can do some amazing things , but you can also screw your life up in ways you ca n't imagine .
i must be healthy , then , because i 'm scared to death . i guess i 'd better get back to yorgi .	you do n't have to do that .
yes , i do . you 're right . i ca n't just let him go free . besides , i can help you from the inside .	are n't they gon na wonder were you 've been ?
i was supposed to wait for the cop to kill you and then kill the cop . they 'll believe me . i 've been lying for so long , one more time wo n't hurt .	when this is over , we 're just gon na take off , the two of us . take a vacation .
do n't you see , x ? for the betterment of humanity , he 's going to start world war three .	he 's a regular humanitarian . and all this time i thought he was just a tool .
yorgi and kirill .	let me guess , they had a big white torpedo with them .
did you do your homework ?	if they launch it , i know how to bring it back .
where 's he headed ?	he owns a big industrial complex on the river . he 'll launch it from there .
where 'd the damn truck go ? !	go to the water , it 's that way !
toadies right behind .	let me .
you okay ?	a piece of shrapnel hit me .
he 's shut out the communication circuit !	you ca n't talk to it ?
no , it 's like a safety . we are going to have to access the manual controls .	a manual control on a moving torpedo . this day keeps getting better and better .
it 's running three meters down . twenty knots .	it has to surface to release the nerve agent , right ?
by then it 's too late ! the only way to safely dispose of the nerve agent is in deep water ! the chemicals will break down and dissipate !	use your grenades ! maybe we can blow it up underwater !
i ca n't believe my mission is finally over . i do n't even know what to do with myself .	you ca n't welch on me now . we had a deal .
what are you doing ?	it 's about your next mission . you need to be debriefed .
nothing . he had two days .	perhaps he is not all he says he is .
what are you doing ?	it all happened so fast . such an unfortunate accident .
what was that for ?	i 'd forgotten how exciting it is working together .
you 've been so quiet lately , petra , i thought you no longer cared .	why do n't we go below decks and work off some of this adrenaline .
the peace conference ...	nice place to start , do n't you think ?
hate those russkie choppers . rattle- trap pieces of garbage . i 'm agent shavers . toby lee shavers . i 'm looking for what 's his name . three x ' s .	that 's would be me .
back off , just go away you klutz . alright , here 's the story . the items in these cases belong to me . i designed them , built them , and was going to use them in the field myself until you showed up .	i stole your beat , huh ? guess you forgot to brown-nose the right people .
is that supposed to be funny ? i 'm not laughing . i 've worked for ten years to get my shot at being a field agent , funny boy . and ar the last minute i get bumped by you , some reject from the ozzfest .	why do n't you show me some gear before you get hurt .
miniature power cams set in on contact , giving you a sure grip on any surface .	they come in any other styles or colors ?
this is your standard dart gun .	that one i 'm real familiar with .
i think i 'll hang on to these .	think again , that 's government property . you have to sign for everything . i 've got one more that was n't on your list .
from the beastie boys collection ?	it 's a stakeout suit . it 's got food , water , recording gear , anything you need for covert spying . it 's all- weather , fire retardant , and if you give this buckle a sharp pull , the whole outfit deploys into a parachute .
now that i 've given you the overview , we 're going to spend the next couple hours going into extensive operational detail .	i thought that was in detail .
hey , you do n't need all this just to go on vacation . unless this ai n't for going on vacation ...	i 'm through , xander .
i can see that . why ?	you run around with maniacs jumping motorcycles in the desert , you break 36 bones crashing wave runners and snowboarding off cliffs , all with no health insurance ... it 's insane , i ca n't take it anymore .
i 'm having fun , what 's the problem ?	you have all this talent , and you waste it . you wo n't take a single endorsement deal . meanwhile those other guys have their own video games ! but no , you 've got too much `` integrity '' for that .
french polynesia ? this would n't last us a week in a cheap hotel . do you know how expensive it is down there ?	alright , so i 'll get more .
it 's not about the money , x ! you never plan for anything . i ca n't live like that anymore , i need some stability .	well if you 're bailing , i guess i 'd better give you your surprise now .
what ... ?	i was gon na wait till the islands , but ...
you 're serious ?	of course i 'm serious . i bought it , did n't i ?
this is so typical . i ca n't believe you . i 've barely seen you for the last three weeks and now this ? are you out of your mind ?	i do n't know . i thought this is what you wanted . you want stability , here it is .
you ca n't just propose to me out of nowhere . you think that 's going to solve our problems ? i 'm sorry , x. it was a kick for a while , but it 's over . you 're just not going anywhere .	you 're not exactly `` going anywhere '' yourself .
sit down .	i 've been on a plane for twelve hours , i think i 'll stand .
my name is slovo , czech secret police . when you are here you are under my jurisdiction , you take my orders , you do what i say . if you become any kind of an inconvenience , i 'll shoot you .	here we go again .
you 're here because your government is putting pressure on my government . this is an internal affair , a czech affair , that you are interfering with . i will warn you once : do n't shit in my lawn . get whatever information your government seeks and get our .	first of all , you should kill whoever sold you that suit . two , i do n't wan na be here either , so just step off . three , if you had the authority to shoot me you would 've done it by now , so just ease up on the machismo , bitch . now that we 've got that sorted out , i 'm gon na get some rest .
nice hops .	the corner . anarchy 99 .
i 'll leave you two alone to talk .	yeah , thanks a lot .
dude , what are you doing here ?	you killed me , remember ? now i have to hide out here with you . where have you been ?
i found something big enough for us to take these guys down with . they 've got a of nerve agent they 're gon na unleash .	is this what you 're looking for ?
sorry , `` dude '' .	what 's the deal ?
oh come on , do n't feel bad . you got played , so what ? you 're new at this . did you think you could just stroll into this business one day and have all the angles figured out ?	why you dogging me up ?
what 's so damn funny ?	been to any good diners lately ?
heads up , man . what 's this thing on my back ?	a parachute . this does not argue well .
who 's writing this dude 's dialogue ?	he 's a pretty good actor , though .
help me with this guy .	it 's like you said , every man for himself .
they 're all over the place ! what the hell 's going on ?	looks like we 're in the middle of the drug war .
that 's the guy .	this pizda ? never seen him before .
cops . like a plague . no matter how many you pay there 's always another with his hand out . how did you pick him out ?	he flashed his badge to half the bar when he bought his drink .
thanks , but i 'm here on business . i heard you 're the g around here . i 'm looking for some cars , expensive ones . a lot of them .	sorry , man , do n't know what you 're talking about .
i remember that one where you jump the motorcycle over the freeway at rush hour .	when else are you gon na do it ?
we seen all your shit ! so you want cars ? we get whatever cars you need . what are you looking for ?	ferrari 's , lamborghini 's ... high end pasta rockets . ten to start .
do n't look at me , x , she handles all the details .	it 'll work faster if i have an account number .
very nice . i 'm impressed .	i 'm somewhat less so . we seem to have a bit of a problem ...
i had to inspect the merchandise first .	of course .
what 's this ?	this is a gift . from me to you .
what 's going on , my friend ?	you tell me ! you got a sniper up there or what ?
he 's not with us , xander . he must be with you .	bullshit ! you get your boy off that roof or i swear to god i 'm gon na give you another hole to breathe out of .
i do n't believe it ! you ca n't shoot a cop in the middle of the street !	had to do what i had to do .
total chaos , man ! welcome to anarchy 99 !	what 's `` anarchy 99 '' ?
it 's all this craziness ! it 's what we 've been living since 99 , when we left the army . one of our brothers died in grozny and we said the hell with this shit . what for ? he dies for what ? politics ? who 's politics ? not ours .	you wan na see my politics ?
screw the world . if i 'm gon na die for something , it better be bitches and money .	that 's what i 'm talking about , man ! that 's why anarchy 99 was born .
to us it means no walls , no speed limits , no jails . it 's everybody does what he wants . people think democracy is freedom but they do n't have a clue . there 's an old punk song . it says : `` america stands for freedom , but if you think you 're free ... ''	`` ... try walking into a deli and urinating on the cheese '' . 'anarchy burger ' by the vandals .
you got it , man . it 's stupid but it 's true . true freedom is when you do whatever you want anytime you want . that 's when you know you 're living , man .	how you gon na do that with government and rules everywhere ?
you got a great set-up here yorgi . you really know how to live .	it 's a beautiful town , prague . it 's been good to me .
i 've been here before , when i was a kid . my old man was in the service , we used to live on the army base in hamburg .	you , an army brat ? i do n't see that one at all . did you join the service as well ?
hell no . my dad was a straight up tin soldier . somehow he pissed this general off and got himself dishonorably discharged . had a court martial and everything . the charges were total bullshit , so he was sure he 'd get his name cleared , but it did n't happen .	connections and politics , it 's the same everywhere .
i 've got meetings this afternoon , i 've got to get some sleep . just pick a girl .	that 's alright , i 'm kinda tired .
that was for anders .	do n't forget goatee boy . i greased him up on the diamond run .
and you . why do you have such a problem staying away , my friend ? did you miss us that much ?	i wanted to get the hell out of prague before silent night falls .
what 's the gimmick , yorgi ? that 's the part i do n't get . you gon na hold the world hostage with your gas bombs ? i did n't think you were dumb enough to go with that hack cliche .	you think i 'm after money ? i told you , my friend . anarchy . time for a change . money is good , but for true freedom you have to get rid of the rules themselves .
so all by yourself , you 're going to destroy every government ; in the world .	easier than that , buddy . i 'll get them to destroy each other . you kill an entire peace conference , someone is going to have to pay . then our friend ahab continues down the river to the ocean and begins his world tour . london , cairo , beijing ... pretty soon everyone 's involved . these guys bomb those guys , those guys invade these guys . soon the whole world is like your wild west cowboy days . no rules , no law , everybody free to do what they want .
including rape , pillage , murder .	sure , if that 's what you want . why not ? it 's all human nature . so we just have to launch our baby and wait for the decline and fall of civilization as we know it .
and here i thought `` anarchy '' was just something cool to put on a tshirt .	come on , xander . you used to stand for something . what happened to you , man ? i thought you 'd get it .
you both could have been a part of it . you could have ridden with us into a new day , the dawning of a new age of --	oh just shoot us already . i 'm sorry i asked .
what does that mean ?	the neuro-filter acts like a surge protector , regulating the infinite flow of information from cerebro to the professor 's mind . it 's what keeps him from being crushed by the consciousness of millions .
thomas edison knew how to make the light bulb . he had the energy source . he had the vacuum . but he did n't have the filament . he tried metal after metal but nothing would hold to power .	... until he found tungsten .
i wish i could go .	we all do .
storm . try to look for the highest vantage point . from what i can figure , he 'll need to gain as much altitude as possible to blanket the island . it is my feeling that magneto has to --	beast .
can the professor repair his own mind ?	i 'm afraid without cerebro 's help , he wo n't have the strength to heal himself -- and without the neuro- filter ... there 's no cerebro .
it appears as though magneto has built a machine which somehow triggers the mutator gene in normal human beings . and he is using adamantium as its core .	its core ?
correct ... apparently , adamantium is the only metal strong enough to hold the energy this machine produces . he used the adamantium in logan 's dog tag to test it on the senator . and i assume now he plans to use the rest of logan 's skeleton for a larger demonstration .	for what purpose ?
yes -- only there 's a problem . the mutator gene is not responding to the radiation the way it would in mother nature . it 's forcing the body 's cells to replicate thousands of times faster than they 're accustomed to . the senator 's body is literally burning itself out . scott -- this machine kills people and i do n't think magneto realizes it .	so where do you think he 's planning this larger demonstration ?
scott.. i -	i do n't like him being here .
what are you talking about ?	you saw what happened tonight . you think magneto wo n't come after him again . you think he wo n't come here if necessary . this is a school , for god 's sake .
what 's wrong with him ?	his vital signs are weak and getting weaker .
he 's already losing control of his vitals . respiratory . cardiovascular . unless we manage to replace the filter by tomorrow morning , i 'm afraid .	we have to find magneto .
are you all right ?	no . i 'm ... i do n't know if we can do this without charles .
hey . i 'm sorry . about logan . i was jealous .	well , i think that 's perfectly understandable .
i 'll tell you one thing though .	what 's that ?
radar stealth mode checks out . all right , there 'll be less security north of the george washington bridge . i 'm taking her down .	into the hudson ?
i 'm going to assume that means that the secret service is out of commission . jean , can you raise me up there ?	it 's too far .
jean ... can you ?	i 'm sorry . i 'm not strong enough .
inspiring -- now what am i doing here ?	i wanted to talk to you .
how long have you been in alaska ?	i do n't remember . is that what you wanted to ask me ?
i 've served with men like you before . methodical . systematic -- naive . you know what happens to those men in a real fight ?	you know , you --
i 'm o.k . i 'm o.k .	sure you are , sport .
anything else i can get you ?	some cigars . case of beer .
there 's no smoking or drinking on the school grounds .	i wo n't light the cigars - how about that ?
i 'll see what i can do -- you should get some sleep . even with your healing ability , you 're going to be hurting for a while .	what if i like the pain ?
the professor said you were a solider . actually , i believe he used the word mercenary .	yeah ? well i do n't like to talk about my past .
maybe , the professor could help you with that .	by reading my thoughts ?
if necessary .	what if they 're naughty ?
you should always work with a spotter .	he 's busy right now .
i was thinking maybe you and me could go into town .	were you now ?
what do you say ?	not interested .
let go .	suit yourself .
he 's uptight .	he takes his work seriously .
he takes himself seriously .	what is it you 're failing to get at ? are you interested in me ?
logan , do you see this ring ?	i 've seen a lot of rings .
you 're avoiding the question i posed to you at the beginning of the hearing , ms. grey . three words : are mutants dangerous ?	i am avoiding a question that is decidedly loaded , senator . the wrong person behind the wheel of a car can be dangerous .
ms. grey -- you work at a school for mutants in westchester , new york . can you tell the members of this committee what exactly you are teaching these mutants ?	math . history . science . english . athletics --
you would n't happen to be teaching them how to use their powers to --	control , senator ... we teach them control .
this was taken by a state police officer in secaucus , new jersey . a man in a minor altercation literally melted the car in front of him . i do n't know where you come from , ms. grey , but where i come from , you do n't go melting people 's cars when they cut you off . you do it the old fashioned way -- you give 'em the finger . but what you presume to tell this committee -	i presume nothing , i am here to tell you that in time , the mutator gene will activate in every living human being on this planet . perhaps even your children , senator .
dr. grey .	senator ?
i 'm sorry to come here , ms. grey . i was afraid if i went to a hospital , they would ...	treat you like a mutant ? we are not what you think . not all of us .
the mutant gene tells the body when it needs to change .	i can assure you , there is no such creature in my genes .
you ... wha ... who are you ... where is henry ?	mr. guyrich has been dead for some time senator .
whatever you do to me ... no matter what you 'll make me right . every word i have spoken will be confirmed .	gosh , i hope so .
the intention of registration act -	intention ? intention , senator ? we are talking about mankind here . his fear . it is only a matter of time before mutants will be herded into camps . studied for weaknesses . and eventually wiped off the face of the earth .
what is it you intend to do to me ?	let 's just say , god works too slowly .
i do love a good check mate .	what do you want ?
come with me and i 'll let her live .	you think i care about her ? i 'm the only one who 's sure to walk out of here .
where am i ?	you 're backstage at the encore of creation .
what are you going to do ?	in the road to survival , there is always sacrifice logan . we are the future ... not them . we must protect ourselves . after tonight , when the leaders of the world return home -- they will return as brothers , as mutants ... and our cause will be theirs . this is survival , i know you understand that , logan ... or is it wolverine ?
what am i doing here ?	i brought you here so that you would be safe from magneto .
who ?	a very powerful mutant who for some reason has taken an interest in you . i 'm not sure why , but until we find out , i must ask you to stay .
forty-eight hours , old man . but if you cross me , i wo n't feel any guilt about what i do to you .	deal .
the point of what ?	this . this whole god damn thing . making yourselves into some sort of `` team '' of super-powered freaks . teaching wayward mutants about classical literature . for what ?
the point is to step into a more evolved position of social responsibility . to recognize that there is a world out there and that we mutants are as much a part of it as normal human beings .	what if it never happens ? what if they 're so afraid of us that we become the enemy ? -- this place is gon na be one giant cemetery .
now that 's magneto talking .	no . that 's me talking . and you know what ? it 's only been thirty-two hours and you still have no idea what this guy wants with me .
where are we going ?	to find rogue .
how ?	the brainwaves of mutants are quite different than those of the average human being .
you designed this yourself ?	actually , magneto helped me put it together .
he helped you ?	we were friends once ... but that was a long time ago .
i 've found her , westchester mall .	i 'll go .
do n't you knock ?	they 're all asking how you 're doing . are you feeling up to saying hello to everyone ?
why ? you have a home here now , if you want it . everyone will ...	what ? ... miss me ? charley , i 'm gon na walk out the front door and trust me , it wo n't be soon enough for everyone here .
why is everybody up at sunrise ?	the sun is setting , logan . you 've been asleep for nineteen hours .
what did she do to me ?	she borrowed your power to save her life . when she touches someone , she absorbs their strengths -- their gifts . in your case -- your ability to heal . that 's why she keeps her body covered .
i felt like she almost killed me .	if she held on any longer she could have .
i lost him .	how ?
is that what you 're looking for ?	a piece . only a piece .
is it enough ?	enough for a test .
i 'll find him .	alive .
i 'll never understand your regard for them , charles .	and i 'll never understand terrorists .
i am trying to save our kind , charles . you should do the same .	not at the cost of lives , max .
the two in alaska . just how do you people manage to be in the right place at the right time ? still tinkering with cerebro ?	what do you want with him ?
is that so ?	still trying to make the world safe for our kind . still trying to find a way to introduce ourselves -- definitively .
you definition of definitive was always a bit extreme for me , max . what is it like these days ?	let 's just say that i am out to make some radical changes . now come on charles . for old times sake , for your sake ... leave him to me .
if i could make you understand . if you could just be made to see it the way i do . the way it 's going to be .	the way what is going to be ?
i 'm going to change the world with or without you as a witness , charles . and this one gets a front row seat .	what do you mean to do ?
this checkmate goes to you . i did n't want to hurt anyone . but you leave me no choice .	what do you mean to do ?
i would n't really have let you die , you know . i just needed ...	i know .
does n't it ever wake you in the middle of the night ? the feeling that some day , some day very soon , they will pass that foolish law - or one just like it - and they will come for you and your children ? take you all away ?	it does indeed , max .
and what do you do when you wake up to that ?	i feel a great swell of pity for the poor soul who comes to that school again looking for trouble .
excuse me , mr. waldman -- excuse me for interrupting . but is frederick , then ... a medical doctor ?	yes , my dear , he is .
and has he achieved ... any special degree of eminence ?	he is the fifth leading authority in his field .
oh , shit .	herr falkstein -- you must go at once and present dr. frankenstein with all the details of his inheritance . the estate will provide for your journey .
frederick frankenstein ?	you have the wrong house .
and who might you be ?	dr. frederick fronkonsteen .
the grandson of victor 'fronkonsteen ' ?	no !
what was your grandfather 's name ?	victor frankenstein .
forgive me for intruding so late at night , herr baron . but an ugly rumor has it that there are strange goings on in this castle . these good citizens are ready to rip you from limb to limb unless you can offer some rational explanation for their fears . how say you ?	ugly , vicious rumous .
they say , also , that you have recreated the horrible monster who , for so many years , has haunted and terrorized the god-fearing people of this village . what say you to that ?	poppycock !
i think we all need a good night 's sleep . why do n't we meet next week and thrash this thing out ?	now wait a minute !
where did you get this cauliflower ?	from your office , sir .
did n't you prepare it with the celery before my lecture ?	yes , sir . but i must have taken the wrong one when we came up .
no , sir . it will never happen again .	here ! this cauliflower is useless to me .
give him an extra dollar .	yes , sir .
yes , sir .	he has a big mouth . yes ! it seems to me i did read something about that incident as a student . but you have to remember that a worm -- with very few exceptions -- is not a human being .
carlson !	yes , sir ?
bring me some surgical gauze , a little tape and some disinfectant .	yes , sir . do you want the other cauliflower ?
herr falkstein ! did you inform frederick frankenstein of this assembly and all the particulars of the time and place ?	i did , sir .
but i received a cable only this morning , saying that he could not come .	was he aware of the importance of this occasion ?
yes , sir , he was . but he said he was obligated to lecture at johns hopkins university .	what lecture could be more important than the will of baron beaufort frankenstein ?
herr falkstein ! you have your instructions !	yes , sir .
what in god 's name are you doing ?	baack !
what ?	baack !
you 're incorrigible ! ... are n't you ?	mmmmmmm .
mmmmm !	is it that music ?
mmmmm ! mmmmm !	probably just some nearby cottage . nothing to worry about .
did you see ? ... i put a special hamper in the bathroom just for your shirts . the other one is just for socks and poo-poo undies .	mmmmm .
still happy you married me ?	mmmmm .
love me oodles and oodles ?	mmmmm .
so this is what it 's like to be completely happy !	mmmmm .
darling !	hello ... ?
surprised ?	well ... yes .
miss me ?	i ...
darling ! ... you will be careful ! ?	of course .
you have your tickets ?	yes .
and your passport ?	yes , do n't worry .
call me from new york before you leave ? ?	yes .
promise ? ?	i promise .
oh , darling -- i 'll count the hours that you 're away .	oh , darling -- so will i .
will you miss me ?	very ... .very !
mother 's going to help me with the invitations .	oh , nice .
i hope you like large weddings .	whatever makes you happy .
i 've trimmed the list to only our very closest friends ... but it still comes to three thousand .	you 're incorrigible !
does that mean you love me ?	you bet your boots it does .
i will ! goodbye , darling !	goodbye , darling .
goodbye , darling .	goodbye , darling !
darling !	darling !
surprised ?	surprised !
love me ?	love you ! ... well , why do n't we turn in ?
darling ! ? !	i mean , it 's been a long day . i 'm sure you must be as tired as i am . oh ! these are my assistants : inga and ayegor .
ready , darling ?	yes . i am a bit tired , after all .
what a strange fellow .	yes , he 's a little bit ... tilted . harmless , though .
are you suggesting i call him master ? ? ?	no , of course not . i just meant ...
poor delbruck ! there must be some way to reach him -- to control that body .	darling , you must n't worry so .
but there 's a genius inside that body -- crying out for love and understanding and normal human relationships . i just have to find some way to re-establish his communications system .	but you ca n't do that at night . and even if you could -- it would cost a fortune . come to bed , darling .
oh , delbruck , delbruck . was will dien tachlas von dir ?	you 've done everything that 's humanly possible , frederick . oh , darling , i 'm so worried about you -- you need rest .
i suppose you 're right .	of course i am . now come along like a good boy .
is your room just down the hall ? ... in case i get frightened during the night ?	yes , but ... i thought , perhaps tonight , under the circumstances , i might ... stay here with you .
i do n't want to spoil anything -- i just want to top it all off .	would you want me , now , like this , so soon before our wedding ? ... so near we can almost touch it ? or wait a little while longer , when i can give myself without hesitation ? ... when i can be totally and unashamedly yours ? ?
that 's a tough choice .	is it worth taking a chance ?
i suppose you 're right .	of course i am . now give me a kiss and say good night like my good boy .
good night .	that 's my good boy .
i hope you find this comfortable . this was baron victor 's room .	it seems fine .
you 'll fine the keys to all the rooms in my cas ... all the rooms in your castle on this ring . i 'll leave it on the table here .	does that include the key to the laboratory ?
you mean ... the laboratory ? ?	yes ! ... the laboratory .
no ! dr. frankenstein always kept that separate .	may i have it , please ?
there seem to be quite a few books .	yes , this was victor 's ... the baron 's medical library .
i see . and where is my grandfather 's private library ?	i do n't know what you mean , sir .
well , there was a public and a private library -- he said so in his will . these books are all very general -- any doctor might have them in his study .	this is the only library i know of .
surely he kept his notes -- his private papers and records in some other place ?	i think you must be mistaken , sir .
well ... we 'll see .	will there be anything else ?
i do n't think so . is my assistant taken care of ?	i put her in the guest room , just down the hall .
what are you waiting around for , pickle puss ?	this wire came while you were gone . your fiancee will be arriving any moment .
dr. frankenstein ?	fron kon steen !
oh , at least , sir . the land alone is worth a small fortune .	but i ca n't just drop everything and leave . i have responsibilities and obligations .
how long will this whole thing take ?	a week . ten days at most .
well ... if you 're sure that i could accomplish everything in a week ... i suppose i could manage it .	why did you do that ?
what ?	break that old man 's violin .
i did n't do that .	the old violinist -- you smashed his violin over your knee .
all right then , i suppose i owe the family that much . you 'll have everything ready for me when i arrive ?	yes , sir .
one week at the most ! ?	one week -- i 'll see to it , sir .
not at all -- a great privilege , doctor .	saturday night then ! i 'll take the train to new york and fly from there .
that 's 'fronkonsteen . '	i beg your pardon ?
my name is pronounced fron kon steen .	oh ! i thought it was dr. frankenstein .
no , it 's dr. fronkonsteen !	but are n't you the grandson of the famous dr. victor frankenstein ? ... who performed such fascinating experiments in electricity and galvanism ?
i prefer , by far , to be remembered for my own small contributions to science . now if we can proceed to your questions .	well sir ... i 'm not sure i understand the distinction between 'reflexive ' and 'voluntary ' nerve impulses .
in conclusion ... it should be noted that more than common injury to the nerve roots is always serious , because ... once a nerve fibber is severed ... there is no way to regenerate life back into it . are there any more questions before we leave ?	dr. fronkonsteen !
is n't it true that darwin preserved a piece of vermicelli in a glass case until , by some extraordinary means , it actually began to move with voluntary motion ?	a piece of what ?
vermicelli .	are you speaking of the worm , or ... the spaghetti .
but was n't that the whole basis of your grandfathers work , sir ... ? the re-animation of component parts ?	my father was a sick man .
but are n't you the least bit curious about it , doctor ? does n't the secret of life hold any intrigue for you ?	you are talking about the gibberish ravings of a lunatic mind .
yes , but , sir ... if it could be accomplished , would n't that eliminate disease from the human frame and render man invulnerable to any but a violent death ?	how old are you , young man ?
nineteen , sir .	nineteen ! my dear young man ... once the human organism has ceased to function , nature has deemed that creature to be dead .
but look at what 's been done with hearts and kidneys !	hearts and kidneys are tinker toys ! i 'm talking about the central nervous system .
but , sir ...	i am a scientist ... ! not a philosopher .
you have more chance of re-animating this knife than you have of mending a broken nervous system ,	but your grandfather 's work , sir ...
frederick frankenstein ?	fron kon steen !
are you putting me on ?	no , it 's pronounced fron kon steen .
and do you also say fro dereck ?	no , fred ereck .
why is n't it frodereck fronkon steen ?	it 's not . it 's fredereck fronkonsteen .
i see .	you must be igor .
no , it 's pronounced aye gor .	but they told me it was ee gor .
well , they were wrong then , were n't they ?	you were sent by herr falkstein , were n't you ?
yes , that 's right . my grandfather and your grandfather used to pal around together . you and i should have a lot of laughs .	i 'm sure we will .
this is inga . they thought you might need an assistant temporarily .	how do you do ?
are these your bags ?	yes , just the two .
incidentally -- i do n't mean to embarrass you in any way , but i 'm a rather brilliant surgeon . perhaps i can help you with that hump .	what hump ?
there .	i beg your pardon ?
there wolf ! there castle !	why are you talking like that ?
i thought you wanted to .	no .
suit yourself ... i 'm easy . better watch out for the wockers .	what wockers ?
the wockers with the knockers .	wockers with the knockers ? ? ?
home !	home .
down ! get down , you beasts !	i wonder what 's got into them ?
aye-gor !	fro-derick !
what are you doing here ?	i got frightened all alone upstairs , so i came down here .
but what you were doing ?	just putting up some tea .
did you hear that strange music ?	what ?
did you hear that strange music ? ?	what ?
it seems that way . you did n't hear any music at all ?	what ?
you did n't hear ... nothing ! are n't there any lights in this place ?	two switches over there , but i was n't going to be the first .
did you see anyone else down here ?	no , but when i first came in , there was a light coming from behind that steel door .
what is this place ?	must be the music room .
it is ! this was my grandfather 's private library . look at this !	'how i did it . ' good title !
taking the book along ?	yes , i think we could all use a good laugh .
what a filthy job !	could be worse !
how ?	could be raining !
very little decay . with this magnificent specimen for a body , all we need now is an equally magnificent brain . you know what to do !	i have a pretty good idea .
do you have the name i wrote down ?	yes . dr. h. delbruck .
i want that brain .	was he any good ?
hmm !	and he wrote seventeen cookbooks .
that 's not bad .	can you imagine that brain in this body ?
i 'm getting excited just thinking about it . what if he 's not there ?	he only died two weeks ago -- i 'm sure they 'll still have him . hurry now . i 'll prepare the body .
oh ! may i call you 'master ' ?	why ?
it 's always been one of my favorite names .	if you like -- just hurry !
you 're sure you know what you 're doing ?	yes ! it 's all written down in the notes . tie off the kites and come down !
you 'd better hurry -- i think it 's going to rain .	all right ... elevate me !
the ancient masters promised impossibilities and performed nothing . we shall penetrate into the recesses of nature . we shall ascend into the heavens . we shall command the thunders of heaven , mimic the earthquake and even mock the invisible world with its own shadows .	tonight ?
yes ! when i give the word -- throw the first switch !	you 've got it , master .
throw the second switch !	this guy means business .
it 's not enough . more ! more , do you hear me ?	what ?

you ca n't win 'em all .	but there must be a reason . this is science , not art .
cold ! cold and dead !	you must n't take it so hard . bucharest was n't built in a day .
do n't try to cheer me up that way .	well , i do n't like to see you mope .
you 'll be getting me sad next .	i 'm sorry . i do n't mean to take out my frustration on you . you 've been a great help to me , and i 've let you down .
i 'm not that sort you know . i appreciate you feelings , but try to show them some other way .	you 're right ! self-pity never got anyone anywhere . let 's go back and finish our dinner .
oh , do you like it ? i 'm not partial to desserts , but this is excellent .	who are you talking to ?
to you ! you just made a 'yummy ' sound , so i thought you liked the dessert .	i did n't make a 'yummy ' sound -- i just asked what it was .
but you did -- i just heard it .	it was n't me .
better not get too close , master . this guy could kill you .	i suppose you 're right . inga ! prepare a sedative , just in case .
it 's trying to talk . it wants us to take off the straps .	do n't fall for that one .
but do n't you see ... the brain of hans delbruck is inside this grotesque hulk -- pleading with us . i 've got to untie it .	careful , master -- you never can tell with these chaps .
original .	give -- me -- your -- hand !
whew ! i 'm glad that 's over with .	you can say that again .
yes .	you 're just supposed to repeat what you said .
what 's the point of my setup ? it 's not funny unless you repeat exactly what you said .	i 'm not trying to be funny .
repeat it anyway -- it 's a wonderful cue .	... i 'm glad that 's ...
no , no ! that whole thing !	... whew ! i 'm glad that 's over with .
it seem to have stopped the big fellow in his tracks .	ayegor ! find out where that music is coming from as quietly and as blindingly fast as you can .

where is he ?	how do you know it was a 'he ' ?

thanks ... for all your help .	that 's what we 're paid for .
i 'm a failure .	come on , froderick -- none of that .
what monster ?	what d'ya mean `` what monster ? ' you remember ... the one we madein the basement .
you do n't understand , master . the big fellow 's broken in and kidnapped your fiancee .	what ? ? ?
no ! the only hope now is to get him back here . if i can just find a way to relieve the pressure on his cerebellum ...	that sound good , boss .
... and equalize the imbalance in his cerebrospinal fluid ...	i like your style , master . how do we get him here ?
there 's only one way .	i 'll bet it 's a doozy .
come on , big fellow !	is everything ready ?
yes , master . are you sure you want to go through with it ?	it 's the only way .

mmmmmmmmmm ! mmmmmmmmmmmm !	wait ! stop ! do n't give them the satisfaction . i know it 's tough , but look at how far we 've come ! are you going to throw it all away now ? ?
mmmmmmmmm .	do n't you think i know that ? but what are you judging by ? bucharest ? ? ? this was always a hick town . they ca n't get a 'bus and truck ' company to come in here . are you going to let these idiots get the best of you ? ... or are you going to stand up like a man and show them that you 've got more dignity in your little finger than they 've got in all their beer- bloated bodies put together ?
what 's that tune that you 're playing	zis is an old transylvanian lullaby .
may i see your violin ?	it 's an honor for me , sir . you play the violin ?
nice ! nice little balance to it .	ja , ja .
extremely well .	how nice .
did you have a pleasant trip ?	yes , thank you . it was n't bad .
did you ever have a roll in the hay ?	i 'm not sure i ... get your drift .
sometimes i 'm afraid of the lightning .	just an atmospheric discharge . nothing to be afraid of .
are you busy ?	that 's quite all right . what is it , dear ?
could i lie down in your bed for a little while ? i just ca n't sleep .	we only arrived a few minutes ago .
i know , but usually i can fall asleep right away . it must be the strange room .	well ...
oh please -- just till i get sleepy . then you can force me right back to my room .	well.. i suppose it would be all right , for just a little while .
would you like a sandwich ?	no , thanks ! i want to get right to sleep .
inga !	yes , you may ... but do n't make any noise .
inga , wake up !	what is it ? is something wrong , doctor ?
listen ! do n't you hear that strange music ?	yes ! what could it be at this hour ?
dr. fronkonsteen -- look !	whatever it is , it 's coming from down there . i 'm going down to see .
let me come with you , doctor , please ! i do n't want to stay up here alone .	all right then , quietly ! close your robe and stay right behind me . do n't make a sound !
ooh !	what a filthy mess .
look , doctor !	well , this explains the music .
oh , doctor !	perhaps we 'd better leave .
'as the minuteness of the parts formed a great hindrance to my speed , i resolved to make the creature of a gigantic stature . ' of course ! that would simplify everything .	and look at this , doctor !
soon , all the electrical secrets of heaven shall be mine .	oh , frederick ... you 're not only a great doctor , you 're a great ... you 're almost a ...
a god ?	yes !
right here ?	raise the platform , hurry !
reputation . reputation !	i thought it was wonderful .
it was n't me .	look here - if it was n't you , and it was n't you , and it was n't me ...
oh , doctor !	i think you 've done it , master .
it looks that way .	what do you think we should do ?
what are you going to do ?	i think i 'll ... carry him .
do you think you can sing it ?	me ? sing ?
i 'd be so nervous .	this is not the finals -- just sing !
it has a pas-sion , 'the con-ti nen-tal ... '	stop -- singing ! ! !
all right -- give it to him !	are you serious ? ?
give him the sedative !	oh ! yes , doctor .
did you do it ?	i think so .
good night , doctor .	good night !
why , doctor ... how wonderful for you .	wonderful ? it 's terrible ! terrible , terrible , terrible , terrible , terrible !
just passing through the night .	what 's wrong , doctor ? you seem ... lonely .
oh , a little . but it 's not just physical loneliness . it 's the pangs that come from missing someone intellectually ... as i have you .	i 've missed you intellectually , too , doctor .
it 's terrible -- the price society demands in the name of fidelity ... ultimately ?	not fooling around .
i know , but i mean -- not fooling around physically ? ... or not fooling around intellectually ?	i see what you mean .
there can never ... ever ... be anything physical between us . you know that , dear .	i know frederick .
it would n't be fair to elizabeth .	of course not .
what ?	i say , it would n't be fair to you ... or to me .
nor to elizabeth .	no . nor to elizabeth .
and elizabeth has hers .	yes , elizabeth has hers .
yes , i have mine .	and i have mine .
yes ... yes , you have yours .	why do n't we talk inside ?
yes , i know .	it would n't be fair to her .
yes , i know .	you 've got to help me to remain faithful .
yes , i will .	... but an intellectual relationship , like this -- we could have as often as we wanted . three times a day -- anything !
all right if i turn out the lamp , sweetheart ?	mmmmm .
mmmmmmmmm !	yes , sweetie ... i heard you . so ! i 'm ready for you , meine liebe .
are you ready for me ?	mmmmmmmmm !
ready for fuchsmachen ? ? ?	mmmmmmmmmmmmmmm !

his what ? ?	his schwanzstucker .
it 's working ! oh , doctor -- you play beautifully .	do you know the theme from 'doctor zhivago ' ?
i 'm getting tired .	why do n't we all turn in ? it 's been a long day .
look how far we 've come .	you ca n't expect to iron out all the kinks in one night .
i think the doctor is a genius ! do n't you , igor ?	why certainly . do n't you , frau blucher ?
how do you know they 're done ?	the doctor said to allow seven minutes : no more and no less -- or else they could both become hopelessly paralyzed .
how long is it so far ?	four
three minutes to go !	yes .
what d'ya want to do to kill time ?	oh , igor -- i 'm so afraid ! i just hope this all ends well .
igor -- are you sure the monster has a good brain ? are you absolutely certain that you took the brain of hans delbruck that night ?	absolutely ! may my mother grow two heads if i 'm not telling the truth .
	sounds like visitors . it 's all right -- frau blucher will show them in .
oh , must be around ten ... ten-thirty .	igor -- the clock ! hurry !
another fifteen seconds to go .	do something ! stall them !
